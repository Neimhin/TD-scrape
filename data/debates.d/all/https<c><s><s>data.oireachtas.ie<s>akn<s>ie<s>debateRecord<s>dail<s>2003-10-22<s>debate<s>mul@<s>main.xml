        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Everyone in the House will share the disappointment of the people of Northern Ireland and the entire island at the outcome of yesterday's events. What began as a day of huge promise ended with the process clouded in uncertainty. Elections held in the current context could have fatal consequences for the process. In the Taoiseach's absence I commended him, his colleagues and the British Prime Minister for their continuing efforts to resolve this complex matter. My party remains committed to assisting in every way the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Is the Taoiseach satisfied that what was on offer from yesterday's measures was an act of completion as set out in the joint declaration last April? Does he consider that it amounted to a complete end to all paramilitary activity and a process to complete decommissioning?</p>
          <p eId="para_3">Was the Taoiseach aware of the details of the agreement or understanding reached between David Trimble and Gerry Adams which appears to be central to the issue of an acceptable level of transparency in respect of the extent of wea pons and armoury decommissioned in this third act of decommissioning by the IRA? Was the Taoiseach aware of the detail and the level of agreement between the two people involved?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I thank Deputy Kenny for his ongoing support in this effort. I will make a more detailed statement later. What we sought yesterday was to address the complex issue, as Deputy Kenny said, of closure of the conflict based around an act of completion – the phrase we have used for the past year – and to generate confidence and hope for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I would not be honest if I did not say that I am deeply disappointed that our efforts failed. We will continue in our efforts with the British Government and others to try to find a solution to the issue. It is important that we examine what was achieved because it must be maintained. We set out with certain aims and we must be careful that we build on what we have achieved and not lose it. That is my greatest concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">No one contradicted me when I said to the parties yesterday that one issue remained to be resolved, namely, decommissioning. However, the level of understanding that had been reached  before that difficulty arose should be stressed. The British Government announced the date of the election to the Northern Ireland Assembly – 26 November. Many people, North and South, felt this election should have taken place last May. It is proceeding now. We wanted to ensure it took place in a positive environment. Through intensive engagement, agreement was reached between the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin that suggested the possibility of new hope and confidence for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Deputy Kenny's first question was whether we believe that what we understand to be paragraph 13 was included in that. We have discussed it with both parties. In our view, together with the endorsement by the IRA which we have always said was essential, it represents an unequivocal commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. It also defines for the first time the goal to which we are working, namely, the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. These two points are essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The Deputy's second point is slightly more complicated. I was aware of the details of the different issues that arose in the conversation between David Trimble and Sinn Féin through Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and different delegations that changed on several occasions. I was aware of these discussions and what they were going to say during the day. The nuance might have changed but I was aware of the content. I also exchanged that information with other parties to whom I spoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">My concern all along, and it was obvious to anyone observing this closely that there was a problem, was that the one person with whom we were not dealing was the IRA representative in the area of decommissioning. We had no contact with this person who was dealing with the International Independent Commission on Decommissioning. While General John de Chastelain is a polite and gracious man, he is also very conscious of his independence and the legislation and regulations under which his commission is established. He deals strictly on that basis. That was the issue to which I was referring in recent days when I said there were some issues over which we have no control.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Until 2.30 p.m. yesterday, until General John de Chastelain presented his report and told us what he could or could not say – in many cases what he could not say because he had a confidentiality agreement under the regulations which he was totally within his entitlement, we did not know the outcome. Of course, if we did not know, then Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness did not know and neither did David Trimble. I always felt that was a difficulty, even though we got through on 24 October 2001 and in April 2002 on that basis. People could immediately say that more clarity and detail were required.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">General John de Chastelain gave a large amount of detail. For instance, he said it included automatic weapons, ammunition, explosives,  explosive materiel. He said the act of decommissioning was the largest ever, significantly more than was ever seen. The weapons being put out of use were modern, useable, fully operational, in proper working condition and permanently beyond use within the terms of the decommissioning legislation. The materiel if used could cause death and destruction on a very large scale. There were different types of weaponry than on previous occasions. This was all stated by General de Chastelain but he could not say it consisted of 95 of this, 36 of that or 11 of the other and I knew that he could not say that. I always said the potential was there for somebody to say that they needed to know the exact amount. Equally I have been dealing with this for long enough to fully understand why he could not say so and I appreciate all the difficulties that causes. It might be complex but it is easy to have a one-liner – and nobody in this House has done that – such as it could have been a rusty bullet or gun. The fact is that it was not and everybody knows that.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">There is the difficulty as it exists. I do not believe in recriminations that serve no purpose and will get me nowhere. I admit I was deeply frustrated last night but this is a new day and we must get on with it. We have a point to clarify but we should not ignore the fact that we made significant progress yesterday. We came down on the detail of one issue and we have to move on from there.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_13">I accept that the Taoiseach has been through this in considerable detail over the last number of years. I think it quite extraordinary that an unknown representative of the Provisional IRA is in a position to impose a vow of silence upon two Prime Ministers—</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_14">It is the legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_15">—in respect of such a critical deal. I do not wish to say or do anything that would prevent progress being made from here on.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Before the process was announced, the Taoiseach signalled that there was one outstanding problem. In taking the risk, was the Taoiseach happy that Downing Street was aware of the implications and the extent of that problem? In his understanding of the agreement worked out between Mr. Trimble and Mr. Adams and his awareness of what both men were supposed to say, is he happy that from the Adams element of that agreement he was going to be in a position to deliver on the unknown representative of the IRA? Was the Taoiseach and his negotiating team happy that Gerry Adams, with this unknown representative, would be able to provide a sufficient level of transparency and clarity as to the extent of what was being decommissioned? Does the Taoiseach consider that if this sticking point is not resolved, holding the election in this context could have serious consequences for the entire process?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_6">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_17">My view on the election is that it should take place anyway. All the parties want that. Our plan was to ensure the election would take place in a positive environment that would best ensure the re-establishment of the Assembly and the Executive. Anything that damages that plan is difficult and I have no doubt it would cause significant problems in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The reason we were concentrating recently on Sinn Féin and the UUP was that they were the two parties which lost trust and confidence a year ago. That was why the institutions collapsed and that is where the difficulties lay. I know that is frustrating for people but we did our best to keep people informed. That is where the problem was and we had to try to solve the problem as best we could.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">On the question of what Gerry Adams or anybody else knew, I think everybody knew. It was not a secret and that was my concern. The legislation and the regulations were in place and the procedure followed was the same as on the previous occasion. That was the basis for achieving decommissioning and getting arms put beyond use in a verifiable way. In reply to the Deputy's question, Downing Street was well aware of my fear because even yesterday morning I was quite reluctant to leave here because I was unable to make contact with General John de Chastelain, even to find out what was happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">I understood it would be possible for me to talk to General de Chastelain at 6.30 p.m. on Monday but the first time I was able to make contact with him was when I walked into Hillsborough yesterday evening. That did not help but I have to try and pick it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Yesterday we set out to achieve an enormous amount and I think we achieved it all. The position is on the detail of what can and cannot be said. There is an obvious way of dealing with this and we will make an attempt at the obvious way but unfortunately, as Deputy Kenny will appreciate, I can talk to anybody in this process except the people who might be able to help. However, we will try and I believe Sinn Féin will attempt to help us. It is not easy for them either and I understand their difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I also understand that we must be very careful that the excellent relationship which has been built up for the first time in this process between Sinn Féin and the UUP is not damaged more than it was last night. I hope it will not be. I plead with everybody to move the process on in a positive manner.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_23">I am sure the Taoiseach will understand if I say that most people who want to see the success of the peace process were puzzled that events into which so much planning and preparation had been invested could have such a setback because of apparent limits placed by the IRA on what General de Chastelain might say.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I know there will be an opportunity for Members to make statements in the House later in the day but I wish to follow the Taoiseach's  explanation to Deputy Kenny for a moment. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said this morning that it was a problem of presentation. The Taoiseach stated he did not get an opportunity to speak to General de Chastelain until 2.30 p.m. yesterday. I presume he means that he did have an opportunity to talk to General de Chastelain at whatever length was necessary prior to the statement being made by him.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">I note that the Taoiseach at his second press conference last night went out of his way to draw our attention to the fact that decommissioning is a statutory process. In other words, there are statutory provisions guiding the circumstances in which the commission may report and in what circumstances information may be disclosed, for example, in the interests of public safety or to the two Governments. It is clear that there is an imposition of confidentiality, subject to those provisions, on the commission but it would not appear that there is any such statutory imposition on the two Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Will the Taoiseach address how he thinks the process can proceed from here? Is it his understanding that there is no such imposition of confidentiality on the two Governments, although I understand there may be other impositions on them as a result of discussions? Are there circumstances in which the two Governments can address this question? I raise this specifically in the context of Prime Minister Blair's comment that if Mr. Trimble and the rest of us were to know what he, the Taoiseach, the IRA and General de Chastelain know, we would all be satisfied. It is especially frustrating if that is the case – that the information in the possession of the two Governments would satisfy the people on this island, including the Unionist community. If that is the case, are there any circumstances in which the Taoiseach could envisage the two Governments moving to break the logjam?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_27">The two Governments will have to move to break the logjam. Deputy Rabbitte's question is an important one which we spent much of yesterday discussing. The position with regard to confidentiality which, as I said, I knew about, is dealt with in the Decommissioning Act 1997 and section 13 of the supplementary regulations 2001. These provide that, "The Commission shall ensure that all information received by it in relation to making arms permanently inaccessible or unusable is kept confidential." However, the regulations also state, "The Commission may disclose information received by it where such disclosure is necessary . . . to discharge the duty of the Commission to report to the Government and the Government of the United Kingdom."</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Two issues arise, namely, why does the IRA insist on confidentiality and, as Deputy Rabbitte asked, what can the Governments say? I am not in a position to answer for the IRA or the way in which it decides to conduct its business. From the discussions we had with the Independent Inter national Commission on Decommissioning, my understanding is that the IRA believes that unless it proceeds in its dealings with the commission on the basis of confidentiality, it would damage rather than enhance its prospects of putting all arms beyond use as quickly as possible. I sincerely hope it will revisit this thinking, at least in respect of yesterday's act. The Government will receive a full inventory of what the IRA has put beyond use at the end of the process. The IRA is aware of this. It is important to know that an inventory is made each time which will be held by the commission with the intention of providing it at the end of the process. It is not a case, as some cynics have said – though I hasten to add they are not in this House – of a rusty bullet and a broken gun from the First World War. I already put on the record what was said yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">In answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question, the reason the Governments cannot move on is due to Mr. Trimble's second question in regard to the decommissioning process not only being more verifiable but also that it must continue. That is addressed in the second IRA statement yesterday when it said that the IRA leadership is committed to resolving this issue. It went on to state:</p>
          <p eId="para_30">In line with our stated position we have authorised a representative to meet with the IICD with a view to proceeding with the implementation of a process to put arms beyond use at the earliest opportunity. We have also authorised a further act of putting arms beyond use. This will be verified under the agreed scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">It is our view – and this is the key point – that if we break the current arrangement with General John de Chastelain and if we were to give the full extent of what he told us yesterday, and he did not tell us everything, that would end that process. The second part of David Trimble's demand would bring the scheme to an end. I can understand why that is so. The IRA clearly stated what it would do and that it would be done within the verified scheme. There is an understanding between General John de Chastelain and the IRA representative as to what he can and cannot say. If that is broken by the Governments – and we did think about that yesterday – we would end that scheme. That is his judgment and I believe him to be correct on the issue. Such a course of action would solve last night's problem but it would bring that process to an end under the present arrangement, and the second question put by David Trimble was whether the process will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">I do not wish to say too much about the issue of presentation, as suggested by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. That is a fact but there are rules, legislation and commissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">I was very hopeful yesterday when I heard that these arms could have caused death and destruction on a gigantic scale. However, it does not sound as exciting when expressed in the military terminology of the commission. Yesterday we  heard that the decommissioning comprised light, medium and heavy ordnance and associated munitions, including automatic weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive material. It was also stated that the quantity of arms involved was larger than any previous decommissioning event and that the weapons were modern, usable, fully operational and in working order.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Things have moved on considerably since an occasion under a previous British Government when it was said to me that one bullet would solve the whole problem. Unfortunately it has not moved on enough for the UUP and we have to keep at it.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">The Taoiseach almost seems to be saying that if General de Chastelain had issued a written statement couched in certain language it would have been adequate to meet the circumstances. Does the Taoiseach consider that there is any impediment to him calling on the IRA in the House to release the commission from the imposition of confidentiality that seems to impede further progress?</p>
          <p eId="para_36">With the benefit of hindsight, does he consider it a mistake to exclude the SDLP and other parties from the equality of involvement they had heretofore? The SDLP has made no secret of its concern that it has been effectively sidelined. Its involvement dates back to the origins of this process and it could properly claim a role in the authorship of the process. It has also had the experience of failure and perhaps its involvement, together with the other excluded parties, might have headed off the impasse that the process is now in.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">Last night I called on the Sinn Féin leadership to try and help us resolve these issues. I hope it can do so. While the British Prime Minister and I do not rule out the possibility of saying more about what we were told yesterday, it would be unwise to contemplate that course without giving the IICD the chance to resolve the difficulty through direct contact with the IRA. If the Governments were to act without affording the IRA and the IICD the opportunity to develop a new position, it would damage the contact between those bodies and might do irreparable damage to the process of putting arms beyond use. Yesterday morning's event was not the last.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I have not only well understood the SDLP; I have heard the same line from the Alliance Party and the Women's Coalition. I continually meet the parties. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and I have met the SDLP a great deal in the current period. As always, if things had worked out last night I would have used the best language to describe the progress we had made. Much of what has been raised has been the brainchild of the SDLP and the party has contributed to the progress we have made on policing. I said that last night and the parties were aware of it.  The difficulty on the issue in question is that the SDLP does not have any guns and, as such, it does not bring anything to the process of decommissioning. Thankfully, the party is not in that business, nor has it ever been. Its role does not involve it in the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning although it is involved in everything else. The SDLP is involved in all other positive elements of the process, which is something we act to maintain. We did that last Saturday when almost every member of the Cabinet met the leadership of the SDLP following a meeting last Wednesday at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met the SDLP a few days after me.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">The PUP, whose members I met last week, has an involvement in the issue of arms and I have discussed that with its representatives. The remaining difficulties were not issues in respect of which the SDLP could make a contribution. Of course, the party has a contribution to make on policing and we keep the party fully briefed about every move in that regard. The SDLP has taken the lead on this issue, which is why we have taken our lead from it following the Weston Park talks of summer 2001. We continue to keep the SDLP fully involved. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that we would not be here if it were not for the SDLP's work over the last number of decades. All parties continually ask why we do not invite everybody to sit at the table at all times. I assure Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny that I pray for the day when that is possible. It is far easier to meet everybody together than to have to meet each group painstakingly for hours on end. Unfortunately, when one invites everybody, somebody walks out in the middle of proceedings, somebody starts a row about something that is not on the agenda or somebody does not turn up but instead holds a simultaneous press conference to explain that. All parties are working on the group on the bill of rights, except the UUP, which we cannot get to attend. I pray for the day when it will be a simple question of asking all groups to come to the table together.</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I appeal to the Taoiseach to answer the question today. Is he the least bit uncomfortable that working men and women from Finglas and other working class Dublin communities are peremptorily thrown in prison within days of peacefully protesting against a new stealth tax imposed by his Government while in the boardrooms of the major banks, the organised theft of up to €1 billion takes place but no banker has even darkened the door of a courthouse? Does the Taoiseach see a contrast there and, if so, can he explain it? Will the Taoiseach suspend the crude policy of the non-collection of taxpayers' household bins to allow us to continue the debate on this taxation and environmental policy in a normal manner?</p>
          <p eId="para_57">If extra funds are needed in the meantime, the Taoiseach can amend legislation to provide for a shakedown of, and an equitable tax contribution from, the multi-millionaire tax exiles, many of whom are frequently seen in his company at prestigious social and sporting events.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_27">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_58">The Deputy has asked me a number of questions. The Office of Environmental Enforcement is being launched today by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It will have the power to impose fines of up to €15 million on businesses and local authorities. A very tough and consistent line is being taken against polluters in the business sector. The percentage of Dublin households which have paid or applied for a waiver is very large and includes almost everyone. The objectives of the Dublin regional waste management plan are 59% recycling, 25% thermal treatment and 16% landfill. The infrastructure of thermal treatment plants and landfill sites will be of a size appropriate to take those percentages of the waste stream to enable us to reach the recycling target. Enormous progress has been made and 225 bring centres have been established across Dublin city and county to accommodate the various recyclable materials. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is investing several million euro in the next few years to increase the number to more than 400 sites. An enormous increase will be announced before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">The Deputy is aware of my view on the law. The Judiciary is independent and must deal with contempt. If one is guilty of contempt of court procedures must be followed. No one is being jailed for protesting. People from various organisations have the democratic right to protest freely outside this House each day about the various issues of concern to them. These people are  rarely troubled by the long arm of the law, let alone the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">On the points made by Deputy Joe Higgins in regard to landfill, 86.5% of waste went into landfill in 2001 while 13.5% was recycled. In 2001 more than 100,000 tonnes of glass was landfilled. This is equivalent to 320 million bottles and jars which, if laid end to end, would stretch from New York and back 160 times.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">This cannot continue. One must deal with disposables and other issues. Some 2.7 million tonnes of household and commercial waste was generated two years ago. This was an increase of 46% on eight years previously. The number of bring banks has increased by 337% to almost 1,500. Just 5.6% of household waste was recycled two years ago while the figure in Holland is almost 60%. We now have legislation and a plan. I respectfully ask Deputy Joe Higgins to join the race against waste campaign and try to help us to deal with the issue, whether in relation to householders, business, agriculture or the construction sector. I have no doubt that pressure from his organisation could have a huge impact on these figures in a very short time.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_64">I would like to have a comprehensive debate with the Taoiseach on a sound environmental policy on waste management. The fact is that 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of paper and glass went from households and commercial outlets to landfill last year, which is an incredible failure on the part of the Government. This could be diverted if the infrastructure for recycling and separation was put in place in all areas. Councils have full powers to introduce by-laws to ensure that not a single glass bottle or paper goes to landfill. The Government's policy in this regard has been a total failure and this apocalyptic advertisement is designed to cover up that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">Important as that is, the Taoiseach, very cleverly as usual, went after one hare that was running around this morning but forgot much faster ones. Incidentally, I would prefer to be in contempt of court than to have contempt for the rights and equitable treatment of ordinary working class people.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">The central point here is the mass dichotomy in taxation treatment of working people and the privileged minority. Does the Taoiseach defend Mr. O'Brien walking away with a profit of €300 million from the resources of the Irish people, going into tax exile and refusing to pay €50 million that should be due to the social fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Some 18 householders from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown are in the High Court this morning on foot of injunctions. Why is such a parade of ordinary taxpayers before the courts? What does the Taoiseach say to the mass scam in the banks revealed by the Revenue Commissioners amount ing to a theft of up to €1,000 million? This could not have been organised without the knowledge of those in the boardrooms. Will a single senior boardroom member of the prestigious banks involved in this tax fraud be put into prison? Will the Taoiseach suspend this brutal policy of non-collection?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_68">The Deputy will acknowledge that what has happened on recycling in a short period is very impressive. Treatment plants are coming on stream in the next number of years that will allow the separate collection of the combustible waste of approximately 70% of Dublin homes. We are bringing ourselves into line with what is happening successfully internationally and it behoves us all to move from where we have been in this regard. The reality in Dublin is that landfill will run out by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Deputy Joe Higgins and I have no disagreement on tax equity. There should be equity in the tax system. The low taxes this Government has introduced should be complied with fully. We have done away with many exemptions, reliefs and shelters that existed. The Revenue has been given powers in this area and it is examining the case of the individual referred to by the Deputy. The Government gave the Revenue these powers and introduced a fair tax system so that people would comply. The powers and sentences exist for the courts to deal with people who are in breach of their tax obligations. We want to have an equitable tax system where people are rewarded for generating activity, being innovative and creating employment, but they must comply fully with the tax rules. Whenever there are scams or breaches of these obligations we quickly amend the law. The Government has never been slow to do so.</p>

In the IFSC companies there is the expertise of the individuals and, as it happens, in those areas there is a high number of women in insurance, funds management groups and so on. In the other ones, I endeavour to ensure that the representation is kept up to the standard at least. It is always an ongoing issue with the social partners to ensure there is representation of women. I think that position is improving and we are getting more representatives. It is a continual battle to try to achieve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">I have no plans in respect of major appointments to bring forward any arrangement for the Oireachtas or committees to approve those put forward. I do not think it is necessary. We should continue to strive in this area. We had this debate before. I agree with the point made that we should at all times try to get the best people for the boards and people with the highest qualifications and standards. The reality nowadays, given all the regulations and statutory obligations on individuals, is that it is not as easy as it was in the past to get people of the highest standing on to the boards. We have to continue to insist on that and get people of the highest standards.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I welcome the Taoiseach's comments about women being highly qualified in the financial services area. Does he ever discuss this issue with the Minister for Finance? I am concerned at the absence of women from the board of the Central Bank and also about the small number of women directors in the National Pensions Reserve Fund group. Does the Taoiseach discuss the 40% requirement with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, because he seems to think it does not apply to him, for the most part?</p>

          <p eId="para_84">The policing of the arrangement does not come within my functional area but I strongly support it. It is now happening across the financial area. Many of the key people in the working groups under the aegis of my Department are women. It has been that way for a number of years and is strengthening all the time. I am very grateful to them because it is  through their efforts the financial services are doing so well. Even in more difficult times in fund management and in other areas the financial services figures are enormously successful and this country is gaining. I am not going to answer for the other boards. In this area I am not alone pro-women being on the boards but I am very grateful that they give their time to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">We have addressed this issue a number of times in the House. Would the Taoiseach agree there is a need for greater transparency and accountability in these appointments, for a process of advertisement where those with the appropriate qualifications and the necessary interest in the focus of the particular board could apply and that the current system gives rise to the reasonable accusation of cronyism and political favouritism on the part of successive Governments? The change I have outlined here in the past, and again today, would be an important development.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">I wish to ask a specific question in regard to the National Economic and Social Forum which has significant Oireachtas representation. Since the General Election of May 2002, is the Oireachtas representation on the NESF reflective of the new political configuration within this Chamber? Can the Taoiseach advise what appointments have been made to the NESF over the period? How many positions have been filled and are some outstanding that have still to be addressed?</p>

          <p eId="para_90">To take the last question first, as I understand it the position has changed. The composition of the Oireachtas strand of the National Economic and Social Forum has changed since 2002 to reflect the changed composition of the Houses. The term of office of other members has expired and is currently being reconstituted. I understand the answer to that is "Yes". I will check if there are any vacancies.</p>

My note informs me that the membership of NESF comprises representatives from the following four strands: 15 Oireachtas Members based on the composition of the Oireachtas and it goes on to give the other categ ories. It should have been based on that composition. I will send the Deputy a note on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">On the Deputy's first point, I do not want to argue it out again at great length but because there is accountability I am answering Deputy Kenny's questions on this matter. Accountability is to the Oireachtas. Whatever the composition of the Government of the day, it has to make appointments to State boards. The position is not the same as it was ten years ago. Now there are enormous regulatory controls and powers. The reality is that if one were to advertise the positions and people were to reply it would not work. What happens nowadays – I am not saying it was lax in the past – is that any Minister will have a difficulty in getting the necessary expertise. The responsibilities to which individuals sign up now are demanding. It is not a question of people writing in but rather that one is out there trying hard to fill the boards. That is the way it is and more so every year.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_97">Deputy Ó Caoláin has a valid point. Does the Taoiseach understand that boards are not only accountable to the Oireachtas but that the Oireachtas has responsibilities to those boards also? The NESF should be able to benefit from the diversity of political views here and, accordingly, the Green Party should be represented as well as Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Would the Taoiseach support the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who has said he would introduce legislation blacking the 40% of Departments which do not follow Government policy on this matter? On boards under the aegis of the Departments of Finance and Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources women's representation is of the order of 14%. Will he support the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in his efforts in that regard or is the Minister of State to be left to do a solo run on that matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_99">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is setting a worthwhile example in insisting that all appointees to boards and agencies under his aegis must demonstrate they are tax compliant. Will the Taoiseach follow through on that for every Department? We support it. Does he envisage the tax compliance requirement being more rigorous than it was perhaps for Deputy Michael Collins, rather than accepting the status quo?</p>

          <p eId="para_100">I support the position of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, with regard to the 40% and I continually press for that. Many boards, particularly boards for which I answer, the social partnership boards, other bodies, a range of organisations and most Departments now have nominating bodies. This provision has been in the legislation for the past 20-25 years. It is difficult to get many organisations to nominate women. The position is improving with the social partners but it is difficult with some of the other bodies. Whether it is that there are no suitable women, they do not think the women are qualified or there is a bias against them, I cannot say. It is an ongoing battle to get women on the boards and we will continue to press the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">I know the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, presses for tax compliance as do other Ministers. I agree that this is a matter on which we should follow through.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 10, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">On Wednesday, 29 October, I will receive Mr. Justice Barron's report into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974. I thank Mr. Justice Barron and his team for all their work in preparing the report and for their commitment and dedication to this difficult task.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The bombings were an appalling atrocity, which left a terrible legacy of pain and suffering for the victims and their families. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the group Justice for the Forgotten for its work on behalf of the families and for its assistance to the independent inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">It is envisaged that, following consideration by Government, Mr. Justice Barron's report will be referred to the Oireachtas and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. The Government envisages that the report will be published by the committee and that it will consider the report in public session.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">I understand that Mr. Justice Barron will, in the coming weeks, report on the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 and, early in the new year, on the other cases referred to him including the Dundalk bombing and the Seamus Ludlow case.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The establishment of the inquiry followed on from the recommendations of the report of the Victims Commission, the sole member of which  was the former Tánaiste, John Wilson. That report also made recommendations regarding payments to victims of the Troubles in Northern Ireland in this jurisdiction. The remembrance fund is now established and applications for funding of the kind suggested by Mr. Wilson will be invited shortly. The total cost of the commission to date is €1.5 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">When does the Taoiseach expect the five-person commission to be appointed to administer the compensation scheme? Following the confirmation of the discovery of the body of Jean McConville, which after so many years must be a consolation to her family, has he taken any steps to make further representation in respect of the disappeared whose bodies have never been located? Is he taking whatever action he can to ensure the IRA and other paramilitary groups, where involved, will continue to make every effort to ensure the bodies of the disappeared will be located and returned to their families for burial?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_59">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_120">It is expected the commission will be in a position to seek applications for payments under the various categories of the proposed scheme shortly. The establishment work is being finalised and I understand the commission will be available to start in November. A sum of €9 million, which will be administered through the remembrance fund, is being provided over three years to address the needs of the victims in this jurisdiction. The fund comes under the Vote of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">The Department has met with Justice for the Forgotten and outlined to the group the basis on which payments will be made from the fund. It might be worthwhile stating these for Deputy Kenny. There will be acknowledgement payments of €15,000 to each of the bereaved families of persons who were either killed in or resident in this jurisdiction at the time of their death. Lump sums will be paid to spouses and dependent children of victims killed in this jurisdiction or resident here at the time of their death, and any injured victim, subject to the conditions of the amounts not exceeding €15,000 per applicant. Unless already covered by payments under the previous two categories mentioned, unmet and continuing medical costs to cover vouched medical expenses including home help expenses not already paid by some other body or State agency will be paid. Relocation payments of up to €15,000, subject to conditions, will be paid to people who have had to move as a direct consequence of the conflict. Payment of a grant to the Northern Ireland memorial fund and the payment for the counselling needs of persons in this jurisdiction who are injured as a direct result of the conflict in Northern Ireland will be met by the health boards or by the victim support groups such as Justice for the Forgotten. The scheme will be up and running within the next few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">On the issue of the disappeared, over the summer months we continued to receive information through political, community and religious sources. In all cases the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Defence and the Garda try to locate the bodies. They must decide if it is worth starting individual digs. They have carried out many digs in different areas, including some this past summer. They will continue to monitor the locations identified through information, particularly in summer months, to try to find any more of the bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">This is enormously important to the families. I have met many of them and they appreciate the efforts being made. Often the information is not adequate. Locations have changed and the geology of an area may have changed for one reason or another. In the case of Jean McConville, we were lucky. It was not as a result of last year's dig that her body was found. Other cases will continue to be examined. John Wilson, representatives of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others will continue to take an active interest. John Wilson still visits the sites with members of the security forces to see what may happen. He takes a big interest in solving the problems of the families.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">The appointment of the five-person commission to administer the fund passed me by. When were the appointments made to the commission and has the Taoiseach given the names of those appointed?</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The Barron report is not the only one that has been received by the Government. It has also received the Cory and Nally reports. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is important we do not allow the impression to be created that because any of the contents of either of these reports might be potentially embarrassing, or subject to whatever excisions are considered necessary for security reasons, they are not being put into the public domain? I understand he has said the Barron report will be published via the relevant Oireachtas committee. What is his intention with regard to those other two reports?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_61">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_126">According to my notes, the commission is ready to commence its work in November. I do not actually have the names, but I assume they have been cleared and I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to name the individuals. As soon as the Government clears the Barron report, we will bring it to the committee as promised. The Cory report is now being assessed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Our intention is to bring it to Government and to publish it. Talks are ongoing. Our reports are relatively straightforward as regards publication, but we are anxious that the British Government publish its reports, which are far more complex. We are seeking to have all the reports published as quickly as possible and, if possible, jointly. If  there is too much delay on the British side, we will have to go ahead, but I would like to get them published. There are some matters we will have to investigate. I agree totally with Deputy Rabbitte's comment that it is better to have this in the public domain. These issues have gone on for too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I am very conscious of the other report. As Deputies are aware, I have been dealing for a long time with many of the families which are the subjects of these reports. This Government and previous Governments have given commitments in this area. I am trying to avoid a long delay in the examination of these reports within the British system. Our reports will be ready quite soon. I have not yet received a date as to when the British are likely to publish, but it will certainly happen before the end of the year. I made a promise on this to Mrs. Geraldine Finucane, the Hamill family and the other families involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I have not been dealing with the Nally report in which I understand there are many sensitive issues. To the best of my knowledge, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to make a fairly detailed statement about that in his next Question Time if he has not already done so.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">It is known that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform received the report some time ago. The expectation was that subject to whatever excisions were necessary, it would be laid before the House. In his most recent Question Time, the anticipated comprehensive statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was not forthcoming. All of this just serves to create an impression that for some reason the Government is dragging its heels on putting the report into the public domain.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">Do I understand that the substantive Barron report will be published within the next few weeks? Is that the essence of the Taoiseach's reply? He indicated that there would be ancillary reports, addenda to the substantive report with specific focuses. Will that cover the entire range of the areas of investigation the Taoiseach has signposted here over a period of time, including the bombing of Belturbet in County Cavan in 1972, where two young teenagers were killed? When does the Taoiseach expect Mr. Justice Barron will complete his full raft of investigations and will he outline how he sees the outworking of the publication of the substantive report referring specifically to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of May 1974, following its publication? How does he see that progressing?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_64">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_131">During the course of his work, Mr. Justice Barron was asked to take on some additional cases although I cannot recall what they were. I do not know whether the 1972 Belturbet case was included, but whatever he  undertook to formally investigate will be reported on. His main task was to deal with the 1972 and 1974 bombings and he intends to do that in his full report. Mr. Justice Barron has covered much of the work on some of these other issues along the way and has carried out specific investigations into some, but he is anxious to do those in a separate report. He has not finished all his work, but has completed a great deal of it, because the investigations were carried out <i>seriatim.</i> He will be a few more months on those which include the Dundalk bombing and the Seamus Ludlow case which has been raised in this House time and time again. The late Mr. Justice Hamilton started the work on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">There was an agreement in the House at the outset as to how we should deal with this. It was agreed the Government would receive the report and consider it without undue delay. It would then lay the report before the committee where it would be taken in a public session. That was the agreement I entered into at the time and I intend to honour those arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">The members of the Justice for the Forgotten group want to know the reason for the delay in setting up the remembrance fund. There was an understanding it would be up and running by 1 September. Given that it was recommended following the Belfast Agreement, so long ago now, will the Taoiseach explain the delay and say what the revised timescale will be for the remembrance fund and the allocation of €9 million thereto over a three year period? As the Taoiseach did not give me an answer in a previous Question Time about whether the Government would have full access to the final report of the Stevens inquiry, is it possible for him to answer this time around?</p>

          <p eId="para_135">This may be an opportunity for the Taoiseach to clarify a matter that was left hanging in the air. Given that the Cory report relates to incidents in the meantime, is the Taoiseach still disappointed? He mentioned he would be disappointed if Mr. Justice Cory does not opt for a public inquiry into the Pat Finucane case and others. Is he still living in hope, or in disappointment?</p>

          <p eId="para_136">On the Stevens inquiry, the Deputy would have to table a question for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. There has been much movement and discussion on that issue, but I am not privy to the latest position. On the remembrance fund, there was much debate about how to structure the arrangements. That has now been agreed, the fund is up and running and the discussions between the Department and Justice for the Forgotten have concluded. Justice for the Forgotten is aware of the current position.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">Regarding the Cory report, we only have our sections of it concerned with Lord and Lady Gibson and the two police officers, the Buchanan case and the other one. We do not have the other reports at all. We are trying to structure an arrangement with the British Government to complete the process. They have far more work to do than we do because they have more reports to examine as well as difficulties and complexities in their cases, mainly the Finucane one. Every time I say that in this House Billy Wright's father gets very upset with me. Billy Wright's case will also be included as it is another important case. Mr. Wright, Billy Wright's father, follows the Dáil record attentively. I apologise for not including the Wright case. It is hoped that the reports will be issued by both Governments before Christmas.</p>

I gather from what is being said this morning that the report is being cleared and if sections of it are deemed to have implications for national security they will be removed. I would like clarification on that point. Surely if the committee is to consider this report in detail it will require the full unexpurgated report. Was that the commitment and is it still the commitment?</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Will the Taoiseach give us his view on the position of the relatives' group, Justice for the Forgotten, which represents the relatives and survivors of the bombing, that the report should form the basis of a full public inquiry?

          <p eId="para_149">The unit provides a media information service to Government Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of any relevant news developments. In this way, Departments are able to provide a better service to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">The communications unit works an 18-hour day based on a flexible rota of three working shifts. The unit is staffed by six established civil servants, five of whom are seconded from other Departments. The work of the unit means that Departments have greatly reduced their use of external companies and ensures they no longer duplicate work such as transcripts and tapes. It is conservatively estimated that in a full year the communications unit saves Government Departments approximately €175,000.</p>

Perhaps they could make recommendations with regard to priority shifting of money within Votes.

          <p eId="para_184">Yesterday, we were seeking to address the complex issues of closure of the Northern Ireland conflict and the generation of confidence and hope for the future. This morning, as I said, I must be honest in saying we are deeply disappointed that our efforts stalled. Most of all, I believe people were frustrated last evening with the fact that the difficulty encountered in this last chapter of the peace process was a matter of  some technical detail. We will continue our efforts with the British Government and others to find a solution to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">We went to Hillsborough yesterday in the light of the accommodation which appeared to have been reached between the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin, following months of intensive discussion. As I made clear on several occasions prior to yesterday, I had some concerns and hesitation, particularly in the area which eventually transpired to be the sticking point, that is, in regard to the decommissioning of weapons. However, I believed, as did Prime Minister Blair, that we should go to Belfast in the hope and expectation the deal could be sealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">By any standards, many of yesterday's statements and developments represented a very encouraging day for the peace process in Northern Ireland. Paradoxically, it was also one of the most frustrating. While a major breakthrough was made, its overall confidence building impact was eroded on account of a matter of detail or, more particularly, lack of detail. Yesterday, we were seeking to address the complex issue of closure of the Northern Ireland conflict and the generation of confidence and hope for the future. Although I am deeply disappointed that our efforts stalled, I am equally determined that we must try to resolve the outstanding issue, or possibly two related issues. As I explained to Deputy Rabbitte, although it has been portrayed as one issue, there is a related issue which can also affect the situation if not handled correctly.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I believe people were mainly frustrated that, in this last chapter of the peace process, the difficulty that had been encountered was essentially a matter of technicality and the detailed operation of the decommissioning body. I am not saying it is an easy issue but, in the context of all the other complex issues that we have handled, I cannot believe it will not be possible to resolve it. We will continue our efforts with the British Government and others to try to find a solution to the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Perhaps others will inevitably arise but as I said last night, in so far as I am aware, this one issue in the area of decommissioning is what remains to be resolved. In addition to my public statement last night, I checked independently with the parties and, apart from the related detail to which I referred in my reply to Deputy Rabbitte, it was my understanding that there was nothing else outstanding and that everybody was totally satisfied on all other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">It is vital that there is a clear understanding of the point we had reached before the difficulty arose. Early yesterday the British Government announced that elections would be held in Northern Ireland on 26 November. The Government and many on this island, North and South, felt strongly that these elections should have taken place last May. Now that they are going ahead, the people will have their say. What we were seeking to ensure, at all stages, was that they would take place in a positive environment which  would best assure the re-establishment of the Assembly and Executive. Through intensive engagement, an agreement was reached between the UUP and Sinn Fein which suggested the possibility of new hope and confidence for the future. In addition, a major act of decommissioning by the IRA would help to underpin this confidence and trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">We welcomed the engagement between Sinn Féin and the UUP because it offered real prospects that an accommodation could be reached. Therefore, despite the difficulties of yesterday, it is vital these two parties continue their dialogue and the building of confidence between them. I know the other parties felt frustrated by the twists and turns of recent weeks and by their sense of exclusion. However, the goal was to ensure the re-establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive, in which all could then play their part on an inclusive and enduring basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The statement by the leader of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams, yesterday morning, which was endorsed by the IRA, is a defining moment which must not be obscured by what subsequently transpired. My family and political roots are in republican politics and I was nurtured in the republican tradition. Therefore, both personally and as Taoiseach, I am in no doubt about the object and purpose of these statements. The same also applies to the British Government and to Mr. Trimble.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The language used by Mr. Adams yesterday was that of the republican movement but the underlining intention is indisputable and we must consolidate and build on this advance. The Governments had repeatedly made clear what was required to complete the transition to a peaceful and democratic society in Northern Ireland and yesterday's statements represent a recognition of that reality. They state that the republican movement is moving on and, crucially, that the Good Friday Agreement is the framework for full and final closure of the conflict. They state that peaceful and democratic means are the way, the only way, for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Both Governments are satisfied by what we mean by paramilitary violence – we mean the language as spelled out in paragraph 13 of the joint declaration. The mechanism of the independent monitoring body, the draft legislation for which was approved by the Government yesterday, is there to give confidence. The process we are involved in is complex and the clamour for easy one-liners is understandable but not always helpful. I have no doubt that yesterday's statements are intended to usher in a new era for Irish republicans and I acknowledge them clearly as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The announced re-establishment of contact with the IICD by the IRA and the act of decommissioning by the IRA were welcome. As General de Chastelain said, it was larger than the quantity put beyond use in the previous event. It comprised light, medium and heavy ordnance and associated munitions as well as automatic wea pons, explosives and explosive material. We know from the commission that what was decommissioned yesterday was capable of causing death and destruction on a huge scale. In assessing the significance of this act we need to recall that the IRA once said there would never be any decommissioning – not a bullet, not an ounce. Regrettably, the level of detail of the items decommissioned, despite the further details provided at his press conference by General de Chastelain, did not reach what David Trimble felt was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">People may reasonably ask why the IRA insisted that General de Chastelain maintain so much confidentiality about the material being put beyond use, but neither I nor anyone else can answer for or explain the thinking of that organisation. However, its view is likely to be that the absence of confidentiality would damage rather that enhance the process of resolving the arms issue fully within the organisation. I sincerely hope that, in respect of yesterday's act at least, the IRA will revisit its thinking on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">The point might also be reasonably made that, if the two Governments have more detail, they should simply publish what they know. This is something to which the British Prime Minister and I gave some thought yesterday and discussed at length. However, we had to be mindful of the possibility that if the confidentiality which enables General de Chastelain to proceed with his task was lifted by the Governments, it could have the effect of damaging the prospects of fully resolving the arms issue in the longer term. In which case, as I pointed out to Deputy Rabbitte this morning, Mr. Trimble would have had further problems since he would not get any further acts, which would derail that part of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">It is frustrating that while all the elements necessary for success are in place, we have not quite made it simply because there is an opportunity open to us yet to describe what the IRA has done in a way that will fully convince Ulster Unionists of what has been achieved in terms of putting arms beyond use. I am not saying definitively that the Governments are ruling out the possibility that a more descriptive account of what has been happening regarding arms given by them would perhaps solve the problem. However, to have made that decision yesterday, without allowing the IICD the opportunity of seeking resolution directly in its contacts with the IRA, would have been too high a risk to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">I am not going to participate in a recrimination game. Everyone has sensitivities and needs at this vital stage in the process and we must continue our work reasonably to address these. I hope that once this difficulty is addressed we can finish what we started out to do yesterday and, in doing so, ensure the stability of the agreement and the implementation of all the elements of the Governments' joint declaration.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Yesterday we were within an ace of the success we have all been working for. What is important  is that we are still within an ace of success. This House has always adopted a balanced and responsible approach when it comes to discussing the affairs of Northern Ireland and I welcome and appreciate this support.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_200">This morning I expressed the disappointment of every Member of the House and person on the island of Ireland at the failure of the process to reach completion yesterday. The Taoiseach and his colleagues, the British Prime Minister and his colleagues and all the parties which have worked so assiduously for the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, are to be commended for their work but we all feel a sense of frustration and disappointment at what happened yesterday. During Leaders' Questions this morning, we explored some of the central problems which appear to have arisen in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">We do not have the information which the Taoiseach, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have at their disposal as to the nature of the discussions that took place between David Trimble and Gerry Adams, as the two central parties involved at this point in the process, as to what level of agreement, understanding and transparency was understood to be on the table between them. A member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, said on "Morning Ireland" this morning that the Ulster Unionist Party had clearly signalled its core problem had been one of transparency and the level of information in regard to the range of decommissioned weapons. If that was the case a number of months ago, why was it not brought to a finality of understanding between the parties before the process was entered into?</p>
          <p eId="para_202">I respect the Taoiseach's point that things have moved a long way for all parties and, while I would have preferred to have heard yesterday's IRA and Sinn Féin statements many years ago, the Sinn Féin leader clearly stated that full and final closure of the conflict is what is now involved. We are not in the business of recrimination, reprimand or blame and it is important that the Governments do not lose focus on what is to happen. If the electoral process takes place in November with an attitude of mistrust or damaged trust, it will help neither the process itself nor the outcome since it would be an election fought with a sense of bitterness, negativity and a possible disruption of the process itself. That would not be good for democracy or the people of Northern Ireland and would do little to represent the efforts made by politicians from all the pro-Agreement parties in the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I hope the efforts of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister will focus on this central issue. I cannot speak for Mr. Trimble. Therefore, if an inventory detailing the description of heavy, medium and light ordnance and ammunition which has been put beyond use was published this morning, I do not know whether it would be suf ficient for him to accept it as an act of closure – a significant act of decommissioning which would lead us further along in the process of putting all arms beyond use. No reference was made to participation on the Policing Board or the fact that the war is over, which would then be balanced by a statement from the Unionist politicians that they will respect and stand by the continuation of the Northern Ireland Executive and its institutions. That is the central issue on which we must focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">While there is a sense of disappointment in the House, that feeling is palpable on the streets of Northern Ireland. Five years have passed since the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by a large majority, North and South, and this is the be all and end all of the negotiation process. This process is widely recognised and accepted by everyone as the best and only vehicle for the creation of a peaceful future for the people of Northern Ireland. Its provisions for inclusive government hold real potential for it to become a catalyst for genuine reconciliation between the divided communities in Northern Ireland. Governments in this jurisdiction in the past 25 years have all played a role in the putting together of that jigsaw. Fine Gael has always supported the Agreement, offered support to the Government in keeping with our innate sense of patriotism and public duty and set aside party politics to support the efforts of the Government in this critical area.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The time has arrived for real acts of completion. This has been the unfailing message of the two Governments over the past year, particularly from the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair. If the process to achieve this is in place, it is time for real evidence. The defining parameters of completion were clearly set out in the Joint Declaration made by the Governments in April – an end to all paramilitary activity, punishment beatings and racketeering, and a commitment to a process of full decommissioning. In return, the UUP must commit to sustaining the political institutions. The British Government committed itself to a process of security normalisation, the eventual devolution of justice and policing powers and arrangements for those who are "on the run".</p>
          <p eId="para_206">We all agree that the political process in Northern Ireland can only be truly sustainable when trust exists between the parties involved. The Taoiseach rightly referred to the enhanced trust that has emerged between Sinn Féin and the Unionists in recent times and it is vital that although it has been damaged, it is repaired with the assistance of the two Governments. Clear leadership must be displayed by everyone involved because that trust is the cornerstone of any future power sharing arrangement. Once the electoral process is complete, the parties should be in a position to share power and administer government for the people of Northern Ireland. Yesterday's events suggest that while trust has been damaged, the situation is not beyond repair  and both Governments must ensure that the agreements and understandings reached in recent weeks are honoured in full, both in spirit and in letter.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">It is hard to imagine that the intensive dialogue between the UUP and Sinn Féin did not produce a mutual understanding on the need for transparency around the IRA's act of decommissioning. It is now necessary for the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister to establish the nature of the hiatus as quickly as possible. If that does not happen, there is a risk that, despite all the progress made, the problem could cause the situation to unravel. I appeal to all involved to renew their efforts to reach a conclusion about the agreed sequence. There is no need for recrimination that might damage the fragile trust between the parties. Is it only through that trust that people can be brought along and public confidence in the process will be seriously damaged if this vacuum is allowed to develop and we continue to witness a deterioration in relationships between the parties. We remain committed to the Agreement and will help in any way we can. I hope to visit Northern Ireland next week and, in so far as we can offer assistance to the Government's efforts, we will.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The Taoiseach previously identified the need for an announcement on the date of elections by the British Government but I would be cautious about focusing on that. I do not know if Downing Street took its eye off the ball but it appears that there was a lack of communication about the level of transparency required. I do not know what contact took place between Mr. Adams and the representative of the IRA, or if the president of Sinn Féin was able to convince that person that, despite the setting down in legislation of the confidentiality procedure surrounding decommissioning, there could be further flexibility to allow for an inventory of decommissioned weapons. Deputy Rabbitte pointed out that Prime Minister Blair stated that if people knew what he knows, they would be happy. If there is a legal restriction in the sense of decommissioning being a statutory process, the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister could look at that and the problem could be sorted out.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">If that is the case, Sinn Féin can influence the representative of the IRA, which has imposed this restriction of confidentiality on General de Chastelain. Mr. Trimble, from the Unionist perspective, would have to say if the decommissioning is satisfactory. Then the process would be back on track, allowing an election to be fought on a positive basis. It is a question of judgment for both Governments to decide if the elections can take place with the future of the process guaranteed. Otherwise, there will be a destructive election that will result in the worst of all worlds after a negative campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I hope that the Taoiseach will focus on this central issue and that the Unionists and Sinn Féin will work on the level of transparency. If the IRA  representative can state what has taken place, this problem can be sorted out. There are other obstacles and difficulties, such as joining the Policing Board, complete decommissioning, an end to racketeering, punishment beatings and information gathering. If we agree about the acts of completion, these issues can also be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">There is a great deal of frustration among members of the SDLP, to which the Taoiseach referred. While they are not central to the business of decommissioning, they have been central to the whole issue of policing and bringing it to the forefront of the agenda. Obviously, one cannot have normalisation of life in Northern Ireland unless there is a police force and policing board acceptable to all communities and which is seen to be trusted by all communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I understand when the Taoiseach says we cannot have all of the parties involved in all of the discussions if the issues discussed are not relevant to all of them. I also understand it would be better to have all of them around the table and much easier to make progress across the board. In that sense, while the Taoiseach did not have the opportunity to say his piece at the press conference in Hillsborough, I hope, for all our sakes, as people and politicians, that both Governments can focus on these central problems and that they will work with the parties involved in a spirit of reconciliation and non-recrimination in order that this process can be put back on track. This would ensure the elections would take place with a positive attitude and the electorate of Northern Ireland could make their decisions on the candidates from the various parties.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_213">This debate ought to have marked a significant step forward in the peace process. Instead, the best we can say is that it is premature. It is to be hoped that in the near future we can report substantial progress, to which the Labour Party will contribute, in any way it can. It would be easy on a day like this to recriminate, as Deputy Kenny said. There are questions we must ask about a process so heavily described as "choreography" but in which clearly only some of the dancers knew their steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">We are one day away from the tenth anniversary of the Shankill Road massacre. On 23 October 1993 an IRA member, Thomas Begley, carried a bomb into the fish shop of John Frizell on the Shankill Road. Moments later the bomb exploded, killing Begley and nine others instantly. That massacre was preceded a few months earlier by the Warrington bomb and followed within days by the Greysteel massacre. Those three events together marked a major turning point in the Northern Ireland conflict. The depth of revulsion and shock, the fact that every community on both islands was directly and immediately affected by the pain and loss involved, and the fact that they all happened in the middle of, what were then, the relatively tentative beginnings of a process that was to lead to the Downing Street Declaration, the Framework  Document and, ultimately, the Good Friday Agreement ensured that, in all their horror, they were three of the events that galvanised the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">In remembering the tenth anniversary of the Shankill Road bombing on a day like this, two thoughts immediately spring to mind. The first is that we have come a long way. The problems we are discussing, deep and intractable as they may be, are now political, discussed in a political environment. It would have been unthinkable in the aftermath of the Shankill Road bombing to imagine that the leader of unionism and the leader of republicanism would be arranging to meet to try to find a way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">The second thought that occurs, ten years later, is that we have been waiting a long time. The transition from armed conflict to political disagreement has happened but it has yet to progress to the point where solid and well-founded political agreements can be put in place and sustained. This remains a process where there is far too much secrecy, exclusivity and distrust. It remains a process where one player – in this case the anonymous interlocutors of the IRA referred to by the Taoiseach this morning – can dictate the pace of progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Yesterday, we were expecting to be told what Martin McGuinness said on radio this morning, that he had already seen the contents of a detailed statement by David Trimble. We know that the contents of that statement were not only made known to Sinn Féin but that it was standing ready to welcome it. We can infer, therefore, that David Trimble was ready to announce that in the aftermath of an election, he would work with other parties, including the republican movement, to re-establish and sustain democratic institutions in Northern Ireland. That statement would, presumably, have been seen as ground-breaking in the same way as Gerry Adams's commitment to wholly peaceful means. The IRA's endorsement of that commitment was welcomed earlier in the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">We were also waiting for detailed statements from the British and Irish Governments. It is reasonable to infer that those statements would have brought the devolution of policing and the full participation of all of the parties in the management and control of policing to the newly re-established institutions in Northern Ireland a good deal closer. That too would have represented significant progress, and been widely welcomed as a further buttressing of the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The pause button pressed by David Trimble prevented us from hearing those announcements, at least for now. The task facing us is to find a legitimate way of releasing the button. However, at least some of the parties involved know what the rest of us do not. They know the prizes and the risks because they have been involved in negotiating the terms. I have already asked the Taoiseach in the House this morning about the wisdom of excluding some of the parties from the  process of negotiation and discussion. If I have a significant criticism of the process of negotiation, as managed by the two Governments that has brought us to this point, it relates to that exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">The last time negotiations were conducted on a basis that included some and excluded others, the result was the Anglo-Irish Agreement 1985. The effects of excluding unionism from the negotiations were felt for years. The negotiations on the Downing Street Declaration, although technically a negotiation between the two Governments, were conducted on a basis that allowed every party in Northern Ireland to make a contribution. The negotiations on the Good Friday Agreement were as inclusive as possible, despite all of the difficulties of personality, theatrics and melodrama that involved. The result has been sustained progress, despite all of the difficulties. We only have to reflect on the fact that this past summer has been one of the most peaceful in the recent history of Northern Ireland, in spite of the political vacuum, to realise the hunger for peace and progress that is still a feature of daily life throughout all of the former trouble spots. All of the parties in Northern Ireland have contributed to this – the SDLP on one side, the PUP on the other. The Alliance Party and the Women's Coalition have displayed courage and imagination in participating and contributing to the resolution of problems. Their continued exclusion from this stage of the process is damaging and unnecessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The SDLP, in particular, has a long and distinguished record, not of just peace-making but peace-building. It numbers among its ranks a number of individuals whose vision has led us to this point and whose ability made a major contribution to the work of the Northern Ireland Executive during its regrettably brief life. If the two Governments had the added benefit of the wisdom and experience of the leadership of the SDLP during the last few months, we might not be at the point of impasse we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">It is all the more striking when the Taoiseach told us this morning of his own frustration in contacting, let alone dealing with, the independent international commission for decommissioning, to the point where he only travelled reluctantly to Northern Ireland yesterday. For someone as experienced in negotiations as the Taoiseach, that was a remarkable admission. We all know that the great majority of the work in these situations is done behind the scenes. Without wishing in any way to minimise the role of the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair, one would expect them to arrive only when there are one or two loose ends to tie up and their primary role would be expressed in validation of the outcome of negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">It is clear that at the 12th hour there has been a major breakdown of communication between those allowed to be involved in the negotiations to the point where one wonders if they are conducted in a common language. The Unionists  demanded transparency while Sinn Féin is on record as saying it wants the IRA to go further than it has in the past in providing for that transparency. Was General de Chastelain made aware of the implications of the discussions between the parties, and the apparent understandings they reached, for his remit? Was he made aware of those implications in sufficient time? When his interlocutors in the IRA refused to release him to any significant degree from his duty of confidentiality, was he in a position to point out to those interlocutors what had been agreed to by Sinn Féin in the negotiations? If not, one has to ask, why not? There has been much debate, and not a little implied criticism, of the way General de Chastelain played his role. Without knowing what that role was, without knowing what General de Chastelain was told about the understandings given to Mr. Trimble by Mr. Adams, I believe any such criticism would have to be regarded as unfair. If there was a breakdown here, it clearly lay in the inability or unwillingness of the IRA to go as far in providing reassurance and in building confidence as Sinn Féin suggested it might.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">Where the issue of confidentiality is concerned, I have already raised in the House the fact that the burden of confidentiality is a qualified one. I am not advocating that confidentiality should be easily breached in such situations as this and I have listened carefully to what the Taoiseach said this morning. However, it is worthwhile placing on the record that there are exceptions that can be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Both the UK and Ireland passed Decommissioning Acts in 1997, with provision for regulations in the South and schemes in the North to be made under the Acts. A decommissioning scheme under the Northern Ireland legislation, and mirroring regulations in this State, came into effect in June 1998. There are almost identical provisions in both arrangements to the effect that the commission must ensure that all information received by it on the decommissioning process is kept confidential and that any records maintained by the commission are kept secure. Disclosure of information received by the commission may occur where disclosure is necessary for reasons of public safety, to confirm the legitimate participation in the decommissioning process by those eligible to do so and to fulfil the commission's duty to report to the two Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">It is clear that the obligation of confidentiality is one that is imposed on the commission rather than the Governments and that the commission is exempted from that obligation in so far as reporting to the two Governments is concerned. The law does not appear to impose any particular obligations on the Governments as to what they do with the information given them by the commission, although there may well be IRA expectations that the information would also remain confidential in their hands. In addition, it may damage the process of ongoing decommissioning  if there were unnecessary disclosure, as the Taoiseach has said.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Against that background, I believe we all share the frustration implicit in the remarks of both the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister when they said that if we, including Mr. Trimble, knew what they had been told by the commission, we would all be satisfied that a significant amount of decommissioning had taken place, and that a significant process was under way. While I am not suggesting that they should go ahead and tell us, I strongly believe that it should be stressed to the IRA, through whatever contacts the Government has, that it has an obligation to substantiate the legitimacy of this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The relatively vague and technical terms used so far, which have done as much to suggest what was not decommissioned as what was, clearly fall far short of what Mr. Trimble and his colleagues believed they were entitled to expect. They also do little to reassure the rest of us that those on the republican side who stress a commitment to exclusively peaceful means have considerable confidence in at least some of their military-minded associates.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The war is over. I am prepared to accept that and I believe most of us in this House are prepared to accept that. It has been ended, in its own terms, by an undefeated army and I am prepared to accept that too. When war is over, a time comes when swords are turned into ploughshares. Until the swords of the IRA are turned into ploughshares and until the rest of us can be reassured that has happened, they will continue to bedevil a peace process that still, despite all the problems, holds out hope of a new spirit and dynamic for the future of all the people of this island.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I share the profound disappointment and frustration of all those who support the Irish peace process and the Good Friday Agreement at yesterday's turn of events on what should have been an historic day for all the right reasons. No one is more disappointed than republicans at what has happened. An agreement was in place. It was understood by all sides and the sequence of statements and events was clearly set out. That sequence was broken by David Trimble.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Let there be no doubt about the enormity of the steps taken by republicans yesterday. Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams asserted in the clearest manner that Sinn Féin's position is one of total and absolute commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means of resolving differences and opposition to the use or threat of force. The IRA endorsed this statement. IRA arms were then put beyond use and the IRA said  it would continue to engage with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">The head of the IICD, John de Chastelain, confirmed this was a substantial action. He made clear that weapons, munitions and explosives had been put beyond use and this was a more substantial act than the previous two such acts by the Irish Republican Army. He said the operation took a number of hours and, very importantly, he reminded us that this was carried out under the schemes agreed by the two Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">An undefeated republican army has put arms beyond use on three occasions under schemes agreed by the Irish and British Governments and under the supervision of an international decommissioning body. This was a huge step for republicans, unprecedented in Irish history and something that would have been inconceivable until very recent times. Against this background there is absolutely no credibility in the claim by David Trimble that this is not enough to build confidence. This claim takes no account of the enormous difficulty and strain the achievement of such an initiative causes within the wider republican constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Political confidence cannot be built without the political will to respond to confidence-building measures. What happened yesterday was a failure of political will on the part of David Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party. This is not about apportioning blame; it is about recognising realities. Too often the Ulster Unionist Party and David Trimble are portrayed not as political agents acting in their own interests with their own strategy, but as helpless victims of events outside of themselves. In this scenario it is republicans who have to make all the concessions and to take all the initiatives. However, that is not what the Good Friday Agreement is about. It requires the political will and the political commitment of all parties and both Governments to bring about change.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The bottom line is that on Tuesday, 21 October, there was an agreement, a clearly agreed sequence of very significant events, in which republicans kept their side of the bargain and then the plug was pulled by David Trimble. His action has plunged us all into a new set of difficulties. Perhaps other party leaders in this House might for once in their political lives consider calling on David Trimble to accept the assurances of the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach regarding the scale of the decommissioning carried out yesterday instead of their all too predictable and solitary focus of blame on republicans.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I commend Sinn Féin's negotiators for their tenacious and principled efforts. I know they will persist, as all of us in Sinn Féin will, in our unstinting work to resolve these grave difficulties and to set the peace process on the path of progress once again. I reaffirm our determination to get beyond all these difficulties and to ensure the realisation of our vision of the future by peaceful and political means.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_239">The frustrating and depressing turn of events yesterday with the stand-off between the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Féin is blamed by David Trimble on a lack of transparency. Opposition parties in the Dáil can probably sympathise with not being kept in the picture given the absence of briefings and consultation from the Government on the peace process recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Green Party requests such a briefing as a pro-Agreement party and part of a movement that is not just organised on both sides of the Border but also on both islands, with MEPs from Ireland and England in the European Parliament, seven members in the Scottish Parliament and representation at local level in Northern Ireland. As a party founded on the principle of non-violence, we still urge the IRA to declare the words: "The war is over". If partial decommissioning is to be credible, it would help if it were accompanied by these words from the IRA. It is in the gift of the IRA to be open in saying what is being decommissioned and we appeal to it to show such openness for the sake of the implementation of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">People ask how the choreography could have come so far with the expectation in place only for it to fall apart at the last minute. Surely this problem was identified earlier and, if so, why was it so carelessly overlooked? The Green Party, South and North and in Britain, will seek to meet other pro-Agreement parties next Thursday when I will lead a delegation to Belfast. Ultimately, patience is required of all the pro-Agreement parties, including the two Governments and the Opposition parties in the Dáil who have been sidelined by the UUP and Sinn Féin negotiations over the summer. In particular, the other pro-Agreement parties in Northern Ireland, including the Green Party, deserve not just credit for their patience but recognition from the electorate on 26 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">It is ironic that the two parties that have been most obstructive to the implementation of the Agreement have gained so much in profile from their squabbles while those most open and generous in their support have been sidelined. This election will be the most crucial in Northern Ireland since the referendum on the Agreement. It is essential that all the pro-Agreement parties recognise the common cause they share and co-operate and co-ordinate their advocacy of the Agreement. This will be difficult, not alone because of the history of conflict but also because of the nature of party politics, but it must be done. There must be no victory for anti-Agreement forces on 26 November.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_243">I thank the Acting Chairman for giving me an opportunity to speak on the current crisis in the Northern peace talks. I am extremely angry at and disappointed by what happened yesterday. As a long-time supporter of the peace process and inclusive dialogue, I felt let down by the UUP and the antics of David Trim ble. He appeared to falter at the final hurdle. I am trying to be measured in my response in case there is movement in the next few days.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I sense some people are playing politics with this major national issue. It should be remembered that this process belongs to the people and not just one person or political group. A deal was agreed under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement and now the bar is being raised again. I appeal to everyone to stop and reflect for a while. The people of the Middle East must think we have a screw loose. They deal with bombs, bullets and slaughter every day, yet they are trying to initiate a peace process. We have had a ceasefire for ten years and three acts of disarmament, yet Mr. Trimble is still not satisfied. Did we not all agree that the arms issue would be left to General John de Chastelain? Now Mr. Trimble is not happy with that. He cannot have it both ways. If he has agreed a package, there should be no welshing on the deal. It is bad politics, lacks common sense and leads to a breakdown of trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I commend the republican movement for its leadership and vision on this process. I know it is probably not trendy or fashionable to say it in this House, but we must all recognise bravery, leadership and vision. I commend the movement's efforts, especially those of our Sinn Féin colleagues in the House. The movement has been to the fore in bringing about a peace process and promoting change on the island. I also thank the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, for their efforts. We have many political disagreements on other issues, but the Taoiseach has my support and best wishes when it comes to the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">How do we resolve the current mess? Mr. Blair must deal with the UUP and act as a guarantor. I disagree with many political parties in the House on where blame lies. Most objectively minded and independent people know where it lies. I do not want to get into the blame game at this stage because it could be damaging, but I urge people to face up to their responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">As a back bench Member, I represent the widespread frustration in nationalist Ireland on this issue. Many people have taken enormous risks in this process and it is not good enough to throw it all back in their faces. It is time we called a spade a spade and let everyone get on with the job. As we try to move on from 30 years of conflict and get on with building a modern, inclusive and democratic Ireland, we should remind ourselves that this is a peace process. It is about equality, justice and accommodating differences in our country. The people demand leadership, risk taking and vision. We almost had that yesterday and many were extremely disappointed that it did not happen. However, everyone must pick themselves up and get on with the job of conflict resolution and move towards a new Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I wish to address two issues: the existence of British guns and loyalist weaponry on the island. Insufficient emphasis has been placed on their  disarmament. The issue of British and loyalist guns must be addressed. I commend the progressive elements within unionism and loyalism that want to take the gun out of Irish politics. We should use the language of straight talking. I know many people from Northern Ireland and they prefer people to be upfront, honest and straight. I believe in Irish unity and independence, but I want to explain to the Unionist population the reason I believe in the teachings of Connolly, Tone and Emmet. No tipping of the cap is involved. I also want to listen to and learn from the opposing view and the Unionist population. That is what this process is about for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I wish the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs well in their efforts. However, I sound a note of caution. The Taoiseach is not George Mitchell. He must represent the views of Irish citizens. His duty is to ensure that the trust built on between Gerry Adams and David Trimble in recent weeks is put back on track. I wish him well in that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_117">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_250">I wish to put the events of yesterday in some perspective. In this way, we can bank the significant progress we have made and identify the remaining obstacles to the full and complete implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The Agreement has proven to be a resilient accord. It should be noted that, with the sole exception of one party, no one has called it into question as the defining social contract governing relations within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between Ireland and Britain. There is not even disagreement about the obligations it imposes on everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The obstacle we encountered yesterday is not the first of its kind and may not be the last, but it is important to recognise what gives the Agreement its resilience. Its strength derives not from the modesty of the demands it makes on parties to it but from the ambitious challenges it presents to them. Its ambitions may have contributed to the difficulties of its implementation. The challenges in creating a new and peaceful Ireland are not shirked but faced head on. However, I believe that is why the Agreement will stay the course, the foundations its lays will be enduring and that it will be seen as one of the defining achievements in Anglo-Irish relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">At its core, the Agreement demands that everyone plays by the same rules, that the only acceptable methods of pursuing one's political objectives are through peace and democracy, that every tradition be respected and that all be treated equally. It seeks no less than the ending of the use of physical force to achieve political objectives and the forging of a new and historic relationship between the traditions on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I welcome, therefore, the statement made yesterday by the leader of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams. His statement, endorsed by the IRA, made a number of key points. He recognised that political parties must be held accountable. He stated  that he was committed to ending physical force republicanism and that: "We are opposed to any use or threat of force for any political purpose". He underlined that the republican strategy, including that of the IRA, was creating a purely peaceful alternative to achieving republican objectives. In a most significant contribution, he stated that the Agreement, democratically endorsed by the people of both states on this island, provides the context for the full and final closure of the conflict. The leader of the UUP, David Trimble, was, therefore, right to recognise and welcome these comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">However, both Governments have been acutely aware that, if we are to establish the necessary confidence, especially on the part of the Unionist community, words must be accompanied by actions. A key part of the approach of both Governments was, therefore, to secure another major act of decommissioning on the part of the IRA so that the Unionist community would understand in word and deed the significance of what was unfolding yesterday. Under the aegis of the IICD, a major act of decommissioning was sanctioned by the IRA and was carried out yesterday. That this was a significant event was clear from the statement issued by the IICD. The quantity of arms was greater than the quantity put beyond use by the second act of decommissioning. This second act was, as reported by the IICD, varied and substantial. In terms of the third act of decommissioning yesterday, General de Chastelain and Mr. Sens reported to both Governments that the arms decommissioned included light, medium and heavy ordnance and associated munitions. In other words, it spanned the range of operational equipment in the possession of the IRA. They went further and stated that what was decommissioned included automatic weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive material.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Within the bounds of the confidentiality entitlements accorded to groups operating under the scheme, General de Chastelain and Mr. Sens gave a clear indication of the range and significance of what was decommissioned. In their public comments afterwards, they carefully amplified this, while respecting the obligation imposed on them by the confidentiality clause of the legislation and regulations governing the operation of the IICD. It is most important to recognise, as Mr. Sens stated, that the weapons decommissioned yesterday, if used, could have caused death and</p>
          <p eId="para_257">destruction on a large scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">I wish to pay tribute to the professionalism and commitment of the members and staff of the IICD and in particular to the contribution made by General de Chastelain and Mr. Sens. It would be inappropriate and unfair to direct any sense of frustration stemming from the presentation and information regarding the decommissioning event towards them. They have faithfully carried out their task under the scheme established in law.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">It should also be noted that the decommissioning carried out yesterday is seen by republicans as a part of a process of putting all arms beyond use. In its first statement yesterday the IRA said that its representative was meeting with the IICD with a view to proceeding with the implementation of a process to put arms beyond use at the earliest opportunity. Despite the significance of the act of decommissioning, the leader of the UUP and his advisers made a decision that the threshold of public confidence had not been met to enable the UUP to make its contribution to the deal emerging yesterday. In the considered view of the Government, therefore, what is required now is to bridge the gap between what was done yesterday as confirmed by the IICD and to communicate this in a way that engenders public confidence. This is not simply a demand by the UUP. In its statement issued on 6 May 2000, the IRA re-engaged with the IICD to begin a process that would completely and verifiably put its arms beyond use. It stated: "We will do it in such a way as to avoid risk to the public and misappropriation by others and ensure maximum public confidence."</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The reality with which we are faced is that the presentation and not the substance of the decommissioning of arms yesterday has not maximised public confidence. I am very conscious of the sensitivity of the arms issue to those republicans who, although committed to peaceful means, respect the tradition of physical force republicanism. The Government recognises the contribution that the republican leadership has made. However, the presentation of decommissioning must surely rank as a secondary consideration compared to the over-riding need to create the degree of public confidence that will facilitate the creation of the second Executive in the wake of the elections scheduled for 26 November next. The whole purpose was to create the most positive context for those elections. The elections have now been called. Our purpose now is to ensure that the atmosphere surrounding them is the most positive possible. We are not there yet and we must address our minds to the matter immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The Government remains committed and focused in seeking to bridge the gap between what has been achieved and the public appreciation of that achievement. It is encouraged in this by the comments made yesterday by the leader of the UUP, Mr. David Trimble, that the issue was one of public perception and confidence. As the Taoiseach made clear repeatedly in the lead-up to yesterday's events, there must be a clear public understanding of both the words and the deeds.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Both Governments will continue to work intensively over the coming days to secure the clarity required to inspire the greatest public confidence; to achieve the full and faithful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement; the ending of paramilitary activity and the establishment of the institutions on a stable and durable basis working  for the peace and prosperity of all who share this island. I ask everyone to commit themselves to that task.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_2">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_263">I wish to share my time with Deputy Dennehy. I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House. People who live on the offshore islands have the same rights as those who live on the mainland. Services which we on the mainland take for granted, such as rail or bus transport or readily available air transport, have not generally been available to people living on the offshore islands, most of which are off the west coast. The depopulation of these islands over the past 50 years has been due in no small way to this lack of easy access to the mainland. Essential services such as medical care and education are much more difficult to deliver to people living on islands. The development of locally based industry has been hampered.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Since the development of air transport such as small commercial aircraft suitable for island hopping, the prospects of a readily accessible mode of transport to and from the islands and mainland has become very feasible. In that regard the outstanding success of Aer Arann is to be commended. From very small and humble beginnings, this airline has developed into a national carrier and recently commenced an international service. Today its aeroplanes connect many of our cities with Dublin. I speak with some knowledge of its excellent service on the Sligo-Dublin route on a regular basis in addition to many other routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">This airline has its origin in flying from the Aran Islands to Galway. Other islands need to have such a facility but before this can come to pass, aerodromes must be in place. This Bill will allow the Minister to evaluate the need for such aerodromes. If the Minister of the day is satisfied that such an air service is necessary, it will allow him or her to initiate the process of providing the relevant facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I am pleased that the Bill also confers on the Minister the same obligations with regard to sea travel. For countless centuries the only method of transport between the islands and the mainland has been by sea. One can only marvel at the strength of character of many generations of islanders who undertook these sea journeys in small currachs. Even today, travelling by sea off the west coast of Ireland in the security and comfort of a modern ferry vessel can be a daunting task. One can only have the height of respect for people who had to make these sea journeys in small, exposed boats in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Some islands are badly in need of new jetties or piers. As in the case of aerodromes, this Bill will allow the Minister to provide these badly needed facilities. The nation has a duty to cherish all its citizens equally. The location of one's home should not be allowed to interfere with that duty. Other countries have successfully overcome the difficulties presented by people living in remote and far-flung places. I cite the example of Australia and the wonderful success of the flying doctor service. The success of this service is based on the principle of using small capacity aircraft in conjunction with the provision of small runways in inaccessible places. There is no reason why an air service based on similar principles cannot be used to open up the offshore islands. Perhaps the trend of falling population and emigration so endemic in these islands will be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">A recent report suggested the provision of three new airstrips at Clifden and Inishbofin in County Galway and Tory Island in County Donegal. It also suggested that a helicopter service should be provided for the Mayo islands of Clare and Inishturk. I hope this Bill will help to progress the ideas contained in this report. I congratulate the Minister on his initiative and commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDennehy" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Mr. Dennehy</from>
          <p eId="para_269">Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire. In particular, I compliment him for, as Deputy Devins said, taking the initiative on this issue. Over the years the Minister has shown total commitment, not just to the area where he lives and has worked for many years but also to the islands. This initiative is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">In many ways islanders have been treated as second-class citizens. Last week I was almost ridiculed when I told somebody that I intended to speak on the Bill. It was said that the Bill is only concerned with transport and what interest did I have in the islands anyway. That is the essence of the approach we have taken to these people over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">For approximately 25 years I earned my living on the island of Haulbowline in the middle of Cork Harbour. Before somebody points out that this island is now linked to the mainland by a bridge, for many years we endured what the islanders are enduring, public transport by bus and then ferry to the island, a trip of some three miles over water. I missed many working days because of bad weather conditions, either storm or fog, and I can empathise with those who face these difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Despite the €30 million price tag for the cleaning up of Haulbowline, if we work on it we can make that island a jewel in the crown for tourism in the south of Ireland. This possibility was apparent to me even when the steelworks were operating there. The one island around the country with a fairly permanent residential figure is next door to it – Spike Island. I have discussed this previously with the Minister. People live there for a different reason, many of them being  more or less a captive audience. These are the two islands with which I am most familiar.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">As Deputy Devins said, the main inhabited islands are off the west coast. In west Cork we have thriving communities on Bere Island and others. The reasons they have survived are due to initiatives shown by individuals. They have not always had the support of Ministers and their Departments. At times that may have been because islands came under the remit of a junior Minister. That has changed and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, has given an impetus to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I have seen the action taken in the past in regard to transport on Valentia Island which is also connected to the mainland. A transport service was begun and Portmagee, Cahirciveen and all the other areas are now linked to Valentia. This was due to the efforts of the wife of the great ex-footballer Mick O'Connell. This lady took the initiative and got a minibus service going. We have since recognised the importance of such transport provision which I pleaded would be replicated around the country in rural areas. We are now doing that. I was chairman of the health board which applied for it to be recognised under the social welfare grouping and advocated that compensation be paid to CIE and others for running a public service. That has happened and it shows that with initiative one can encourage a population and assist them to remain in their place of birth, to which all of the island people are emotionally committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Island life is changing on a practical and commercial level with the ability to work from home. The provision of broadband services is particularly critical. Television is important as a pastime resource. Deputy Devins emphasised the importance of air transport in the context of the islands. All of the above has helped. The price of land on the mainland has highlighted the benefits of owning land on an island. If the playing pitch is levelled some more we will see people returning to live on the islands. Islanders are tough and hardy people, most of them coming from fishing stock. They need the support of all Departments, particularly the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I agree with Deputy Devins that we can reverse the trend and put people back on the islands if the initiative is there and benefits are provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">While I am happy with the contents of the Bill which is a technical one in many respects, I question the need for it. There should be provision for the Minister to bring in an order. There is something wrong when he has to come back to the House on these matters. He should have the power to move on issues like this without having to refer back. No direct financial implications arise from the legislation. I hope it will send a clear message that money could not buy, namely, that we support the right of people to live on the islands and their need for the same facilities and conditions as exist on the mainland. Again, comh ghairdeas chun an Aire. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_277">I welcome the Bill, which is a short one. I appreciate the reason for it, as I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts. It is a housekeeping Bill more than anything else. While I might not always agree with Deputy Dennehy, I concur with his sentiments today. I have a grá for people who live on the islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The Comptroller and Auditor General was not impressed when he examined what took place in regard to ferry travel to the Aran Islands. That is not, however, the purpose of today's business. Irrespective of how we organise it, we have a duty to the people who live on our islands, which are part of our heritage, and this cannot be done cheaply. Although I was far from happy with the contract process for the ferry service, I went to great lengths at that Public Accounts Committee meeting to ensure that the service would continue. It is hard to believe that a company could get an extension of a contract for seven years without going to public tender. Something was evidently wrong as far as that was concerned but that is a matter for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The ferry service is currently subsidised at a cost of €4.2 million and while I wish to see value for money I accept that we should pay a subsidy for this service. We all know what will happen if it is withdrawn. Apart from anything else, it is a significant revenue earner for the tourism sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Though not much more than four miles of my constituency borders the sea, I have always had great time for those who live and work on the islands. It is only fair to point to the massive impositions and penalties with which they have to put up, though I will not go through all of them today. People try to convince me that new technologies such as the Internet mean living on an island is a piece of cake but it is not. There is a surcharge on everything one does on an island. When one tries to build a house, it is twice as expensive as anywhere else due to extra transport and energy costs. In my life and in my political career I have tried to do whatever I can for disadvantaged populations, of which those who live on the islands certainly constitute one. While there are other disadvantaged groups in society, there is a particular disadvantage involved in being a member of an island community. Island communities are part of what we are and the only way we can hope to revitalise them is by improving their living and working conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">To be fair to the Minister, he had a great interest in these matters, even before he took office. That almost goes without saying. Other than its technical aspects which are self-evident to anyone who examines it, I wonder if the Bill would have been considered necessary had it not been for the comments of the Comptroller  and Auditor General. Obviously, it was. I have been around long enough to realise that the provisions made are necessary in the final analysis. I wish to widen the debate, however, to connect it with the ethos informing the Minister's actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Superficially, the ethos is to improve island life by facilitating access and providing better transport services for schoolchildren to give island dwellers the same crack of the whip as people elsewhere. I do not wish to be overly critical but I understood the Minister's intention on receipt of his seal of office was that the work we are seeing in respect of the islands would form part of a wider strategy of regional development in the west. I have known him for a long time and we come from the same background. As far as people who share that background are concerned, he says all the right things but nothing is done. Is it the case, as it appears, that he has no responsibility because his Department cannot touch other Departments which are sovereign? Unless he gets a grip and dictates what happens, the niceties of which he speaks will fall on deaf ears.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">A huge number of things are happening in the west which form a prototype for what the Minister wishes to do in respect of the Aran Islands. The islands should be considered in relation to the western seaboard and the west should be considered in relation to the east coast as the differences in each case are almost the same. The most amazing things are happening this year. An investigation carried out by international consultants, Indecon, a company which has no hand in government or opposition, tells us that NDP road projects on the east coast are funded at a rate of 140% while the rate of funding for projects in the west is as low as 48.7%.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">I will provide the information for the Minister as it was received. Indecon reports that the growing disparity in the amount being spent on the east at the expense of the BMW region is worrying. The report clearly highlights overspending on the roads programme in the eastern region. In 2002 the rate of road investment in the south and eastern regions was 140% compared to rate of only 48.7% in the BMW region.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">The report is factually correct. Neither the Minister nor I had anything to do with it which leaves us out of the equation. I do not have to come to Leinster House to know that what the report states is accurate. I am aware the Minister agrees with me but the Government is doing nothing about it. I saw the fuss on television four or five weeks ago when the new plaza on the M50 was opened by the Minister for Transport. No more than three hours later, the  largest tailback in three months had formed as the traffic allowed through the plaza was blocked further up and down the M50. This suggested to the gurus who are supposed to run the city's traffic system that another lane was needed, despite the fact that such a provision is last on the list of recommendations in the national development plan. I am not an expert on the Dublin Port tunnel but documentary evidence proves that when completed, a great many lorries will be spewed onto the M50. Even before they arrive, we are told we need another lane.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Every time the Minister and I hear this sort of thing, we know it is a case of reacting to the child who cries first. Where is the funding to come from? I have spent a lifetime at this but appear to be getting nowhere. As a Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív has failed to get anywhere so far. Millions of euro must be ring-fenced to be spent on properly evaluated, sound economic projects in the areas for which they are planned, irrespective of what happens anywhere else. Whether another lane is wanted on the M50, a major road or railway through the west should be built. There is no miracle involved in ring-fencing. It had to be done ten years ago or the farmers of the south would have taken up the entire milk quota, though that was, admittedly, a much smaller matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">If western and regional development and the spatial strategy are to mean anything, the projects which are believed to be important must be funded. As far as I can see, not one major road project has been initiated in the BMW region this year. Though bits of projects may have been finalised, there is no comparison with what is happening around Dublin city.</p>

I do not know what the Minister's office is like but those of his colleagues must be packed to the ceiling with designs, plans and documents on future projects. I will not be hypocritical. While I agree with much of what the Minister says, he is delivering very little. That is what the communities are saying as the Government will find out at the local elections next June.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The Minister's heart lies in the provision of a western rail link. As far as the consultants were concerned, it did not even get a look in and they are the ones who matter. I met them as a member of Galway County Council's road transportation committee, on which I sat until one month ago. It made a very strong case for at least a limited experiment on the railway line between Galway and Athlone but it was not even referred to in the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">The payment of a rent supplement is provided for under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. The purpose of a rent supplement is to provide assistance towards the reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. A rent supplement is an income maintenance support and is not intended to address a person's long-term accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">The regulations governing the payment of rent supplement do not prohibit a dependent child in third level education from being considered in the assessment of an application. In determining entitlement to rent supplement, a health board must be satisfied that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need, that the property being rented is suitable to these needs and that a bona fide tenancy exists between the applicant and his or her landlord.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">In considering whether a particular property is suitable to the needs of the applicant, account is taken of the composition of the household, particularly the relationship, age and gender breakdown of the people in question. Changes in household composition can affect the supplement payment. If the size of the household increases there may be a need for larger accommodation which, in turn, may lead to an increase in the amount of supplement payable. On the other hand, if the household numbers decrease, the suitability of the accommodation may need to be reviewed. If grown up children move away from the family home to attend university, the remaining resident or residents may be over accommodated. For example, it would not in normal circumstances be appropriate for a person living on their own to receive rent supplement in respect of a three bedroom house. The legislation governing the payment of rent supplement provides health boards with the scope to deal with any exceptional cases that may arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The circumstances of the applicant and his or her family are taken into account in determining entitlements in individual cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">Is the Minister saying that a child who is attending a third level institution either inside or outside the country will not be taken into consideration by the community welfare officer when assessing a family's application for rent allowance? This is unfair and anti-family. As a mother, the Minister will acknowledge this is wrong. Regardless of whether a child is in third level education abroad or at home, their home is their home. They may be away from Monday to Friday during the school term but they will return home at weekends, and if they are out of the country they will return home for Easter, Christmas and the summer or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Will the Minister agree it is time to change the legislation in order to include for rent supplement students in third level institutions either at home or abroad? As it stands, the legislation is anti-family and wrong. While the Minister did not introduce the legislation, I am asking her to deal with the matter as quickly as possible. She should rush through the Dáil new legislation because the current legislation is wrong, out of date and does not apply in the real world.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">The question relates to a particular case that arose and it is imprudent to discuss a particular circumstance in the House. Perhaps this is an opportunity for the Deputy to congratulate himself on achieving getting one of the girls through university. I appreciate what the Deputy is saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">As I already indicated, rent supplement is a short-term solution. Unfortunately, a number of people are reliant on rent supplement for a considerable length of time. As the Deputy will be aware, people's long-term housing needs are being dealt with. Individual needs are taken into consideration in the case of changing circumstances. The opinion of the board in this instance was that the person was over accommodated but there was a lead-in period of six to eight weeks to facilitate the person to find alternative accommodation, which would be more appropriate to their particular needs. There are circumstances in which children leave home and if they are not permanently resident in the home, the application is not taken into consideration in the normal way. There are exceptional circumstances, however, whereby rent supplement can be made available. The regulation on rent supplement allows a dependent child in third level education to be taken into consideration in the context of the assessment of an application. In this particular case, it was felt by the board that the person was over accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The Deputy will be aware that there are flexibilities within the rent supplement scheme which is administered by the community welfare officers on my behalf. In considering the particular needs of the applicant the relevant accommodation requirement is also taken into consideration.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">I will not refer to the particular case. A Minister cannot stand over legislation whereby  a family member in third level education, whether at home or abroad, is not considered for rent supplement. I ask the Minister to correct this bad legislation. In a recent case a senior appeals officer quoted from the 1994 Act. I ask the Minister to look at that Act and bring legislation to the House quickly in order to resolve the issue. Whether we like it or not, a family member attending a third level institution is still part of the family. This legislation is anti-family. Appeals officers are citing the legislation and saying that these people do not qualify three months after doing the leaving certificate.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">Supplementary welfare payments are a short-term matter. The regulation applies to people three months after sitting the leaving certificate. These people must be taken into consideration in the payment of rent allowance. In the particular circumstances, it was felt that there was an over-accommodation situation. The CWO, and the superintendent of the CWO who administers the rent supplement, were of the opinion that some flexibility was available, if required. In the particular circumstances, however, they were not in a position to avail of it. I do not see changing the legislation as the way forward because the flexibility is available to the CWO.</p>

      <b>Mr. Penrose</b>
      asked the

      if the recent pre-budget submission of CORI has been drawn to her attention; her views on its statement that the income gap between an unemployed person and a person earning ?50,000 a year has widened by ?276 a week over the past six years as a result of Government actions; the steps she is taking to redress this; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [24390/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_306">The pre-budget submission of CORI, together with the other submissions I have received, will be fully considered in the context of the forthcoming 2004 budget. The CORI submission argues that the effect of Government budgetary decisions relating to tax reductions, social welfare increases and other factors has been to increase income inequality in Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">An important goal of Government policy has been to maintain and enhance Ireland's economic competitiveness, thus creating the conditions for the unprecedented levels of economic growth we achieved over that period and the resilience with which the economy is withstanding the current economic slowdown. That economic growth has led to an increase in overall employment of over 40% and a reduction in unemployment to half the EU average by end 2001 and to half the EU average long-term unemployment rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Being in employment is by far the most effective way to secure oneself against the risk of pov erty and social exclusion. Long-term unemployment in particular is very closely associated with social distress, as people who have been jobless for a long time tend to lose the skills and the self-esteem necessary to regain a foothold in the labour market unless appropriate and timely support is provided. This Government introduced a whole range of employment support measures, such as the back to work and the back to education allowance schemes, designed to assist the long-term unemployed, in particular, making the difficult transition back to employment. These, coupled with the economic growth, have reduced significantly what had been a major source of poverty and deprivation in recent decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The price of the rapid economic growth and the Government actions to incentivise and promote this growth is an increase in income gaps between the growing numbers in employment in good quality jobs and in two income households, and those who are unemployed, some of whom are in jobless households. However, while their relative position may have worsened compared to those in employment, their actual position in terms of better living standards has been steadily improving. Consistent poverty, which measures degrees of deprivation among those on low incomes, has fallen by almost two-thirds from 15.1% in 1994 to 5.2% in 2001. The Government is committed to reducing consistent poverty to below 2%, and ideally eliminating it by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">The Government's determination to continue to seek to improve the position of the most vulnerable in our society is reflected in the revised NAPS and again in the recently completed national action plan against poverty and social exclusion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_311">One of the Minister's comments was that the Government introduced the back to work and the back to education schemes. However, when the Government was in a tight corner it did not touch the rich in respect of capital gains tax and so on but slashed the schemes which the Minister said had been introduced to help people. It is a disgrace and an indictment of the country and how it is run that relative poverty has sharply increased. Consistent poverty has dropped and 90,000 children still live in consistent poverty. Some 5,000 children will be born into consistent poverty this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Let us accept that the figures are as stated. Those in relative poverty live on less than 50% of the average industrial wage. Is it not clear that this is the result of the promotion of the individualism policy, the "me" policy as opposed to the "we" policy, and the promotion of community and solidarity for the less well-off? Is that not the result of Government policy and a clear indictment of that policy? If, as she says, CORI has a self-interest in promoting it, will the Minister agree from the plethora of reports available, that the independent agency which advises her has called in its pre-budget submission for an increase of €905 million in social welfare spending? Why  is the independent Combat Poverty Agency calling for that level of social welfare increase? The reason is simple – it would reduce relative poverty by almost 1% and would have a positive knock-on effect on consistent poverty. Therefore, it is clear the Government has failed. For those on the lowest social welfare rate, the budget increase last year was only €6. What has the Minister to say about the report delivered to her today by her own independent agency, the Combat Poverty Agency, which advised her on what to do in the forthcoming budget to tackle poverty, particularly child poverty?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_313">I am glad the Deputy said it was independent advice because often it is criticised for not giving independent advice. I had the opportunity to meet CORI and a number of organisations on Monday week to discuss the budget. Naturally people look at the aspects which they consider should be prioritised in the budget of 2004. The CORI document is specific and relates particularly to those in receipt of €50,000 and takes into consideration its interpretation of the widening gap between rich and poor. It is a matter of measuring and using certain indicators. We use the indicator of consistent poverty, not relative poverty. Under that indicator, as the Deputy rightly said, we have reduced consistent poverty considerably and it is our aim to reduce it to 2% by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">In the context of the CPA report, I agree it has prioritised children and child poverty initiatives which are part of Sustaining Progress. I had the opportunity of meeting the board of the CPA to look at the parameters in which we could fully co-operate in the implementation of many of its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">In the context of the budget and the priorities set, the pre-budget submissions have indicated clearly that there should be a particular emphasis on support for the elderly, carers and those on the lower base line of social welfare payments. Those issues will certainly be taken into consideration in the context of the budget which is being prepared. It is not correct to say that no effort is being made in addressing these issues. I am firmly of the belief that employment, and access to employment, is the greatest <i>modus operandi</i> for dealing with social exclusion, apart from those who, unfortunately, cannot be within the workforce. The Government will continue to pursue and ensure a strong employment policy to address the many concerns raised and, more particularly, to provide access to employment.</p>

      <b>Mr. Crowe</b>
      asked the

      if she will continue with the need for annual means and medical tests for applicants for the disability allowance.
      [24392/03]

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_317">Disability allowance is a social assistance payment made to people whose  employment capacity is substantially restricted because of a disability and whose income falls below certain limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Continuing entitlement to disability allowance is subject to the person satisfying both a means test and the medical eligibility criteria that apply. As with all my Department's schemes there is a review mechanism to ensure that these eligibility conditions continue to be satisfied. This is achieved through a systematic process of selective and periodic reviews of appropriate cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I emphasise that my Department does not review recipients of disability allowance on an annual basis, except in a minority of cases where this is warranted by the particular circumstances of the individual case. For example, the total number of reviews carried out so far this year is about 5,000 whereas there are over 66,000 disability allowance cases in payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">My Department recognises that a considerable number of disability allowance applicants are severely disabled. The operation of the existing systematic review of cases takes account of this factor. In cases of profound or severe disability these recipients are medically assessed at the time of their original claim. Thereafter, they are not subject to any further medical review for the duration of their claim. For example, some 40% of applications awarded in 2003 do not require any further medical review.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Similarly, means reviews are carried out on the basis of the review status accorded to the recipient at the time he or she makes the claim or following means investigation. The vast majority of recipients of disability allowance do not have any means and such cases are not reviewed on a frequent basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">In all cases, following a review of entitlement, whether this relates to means or medical eligibility, the recipients will be informed of the decision and the reasons for it in each case. They are advised of their right of appeal to the social welfare appeals office. Conversely, many reviews that are undertaken result in increases in payments for the person concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I am satisfied that the systematic and selective review process operated by my Department for disability allowance is appropriate and balanced.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_324">The reason for tabling the question was that a number of persons with severe disability contacted me about the Department's system. For example, one person, Peter, who has cerebral palsy found it degrading that the medical practitioner should ask if he was cured since the last time he had been examined. It appears to be a waste of the time of the medical practitioner. Is such a medical test necessary? I do not believe it is. The system needs to be looked at. The Minister said that those with severe disability are not called for a further medical review but the reality is that they are. If I was to bring a number of cases to the Minister perhaps she would look at them. What I am seeking is some kind of passport where, if people have a medical condition which  will be with them for the rest of their life, save a miracle, they should not be degraded by being called for a further medical review. It is also degrading for the medical practitioner. There are other things which those medical practitioners could do if it is a case of keeping them busy.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_325">If there are particular circumstances, I would prefer if they were brought to my personal attention. I would certainly look at them. On the basis of the Deputy's representation and his parliamentary question, I took it upon myself to examine the review and the selectivity of that review. I was happy in looking at the parameters and the numbers that those who were very severely handicapped would not have been called for a medical review. I will ascertain the particular circumstances but in the main that does not happen. I am glad the Deputy has brought it to my attention. I will speak with the relevant officials to ensure such a mishap does not recur. With 66,000 in receipt of an allowance, a situation may arise where someone is called incorrectly. If the Deputy gives me the details of the particular circumstances of his constituent, I will look at the matter personally for him.</p>

      <b>Mr. Ring</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      if she has satisfied herself with the methods used in her Department's estimation of the numbers who would qualify for a pension based on their pre-1953 contributions.
      [24395/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_138">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_327">In May 2000 a special half rate old age (contributory) pension was introduced to enable those with pre-1953 insurance who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions to receive a pension. Those already qualifying for pensions at less than half rate could also benefit from the new scheme. In order to be eligible for the payment, a person needs 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate which can comprise a mixture of pre and post-1953 contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Based on an analysis of pension claims which failed to satisfy the standard conditions and experience of take-up on previous pension measures, it was estimated that some 3,000 persons would qualify for the new pension in 2000 at a full year cost of €8.9 million. The overall claim load, ultimately, was not expected to exceed 5,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">By the end of 2000 over 11,500 applications had been received, of which 3,545 had been awarded pensions. The Department also reviewed 13,500<i>pro rata </i>pension cases receiving less than half rate. Of these, 7,332 were successful in qualifying for the new pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Up to the end of August 2003, a total of 27,562 pre-1953 pensions were awarded. Almost 63% of these pensions are being paid to residents of the United Kingdom and other countries. The cost in  2002, which includes the budget increases, amounted to €113 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Prior to the introduction of this pre-1953 pension in May 2000, there was a considerable level of demand from pensioners, many quite elderly, for some recognition of their pre-1953 contributions. The pension introduced gives limited recognition to these contributions which, it has to be said, did not specifically contain a pension element and is only of benefit to persons old enough to have had contributions prior to 1953.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">One of the difficulties in estimating costs was that the records available to the Department in relation to pre-1953 contributions were not in such a form as to allow for ready estimation of the numbers of contributions. Many of the records in question were incomplete and had to be supplemented by separate information obtained when claims were made. Furthermore, the Department, based on its current databases, did not anticipate the large influx of claims from persons resident abroad. This was greatly influenced by a major campaign by groups working in Irish centres of population in the United Kingdom and the Department's own publicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">It must be acknowledged that the numbers qualifying and the overall cost of this measure have been seriously underestimated. That said, my Department is frequently required to estimate the costs of policy measures and its record in this regard is good, as has been recognised by the Department of Finance. There were particular circumstances in this case which made it highly unusual. As I explained, it related essentially to the lack of adequate data. However, the Department will take on board the specific lessons of this project in estimating the costs of similar proposals in the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_139">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_334">I supported this first-class scheme when introduced and have no problem with it. The people concerned who have paid their dues did not qualify for pensions under the ten year rule. I welcome and support the Government's decision to provide them with a pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">We were told that the scheme would cost €6.7 million in 2000 and after one year €8.9 million. It is now costing €113 million per year. How did the Department get it so wrong? How could it not do the calculation? Can it not add or has something gone wrong? Besides not being able to add, it is now trying to get the money back. For example, when those in receipt of disablement allowance got their books this year, the Department had not included the page providing payment for the last week of the year. That is how it was going to claw back the money. I brought the matter to its attention and I am delighted it will now write to inform the people concerned that they will receive their payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">How did the Department get it so wrong? Last year the Minister stood up at budget time and lectured us. She informed us she had done well and got extra money from the Department of Finance. However, she did not tell us that most of  the money would go abroad. There are more people drawing this money in England and outside the country than inside. The increases the Minister got last year have actually gone abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Comptroller and Auditor General was also concerned. How could the Department not add up or calculate the number who would qualify for the scheme? For the figure to go from €8.9 million to €113 million means it is costing the Department 13 times as much as expected. Is there nobody in the Department who can add? The Department can certainly add when assessing a poor person on the street for social welfare or the person looking for farm assist aid. Will the Minister tell us how it could get it so wrong? Somebody must take responsibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I am glad the Deputy is perfect and that he acknowledges that the people of County Mayo have benefited substantially from the pre-1953 pension. It would be a sorry day if he headed back to the county not having agreed that it was one of the best pension provisions made by my colleague.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I am sure all Deputies have encountered difficulties, on behalf of constituents, when trying to get a continuum from old records. That was one of our greatest difficulties. There was no expectation, wrongly I suppose, that the networking would be as good as it was and that people living abroad would apply for the pension. As the Deputy said, it is their due. They had to travel abroad to find work and we should recognise them in respect of their contributions pre-1953. They account for some 60% of those receiving the pre-1953 pension. They are living in 28 countries. The majority of payments are made to persons living in the United Kingdom. There are over 9,000 people living in Ireland receiving the pension; over 11,000 in the United Kingdom; 1,500 in the United States; 829 in Canada; 865 in Australia, and 61 in South Africa.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_346">An essential aim of current pensions policy is to increase pensions coverage from its current level of over 50% towards the agreed target of 70% of the workforce over 30 years of age. Progress will be reviewed on an ongoing basis. In addition, a report on supplementary pensions coverage is required by legislation by September 2006. Data in relation to PRSA contracts are being submitted to the Pensions Board on a quarterly basis by PRSA providers. The first such quarterly report related to end June 2003. I understand from the Pensions Board that the returns gave a figure of 2,550 PRSA contributors. However, the first PRSA products were only approved in February. The next report, due at the end of this month, will relate to the position at the end of September. While there may be some increase, I do not expect it to be significant as the mandatory employer access to PRSAs came into effect from 15 September. While I understand there is anecdotal evidence from PRSA providers that between 40,000 and 50,000 employers have signed an agreement with a PRSA provider, this will not become clear until returns due at the end of December are available. I will examine closely the data relating to that and subsequent quarters to assess the position and, in particular, the impact of the mandatory employer access requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I am acutely aware that the development of pensions coverage, for a variety of reasons, will be a slow burner. That is the reason the Government is committed to raising awareness among the general public in relation to PRSAs and with regard to pensions issues generally. The two key issues relate to coverage and its quality. This is directly related to the level of contributions made by those in employment and, in the case of employees, their employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">In budget 2003 I provided for an allocation of €500,000 for a national pensions awareness campaign which I asked the Pensions Board to undertake. Since May of this year the Pensions Board has been active in communicating the "pensions message", in particular through the publication of information booklets for both consumers and employers, by spreading the message on local radio and by contributing to the pension supplements produced in the print media in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Last week I formally launched National Pensions Awareness Week, which will concentrate on an advertising campaign designed to target people who are without any pension coverage. I would draw the House's attention to a pensions calculator the size of a credit card that has been produced by the board as part of its "Think about tomorrow today" campaign. This card, copies of which will be sent by the board to all Deputies, is a simple ready reckoner of the level of pension coverage a person can expect at different rates of contributions, made at different ages. The message is simple – the sooner contributions are made the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"><i>Additional information.</i>PRSA and pension providers generally have also been very active and have committed large resources to publicity campaigns, including television and radio advertisements. I am hopeful that the work of the Pensions Board, coupled with the publicity effort of the pension providers, will succeed in raising the profile of pensions among the general public and lead to an increased level of coverage of a quality nature.</p>

          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I assure the Minister the Labour Party strongly supports the effort to widen access to pensions. Will the Minister confirm that employers had to submit a form to her Department in order to get certification to be pension providers? Forms are coming in slowly for that certification, especially from small shops in rural areas where only one or two people are employed. The Minister should try to help those people and not penalise them. Every assistance should be given, especially to those employing one or two people as they are probably the people who most want to participate in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The Minister had €500,000 at her disposal for an information campaign. Why then had the majority of people never heard of PRSAs some two to three weeks before the 15 September deadline? Has any thought been given to why SSIAs, of which there was a huge take-up and which necessitated the expenditure of much more money on a monthly basis, were seen to be much more attractive than PRSAs? The SSIAs give a quicker rate of return while the pensions, obviously, are more of a long-term investment. It has taken years of studies and reports to get the PRSA off the ground and if it does not take off, where will we go from there? I know a three-year review mechanism has been built in. When the SSIAs mature, will there be an incentive to encourage people to invest the returns they might get into the PRSAs, which would be of a longer-term benefit? This is an issue to which the Minister should give some consideration, together with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who sometimes tends to put the cart before the horse.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_353">On the pensions awareness campaign, given that I only have a certain amount of money, I decided it would not be spent specifically on PRSAs and would be a comprehensive pensions awareness campaign. I did not consider it appropriate to replicate what the providers are doing themselves on television, radio and in the print media. I thought I should use my resources better by designating a specific week to target pensions <i>per se</i> and try to use a number of people to convey that message, especially to young people. I have had a number of ongoing discussions with providers and bodies like IBEC with which my Department is in close contact, as is the Pensions Board. We were involved in assessing how best to target those who perhaps are not that interested in pension coverage, such as the small business person to whom the Deputy referred. At the end of the year, when I receive my reports, I will assess the numbers that have signed up. I am relatively happy that in the region of 2,500 employers have already signed on and it is important that we build on that momentum.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I, too, considered the SSIAs and have put together a working group to examine this issue. I agree that if people will have a certain lump sum available to them, it might be better for them to put that towards pension provision rather than a holiday. I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance and his officials.</p>

      [24314/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_357">I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 93 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">In its recently published annual report for 2002, the Combat Poverty Agency addressed the issues of child and family poverty in Ireland. Drawing on published data sources, the agency estimated that some 5.5% of households experience consistent poverty. Consistent poverty is a measure devised by the ESRI to measure basic deprivation. It identifies the proportion of people below a certain income threshold who lack what are considered basic necessities to sustain a minimally adequate standard of living. This measurement greatly assists in identifying the most deprived and ensuring that special attention is given to their needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The reduction and eventual elimination of consistent poverty has been the priority goal of the national anti-poverty strategy since its inception. The progress being made has been documented by the 2001 "Living in Ireland" survey, the results of which will be published in the near future. These confirm that the proportion of people experiencing consistent poverty has almost halved – falling from 9.7% in 1997 to 5.2% in 2001, with the proportion of children dropping even more dramatically, from 15.3% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001. The overall target, as I have said previously, is to reduce the proportion of consistently poor to below 2% by 2007 and, if possible, to eliminate consistent poverty by that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">One of the Government's priorities is to continue to further develop policies that are achieving this progress, which include support for increased employment, improved income support in real terms, especially for children, and improved access to services, such as health, education and training, housing and accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The strategies for the development and implementation of policy in these areas are set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, "Building an Inclusive Society", of February 2002 and the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, NAPS/incl., submitted to the EU Commission in July 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The national action plan incorporates the commitments made in NAPS and in the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. The strategies set out a range of targets in all the relevant policy areas for combating poverty and social exclusion. In addition, specific targets have been established in respect of groups identified as being particularly vulnerable to poverty, such as children and young people, women, older people, people with disabilities, Travellers, migrants and ethnic minorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Future policy development will be largely focused on the agreed special initiatives in Sustaining Progress, eight of which are of direct relevance to combating poverty, including the initiatives on ending child poverty, tackling educational disadvantage, supports for the long-term unemployed and other vulnerable workers, supports for carers, housing and accommodation and migration and inter-culturalism The newly established office for social inclusion in my Department, has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national anti-poverty strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_149">
          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_364">The Combat Poverty Agency submission again repeats that growing inequality will continue to increase and widen further unless social welfare payments are increased proportionately in line with the average industrial wage. The CORI report sets it at 30% of the average industrial wage. In the context of the NAPS review, to which the Minster referred and which set a target of €150 per week in 2002 terms, in order to achieve that and allowing for inflation, by 2007 she would have to ensure that the lowest  social welfare rate was €183. How will the Minister achieve that, considering she only gave a €6 increase in 2003? Is it not the position, as the Combat Poverty agency stated today, that in order to deal with poverty and in particular to focus on child poverty, lone parents, unemployment etc., the payment will have to increase by €12? In order to meet the goal of €183 by 2007 the minimum increase the Minister will need to give this year is €14 per week for those categories. Is that achievable? If it is not, poverty levels will widen and escalate and this time next year we will be back with a CORI report, a Threshold report and a Combat Poverty report, which will rehearse the same statistics.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_365">Under NAPS/incl., I have received much criticism for the fact that I had no new initiatives. The reason was that I wanted to address the initiatives of NAPS in the first place. I am not happy that we have been slow in some areas, not all of them, in addressing the targets set. The Deputies are suggesting it should rise to the CORI target of €183. I have disputed the level with Fr. Healy but it is within the parameters of €176 and €183. However, that is beside the point.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Combat Poverty Agency has identified two areas – children and families – and that is the culmination of many of the pre-budget submissions. The lower baseline of payments will have to be addressed and brought up to a higher level in order to reach the NAPS income and indicators which have been set. It is an opportunity to have a pre-budget discussion and look at priorities which I hope will reflect those. Sustaining Progress aims to bring those on the baseline up and to target children and poverty, not necessarily on the basis of income but on other tangible interests, particularly in education and housing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_367">I am sure the Minister discussed child benefit when she met the board of the Combat Poverty Agency last week. Child benefit was one of the commitments that her Government gave before the last election and it was the first cutback in last year's budget. Every report has shown that if the Government wants to deal with child poverty and family poverty, 99.9% of money given to women for child benefit is spent on children.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">What actions did the combat poverty board say could help families between now and Christmas? The Government must admit that last week's report was a damning indictment of the Minister, her Department and the Government, certainly on the basis that we have so many people on the poverty line. It is shameful after the past ten wonderful years that so many people are still below the poverty line. There are hungry children and the report is damning.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Since the introduction of the euro people on low income have had major difficulty dealing with price increases. Many of these people do not go  on family holidays and are living from day to day. Has the Department undertaken any research on the impact of the euro on the index and the way in which it calculates poverty? Since the introduction of the euro people find it ever more difficult to live and the €6 increase last year was wiped away by increases in local authority charges and prices. Last week what two issues did the Combat Poverty Agency suggest could alleviate the problem of poverty between now and Christmas?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_370">I am not going to advise the Deputy of the discussions I held with the Combat Poverty Agency board as that would break confidence with the board members. We did look at its pre-budget submission to which Deputy Penrose alluded, particularly targeting children and families on lower incomes. It is important that I indicate the parameters and the indicators set by the ESRI for the Department when we look at poverty, for example, someone who had to go without heating during the last year due to lack of money, who experienced debt problems arising from ordinary living expenses, or people who have availed of charity, not having particular types of meals, or went without a substantial meal on one day in the past two weeks. Those are the indicators used in ascertaining consistent poverty and on that basis we set targets within NAPS and the programme for Government. It is obvious that the general thrust of comment, even within my parliamentary party, has been on child poverty. We all agree with the Deputy that child benefit is very useful in addressing child poverty and it will be considered in the context of next year's budget.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_371">Given that consistent poverty went down in the report and relative poverty went up should the Government not give up the pretence that consistent poverty has any value as a measurement? Is there any country against which the Minister can measure levels of Irish consistent poverty? Relative poverty is the internationally recognised and accepted measure of poverty. All poverty is relative. The distance between those on low income and those who are on average income and wealth levels and those who enjoy the most wealth in our society are the real indicators of poverty. Can the Minister ensure that all reports that come from her Department stress that point?</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I will not broach the topic of child benefit and child income until one of my questions is reached later because then I might go into it in greater detail. In general terms the statistical presentation of information by the Department lacks a great deal of honesty. We have a wide disparity between wealth and poverty, one of the worst in the OECD and in the western world and we need to recognise that. I ask the Minister to recognise that we need measures to properly reflect that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_373">I do not agree with the Deputy's insinuation that the Department is not telling the truth with regard to the indicators used. One of the issues in comparisons with the EU is the demography of other countries where the emphasis is on old age pensioners because of the ageing population. Indicators in Europe do not take into consideration many of the additional supports available to people in receipt of a welfare payment, for example, free telephone and other free schemes. Not all of those are taken into consideration in the European context because in many countries those services are not provided so, therefore, it is very difficult to make comparisons between us and other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Some time ago in this House we discussed how we compare with other EU member states as regards the take as a percentage of GDP. Although ours is lower it reflects the demographics of our European counterparts as opposed to our support for those who are less well off. Government policy is to try to reduce the level of consistent poverty to 2% by 2007 and if at all possible to eradicate it on the basis of the NAPS targets, particularly when one looks at the lowest welfare payment being set in 2007 at €150, based on 2002 levels. We can disagree on how we calculate that. We are close as regards the €10, but I disagree that the indicators which I, my Department or the Government use for addressing poverty are untrue in any way. It would be disingenuous of anyone to say that we should not have any poverty in this country when compared with other countries because that is not comparing like with like.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_377">I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 125 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is subject to my general direction and control, is delivered locally on behalf of my Department by community welfare officers as part of the community welfare service operated by the health boards. The community welfare service also has other functions within the health boards' community care programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The overall administrative costs of the community welfare service are met by my Department and the Department of Health and Children in proportion to the amount of time spent admin istering schemes on behalf of the Departments in question. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, virtually all of the community welfare officers' time is spent administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. A smaller proportion, typically 75%, of their time is charged to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in the other health board areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I met with the chief executive officers of the health boards in June 2003 to discuss several issues, including the future of the community welfare service in the context of the health service reform programme. It was agreed that, in the first instance, the issues should be examined by a liaison group at senior management level representing the boards and my Department. In addition, an interdepartmental working group is reviewing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme as part of my Department's series of expenditure reviews. The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">As part of this review a wide consultation process was undertaken which attracted 145 submissions, covering 700 issues and ranging over 18 themes. They came from users of the supplementary welfare allowance service, information providers and other interested parties including the social partners, the health boards and the trade unions representing community welfare officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The desirability or otherwise of transferring the community welfare service in part or wholly to my Department will be assessed in light of the above evaluations. In deciding that issue, my primary objective will be to enhance the service to those who avail of the supports provided in a manner that maximises the effectiveness of the supports and the efficiency with which they are delivered.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_156">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_383">I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there is a great deal of concern among community welfare officers about the proposed change-over. There is a fear that her Department operates at a different philosophical level from that under which they currently operate. Her Department operates on a criteria-based system whereby, if people fit the label allocated to them and meet the criteria, they are given a payment, whereas community welfare officers operate on a needs based assessment. If the need is immediate, it can be met through a flexible, discretionary system which currently operates. Is it not a justifiable fear that, by taking community welfare officers into the Minister's Department, that will not only impose a new system of supervision but will also involve buying into a philosophy which is not theirs and which they feel would compromise the way they have always represented the interests of the disadvantaged in our society?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_384">I do not agree there is a philosophical difference. However, if we are down to  philosophies, we will be doing very well. The CWOs administer a scheme under my Department's legislation and regulations and that reflects the philosophy of the Department, not necessarily that of the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Perhaps I can take this opportunity to quash any fears the CWOs may have with regard to their status. As Deputies are aware, under the changes proposed in the health services, health boards will no longer exist. It was in that context I thought it prudent to consider the future role of CWOs and to evaluate how to achieve best practice. Having regard to the many agencies acting on behalf of different Departments, perhaps they are best streamlined within their own Department. I have set up a study group in this regard and I assure Deputies that when I have been given some direction on the views being expressed, I will meet the representatives of the CWOs to discuss this matter and evaluate the idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The SWA budget is of astronomical proportions in my Department – over €500 million – and its administration has grown and developed without, perhaps, taking account of the new structures which will be established within the health services. However, it is not my intention in any way to change the flexibility which has always applied under the SWA scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">The Minister has answered the question I was about to ask. However, may I ask her to speed up the process? She said she will meet the CWOs when the report is completed. Would it not be wise to meet them now and obtain their views? They are concerned by media reports of reviews and, indeed, I have my own views on reviews and consultants' reports, which appear to be a growth area. As Minister with responsibility for social welfare and a practising politician, I am sure the Minister will agree that in the event of an emergency on a Friday evening, the CWOs make an instant decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I share the views of Deputy Boyle as to the different approaches of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to people's needs. The community welfare officers look at the situation as they find it, rather than the means of the people involved. I compliment them on their quick decisions in situations which I and other Members have experienced many times, including those involving refugees. When a person arrives on one's doorstep seeking accommodation, there is not much point in telephoning the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is already falling behind on its various schemes and will not make instant decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The CWO system has worked and I would like to see it continue as it is, without any change. It is one the few schemes which work. I suggest the Minister should meet the CWO group immediately, hear their views and take them on board. That should take place now, rather than later.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_390">It is not my intention to meet the CWOs at this stage. I have asked the chief executives of the health boards to form a liaison committee with my Department to consider all nuances of the scheme. When I have more base-line information I will take into consideration the position of the CWOs and others who may have a view on this issue. I reiterate my support for CWOs. As a practising politician, I agree that their flexibility reflects the basic nature of the job, as originally established and subsequently developed. As I said, the regulations and flexibilities are set by my Department, on behalf of which the scheme is administered by the CWOs. There has been excellent liaison between the Department and the CWOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">As I indicated in my initial answer, 75% of the work relates mainly to rent supplement, apart from the Eastern Health Board. We have had discussions about the futility of having rent supplement outside of the Department responsible for housing and environmental matters.</p>

I will certainly take the views of the CWOs into consideration. However, all this is being done in the context of the changes which will take place in the Department of Health and Children and the implementation of the new health strategy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_394">I agree with the comments of previous speakers with regard to the concerns of the CWO community, if I may so describe them. The Minister has said she will meet them. The main concern expressed to me by CWOs was that they were being ignored in this regard. Notwithstanding the Minister's statement that, in the initial development of this matter, the social partners, including the unions representing CWOs, have been consulted, they have given a different impression, maintaining that they were not consulted. CWOs appear to anticipate possible change in their position and I am pleased to note the Minister's assurance to the contrary. However, that concern still remains, as Deputy Ring has confirmed from his meeting with those involved. I believe it is essential that a statement be issued to alleviate those concerns. I hope the Minister will meet them before any substantive change is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">It is generally agreed that these people have one of the most difficult jobs in any Department or any area of the public service. It will be very satisfactory from their point of view if the Minister can alleviate their concern by stating that no changes will take place until after meetings with them and their unions at the end of the review.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_396">By way of clarification, there are two things in progress. First, I have an SWA  expenditure review in hands and that will be completed at the end of December. Second, arising from my meeting with the CWOs and a number of proposals from the chief executive officers of the health boards, they have nominated a number of superintendents to represent the boards in evaluating the scheme with my Department officials. There has been no decision to change anything – absolutely none. If there is to be any change, I will speak to all players in this regard, including the CWOs, their unions, the public representatives and perhaps many others.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">It is important to make it clear there has been no decision to transfer CWOs to my Department. However, it is an opportune time to evaluate the whole scheme because that has not been done for a considerable period. As I have already said, the role has changed to the extent that 75% of the work of CWOs now relates to rent supplement, as distinct from their initial function of providing emergency payments and supports.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_164">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_407">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 79, 85, 103, 108, 116, 118, 121 and 276 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. There are more than 21,000 people in receipt of the allowance at a cost of €160 million last year. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test applies, under which the income of the applicant and his or her partner is assessable. This ensures that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Provision has been made in successive budgets for substantial increases in the means disregards. In April 2003, the weekly income disregards increased to €210 for a single carer and to €420 for a couple. The effect of this increase is that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to €24,150, can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple, if they had an income of €39,750, could still qualify for partial carer's allowance, the free schemes and the respite care grant.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">It is estimated that abolition of the means test could cost in the region of €150 million per annum. In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly community care and respite care, it is considered that abolition of the means test would not necessarily constitute the best use of the resources available for the support of carers. I must emphasise that the carer's allowance is an income support payment and not a payment for caring.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">In addition to further improving the means test, I also made provision in budget 2003 for an increase in the weekly rates of payment by €7 to €129.60 for carers aged under 66 and by €10 to €147.80 for carers aged over 66. The annual respite care grant increased by €100 to €735 and to €1,470 for carers who are caring for more than one person.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">In regard to paying carer's allowance concurrently with another social welfare payment, the primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to anyone individual. Of course, persons qualifying for two social welfare payments will always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Earlier this year, I launched a comprehensive study on the future financing of long-term care, carried out by consultants on behalf of my Department. In order to make progress in the area of policy on long-term care, my Department is preparing a consultation document to accompany this study which will aim to focus all interested parties on the specific issues we need to address. These are significant issues including those in relation to benefit designs, cost and financing, which are discussed at length in the report. A consultation process on the financing of long-term care will then take place. It is envisaged that the feedback from this would be the starting point for the commitment in Sustaining Progress to examine the strategic policy, cost and service delivery issues associated with the care of older people. I hope the working group to conduct this examination could be established in the first quarter of 2004. The report examined a number of financing options for long-term care, including social insurance. All the options, including the PRSI model mentioned by the Deputy, will be considered during the consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I should mention that I recently met with the Carers Association at my pre-budget forum. I am aware of the organisation's concerns in regard to carers and have assured them that these will be examined in the context of the forthcoming budget. The development of the range of supports for carers is a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations already in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_415">I thank the Minister for her reply and I note that there have been some efforts to ameliorate the circumstances of carers. There are 100,000 carers, 21,000 of whom receive a payment of some sort, although not all at the maximum level. Is it not a scandal and an indictment of society that people who work 24 hours per day, seven days per week, 52 weeks per year and some of whom are widows, cannot get a respite care grant? Is it not time that the respite care grant be paid regardless of other welfare payments people receive, since it is only a token grant of €750?</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The big problem carers have is the State's failure to recognise the work they do. I know the Minister does not view this as a payment for car ing, but rather an income support. However, the carers would rather if it was. The Minister says it is a bit early to do so but I have always been an advocate of abolishing the means test. If the Government could abolish the means test for medical cards for people over 70 years of age – the richest of whom may be tax exiles – surely it can abolish the means test for the 100,000 or so people who provide care every day of the week and every week of the year, saving the State many millions of euro. The savings are gained because elderly and infirm people are not being placed in institutions and places are not available in any case. Do we know how much we are saving?</p>
          <p eId="para_417">On a cost-benefit analysis, €150 million could be gained through a percentage increase in capital gains tax for the ultra rich and it would be money well spent. It would be the first tangible effort by the Government to redistribute wealth to the people who need it most and should be cared for, namely, the carers who are carrying out the caring work for us all on the cheap.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_418">We have had a number of debates on this issue and I know that the Deputy, as chairperson of the committee, is examining the issue of caring specifically. I value the work which is being done and will seek the committee's views in regard to the financing of long-term care. It is incumbent on us to find some way of paying for it. The idea of home subvention is the best way forward, perhaps with the culmination of the carer's benefit and carer's allowance with the support networks. Anyone who has looked at the cost of care in a health board institution will recognise the massive saving. As the Deputy knows, any survey of people who are being cared for at home shows that they are much happier there and prefer not to go to an institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">As the Deputy indicated, the census indicates that 148,000 people describe themselves as carers. However, when this is broken down on the determinant of full-time care and attention, which is accepted by the Department, the figure is about 20,000 who are in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I agree that the respite care grant has been of great value. It is a recognition of the caring role which people have. It is one of the issues in the House to which many Members are emotionally attached and I can see why since we have all had experience of people who find it difficult. On reflection, one wonders how people have the opportunity and ability to do some of the work which is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The Government is committed in its programme to increase the disregards in order to make more people eligible for carer's allowance. However, there is not full agreement within all the political parties, even my own, that we should remove the income means tests completely, because we have seen that by taking away the means test for other benefits – such as the medi cal card to which the Deputy referred – perhaps it should be a more targeted approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I would like to continue with that targeted approach and hope we will take it upon ourselves to provide for care, given the change in demographics. Through the family forum, I have had the opportunity to travel to most parts of the country and, of all the issues arising, caring is the biggest. As the Deputy pointed out, we will have to examine how we will pay for it, because the day is gone when grandparents are cared for in their home. How we deal with this issue will be a reflection of our society.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_425">I saw Age Action Ireland's brochure today in which there were great photographs of Deputy McManus and the Minister and I wanted to ask the organisation what Fine Gael did for them since there was no Fine Gael Member represented. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, gave a commitment that the means test would be abolished. I am surprised the Minister did not confirm that today.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Benefits derived from medical cards, rent allowance, back to school allowance and so on should be disregarded in respect of people in receipt of carer's allowance. These people are doing a valuable job for society. This is not a payment and it is wrong that one arm of the State gives it while another takes it away. The medical card or back-to-school clothing and footwear payments should not be reckoned as income.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">The Minister should examine this issue in the run-up to the budget because the people concerned do a valuable job. According to census figures, over 150,000 people are looking after others at home. Of the 21,000 in receipt of a payment, only 13,000 receive the full amount. They are saving the State a fortune. The time has come for the Government and society to recognise them, particularly the women who make up 90% of carers, by abolishing the means test. Failing that, the back-to-school clothing and footwear, rent and carer's allowances should not be measured as income by local authorities because it is not income.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">Perhaps the Fine Gael representative did not attend the meeting. I will speak to Age Action Ireland to ensure the Deputy is in the next photograph, even with me, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Carer's allowance is an income support and, as such, is taken into consideration for other schemes, although we will reflect on its being taken into consideration for medical cards and other services. I will examine this area but I am firmly of the view that we must continue with the disregard, from which we should try to support those outside the means parameter in the coming years. It is the Government's view that this is the best way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">We must look, not just at income support but service provision in caring in the home. I have reiterated that the financing of long-term care is a vital issue and the number of parliamentary questions tabled on the matter reflects the interest in it. We will consider the views of the Carer's Association and Care Alliance Ireland. I listened to their concerns and noted their priorities.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_435">Given the Minister's affirmation that carer's allowance is an income support, to what extent will she introduce measures that will properly recognise the need for income support for those providing care? Deputy Cuffe's question highlights that almost 50% of all carers are over 60 years and that many of them are in receipt of a State pension and barred from receiving carers' allowance under current rules. Some 20% are caring for more than one person. There is nothing in the payment of carer's allowance that recognises the additional costs and need for income that arise for those in these situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The Carers Association should be applauded for its pre-budget submission, presented innovatively as a DVD that physically shows the situation for the people concerned. The Government must come up with clear proposals on how these anomalies can be sorted out and ensure that in the next budget carers are taken seriously and the amount they save the public purse every year recognised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_437">Huge changes have been made to the carer's allowance since it was introduced. When it started, the carer had to live in the house. That has since been changed to living within close proximity. We have accepted that people, particularly women, often look after elderly couples, such as grandparents. This has been recognised in the double payment for respite care, another initiative that was seen as invaluable in supporting carers. Carer's benefit is another new initiative in respect of which much consideration has been given to the extension of the benefit beyond 15 months. Progress is being made in achieving an income disregard that will  remove those who now receive payment and increase their payment as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I would like to be able to tell the House that I can do everything but I will look at progressive ways to deal with carers. In the long-term there will have to be a financial input in the development of caring between home subvention and the income supports available to carers. That is a challenge we must all face and the reason I am consulting widely on what should be done in the future.

          <p eId="para_440">I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 21 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Connaughton – the steps taken to ensure the live export of cattle will be safeguarded by ensuring the resting stations for cattle in transit will be maintained across Europe; (2) Deputy Coveney – if the Minister is satisfied that systems are in place within the Air Corps search and rescue service relating to safety equipment and servicing of that equipment and if he can reassure the House that the crews undertaking the task of providing a modern and safe search and rescue service are doing so in a safe and proper working environment; (3) Deputy Naughten – the need for the Minister for Transport to outline his plans to upgrade the service on the Sligo and Westport rail lines in the light of a number of recent safety concerns regarding carriages; (4) Deputy Ring – to ask the Minister to exempt elected representatives from having to pay the fee for third party FOI requests and the reason it was deemed necessary to make charges for FOI requests; (5) Deputy McGinley – the serious deterioration in the standard of search and rescue services in the north-west and the implications for fishermen and mariners in that area; (6) Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin – the need for urgent refurbishment and repairs at Lauragh national school, Killarney, County Kerry; (7) Deputy Burton – the reports at the weekend of up to €4 billion held in offshore accounts in the Isle of Man and the implications of this for the integrity of the taxation system, the compliant PAYE taxpayer and the activities of banks and other financial institutions in facilitating such offshore tax evasion; (8) Deputy Deenihan – the need to carry out a special investigation into the alarmingly high levels of radon gas in the Castleisland and Tralee areas of County Kerry; (9) Deputy Healy – the urgent need for the Minister to approve a staffing allocation of €3.2 million for the South-Eastern Health Board to enable the opening of the new surgical unit at St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel; (10) Deputy Costello – the need for the Minister for Education and  Science to make an order under section 4(1) and (2) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 extending the remit of the Act and the Residential Institutions Redress Board to Protestant residential institutions and other institutions omitted in the original schedule of institutions; (11) Deputy Boyle – the need to bring into place adequate building regulations to prevent the build up of radon gas; (12) Deputy Devins – the withdrawal of container freight services by Iarnród Éireann on the Sligo-Dublin line; (13) Deputy Kehoe – the need for the Minister to clarify his policy on the future status of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and if it is his intention to retain the independence of this body rather than amalgamating BIM with existing statutory organisations; (14) Deputy Eamon Ryan – whether the Minister for Transport can confirm the information provided by the National Roads Authority to a Dáil committee on 21 October that the design of the Luas at the Red Cow roundabout will have no effect on the traffic flows at the roundabout; whether the Minister will reconsider the need for an immediate decision on the NRA's proposed upgrade of the Red Cow roundabout given that the perceived problem with the Luas at the junction does not appear to exist; can he confirm if the Dublin Transportation Office has advised his Department, in relation to the Government approved Platform for Change transport plan, that the major public transport projects will have to be in place prior to any investment in upgrading the M50, given a fear that providing additional road space first, would further the development of our city along the motorway, which would make the public transport projects less viable; (15) Deputy Morgan – the necessity for the Minister to address the critical situation at Scoil Uí Mhuirí, Dunleer, County Louth; the unacceptable situation whereby children are suffering unnecessarily as a result of the atrocious conditions at the school which was promised a replacement building 20 years ago; the fact that children and teachers continue to get drenched as they move between classes and are permanently cold because of rotting windows falling out of classrooms and permanent accommodation of only six classrooms; the necessity for the Minister to intervene as a matter of urgency to ensure students at Scoil Uí Mhuirí are provided with a new school building which would allow them full access to their right to education; (16) Deputy Andrews – to ask the Minister to clarify his position in regard to new premises for Monkstown Educate Together national school and reclassify its catchment area as a priority developing area given the acute shortage of land.</p>

        <heading>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Powers and Functions) Bill 2003: Second Stage (Resumed).</heading>
        <summary eId="sum_5">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Ms Cooper-Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_442">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill because it gives me the opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on the fantastic job he is doing in the Department, a view shared by all Members of the House. The contributions he has made to the Gaeltacht, rural areas and islands in the Mayo County Council area exceed anything we have ever received in the past. On many occasions it has been a pleasure for Mayo County Council to be able to contribute to some of the excellent schemes to provide piers, slipways and airstrips for island communities that he has provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I represent County Mayo and there are many offshore islands in the constituency. I will outline the money that the Minister is spending on island communities under the island piers programme of the NDP. The total funding provided for the islands is €55.86 million, a huge amount that recognises those communities as never before. I have had the opportunity to visit many of the islands off the coast of counties Mayo and Galway and their communities are full of praise for the Minister which is richly deserved.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">In County Mayo the Minister has provided funding of €75,000 for slipways at Ballycroy and Gob a Droma on Innishbiggle and the work is almost complete. He made funding of €236,000 available for the provision of a new pier at Clynish which he opened a month ago, even though it facilitates only one family. It is fantastic that the Minister is prepared to recognise the importance of island populations, even those considered small. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs believes in the equality of all people, whether one lives on the mainland or an island community. He is prepared to put his money where his mouth is. It was a fantastic occasion on Clynish Island when he came to open the new pier, which has made a difference to the lives of the inhabitants. The Minister has also provided €2.9 million for a cable car on Inisbiggle, which for some time has been a matter for debate in this House among the County Mayo Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">A Deputy referred earlier to people travelling to and from islands in open boats. It is still a feature in many parts off the County Mayo coasts where school-going children travel in open boats from and to the islands. The Minister has recognised that this is dangerous and has provided €2.9 million to sort out this problem. Though it is currently under judicial review, the fact that the commitment exists is complimentary to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">He has also provided for ferry piers at Clare Island and Inisturk costing €10.9 million; a pier on Inislyre at €320,000 and an allocation at Roonagh Pier of €1.94 million. In County Mayo, we  have been major beneficiaries of the commitment of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to the island communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">This Bill is in many ways a technical one. However, one of the purposes is to provide new powers for the provision of connecting bus passenger services as part of certain ferry and air contracts. This is an issue that came up at the Public Accounts Committee recently and is mentioned in the Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General 2001. We must give the necessary powers to the Minister to provide, where it is required, road transport to bring passengers from the landing or departure points on the mainland to the nearest population centres. A good example of this is transporting island children to second level schools. Of the various ferry services subsidised by the Minister's Department, four out of the 14 require such a service. One air service also requires this provision. It is important that the Minister be given these powers to regularise the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">In recognising the major developments that the Minister has carried out on the islands, it is important to bear in mind, particularly for educational and essential medical needs, that island communities need adequate services, whether ferries or air strips. It is important to ensure that these people have all the services that we on the mainland have readily available to us and take for granted. As a member of the Western Health Board, I have noted that the emergency services have occasion to fly helicopters to the islands off the coast of County Mayo. Every facility should be put in place to ensure that the needs of those island communities are met in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The second power dealt with in this Bill is with regard to island air strips. This power will form the legislative framework within which the future development of air transport services to the island can be pursued. This is in the programme for Government to which there is full commitment. It is the Government's stated intention that we will provide air strips, where possible, to ensure that the people of the islands have the equality they deserve. Many of the services we take for granted on the mainland, whether it is employment, education or medical care, require commitment at Government level to ensure these services are available to island communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Pádraig Ó Céidigh of Aer Arann and its wonderful service is an example of the success of providing an air strip on an island. As a result of his fantastic achievement in facilitating travel to and from the islands, he has broadened his company's horizons. I am fortunate that within County Mayo we have the benefit of an Aer Arann public service obligation route between Knock and Dublin Airports. It is wonderful to see that a commitment started at island level can result in a commercial airline moving up to a national context.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">This Bill is all about providing equality, recognising the needs of our island communities and complimenting a Minister who is doing an excel lent job. The Bill will give him the necessary powers to ensure fuller services. I have no difficulty in commending this Bill to the House. It is considered appropriate to provide for the consolidation of existing legislative provisions. Currently, the Minister derives his powers from the Aran Islands Transport Act 1946 and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Act 1998. It is intended to repeal these provisions and consolidate them under the new legislation. This will allow the Minister to operate in a more efficient and effective manner. I welcome the inclusion of these new powers for the Minister. I recognise the commitment of the Minister to the island communities which, so long as he is at the helm in his Department, will continue and even be greater in the years to come.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_452">It might come as a surprise that a Deputy, representing an urban area might want to make a contribution to this debate. I was happy to do so, but now that I have listened to the excellent contribution from my County Mayo colleague, Deputy Cooper-Flynn, I am sensitive that I should not be speaking. In a fine speech, she demonstrated her clear love of island communities and what is being achieved for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">When I first came to the Dáil, like many other Deputies, I had many parochial thoughts about my constituency. I found over the last year that I have established an interest and commitment to many other aspects of parliamentary life. It is good that Members are encouraged to do this. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, who has encouraged Deputies such as myself to take an interest in other communities. Deputy McGinley has also talked to me about County Donegal. I am happy to do so as many of his fellow Donegal men are living in the Dublin South-West constituency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_454">I hope the Deputy is looking after them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_455">I am indeed trying hard to look after them.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I have listened to this debate since last night and have been impressed by the various contributions. Deputy Boyle will be surprised that I praise him, but he made a fine speech in which he drew on the personal experience of his father coming from an island community. However, I did not agree with him when he spoke on what the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is doing. In that regard, I strongly support what my County Mayo colleague has said about the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I had many opportunities over the past year to work with the Minister because of his Department's remit and my work in Tallaght with disadvantaged, drugs awareness and other groups. I have arranged a number of visits by the Minister to the Dublin South-West constituency. He has  met groups in Jobstown, Brookfield, Fettercairn and Killinardin. When he is talking with community groups his love and commitment to the islands comes across in a skilful way. That is important for urban communities because they have their problems and perspectives. I live in the third largest population centre in the State and we have our specific problems and needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">When one listens to the Minister and Deputies from the western counties, we get a real appreciation that we are all doing the same kind of community work. Whether we are representing rural areas, the islands or major population centres, while the actions may be different, the bottom line is always the same – looking after communities. We have an enormous amount to gain and share with each other. Those of us who do not have the privilege of representing counties directly affected by this Bill appreciate this. This legislation also gives an opportunity to praise what the Minister and the Department are doing in this area. There may even be envy at what has been done in that regard. As has just been said, I note that the Department, in consultation with those living on the islands, is working on a five year plan for the development of the islands. This reiterates the point I made about the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Many projects are planned for the period 2003 to 2008. When we come to celebrate taking up the Presidency of the European Union in 70 days, we will have an opportunity to focus on all of the various issues of concern to us. I note the Minister is stressing what will be done as part of Ireland's Presidency. Ireland will organise a special conference for delegates from existing member states and applicant states in County Galway in May 2004. I am told that the economic and social needs of EU islands, particularly in the context of EU structures and funding after 2006, will be a central theme of this major conference. I welcome this and look forward to hearing many good stories about it. It is important that we support this kind of initiative and let the Minister know it represents good use of our national resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The purpose of the Bill is threefold: to provide new powers in the provision of connecting bus passenger services as part of certain ferry and air contracts; to provide for new powers concerning airstrips on the islands; and to consolidate the existing legislative powers of the Minister in the provision of transport to the islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Deputies from Dublin, including me, and other urban areas often raise issues about facilities, infrastructure and services. We will always highlight the needs of our own constituencies and communities when doing so, which is acceptable. Those of us living in Tallaght have often complained about the lack of progress in providing facilities. However, thank God, Tallaght is a different place from what it was when The Square opened 13 years ago this month. We now have many of the facilities that would be expected in a major population centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">While I have occasionally seen it, I can only imagine what it is like in certain communities, particularly island communities where, as Deputy Cooper-Flynn said, the challenges are different. That is not to say those of us living in urban areas do not have challenges – we do. We still have needs and will still be banging on the Minister's door. People should be encouraged to visit the islands more frequently. They are very much part of our communities as the Minister would want us to say. I only have a notion of what it must be like in good and bad weather to be struggling, not only with the normal demands of life but also with the deficiencies in the infrastructure that the Minister is now trying to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">All Members of the House should support what the Minister is trying to do. While he should not take his eye off the ball as far as the issues that are of concern to me in Tallaght and elsewhere are concerned, I strongly support what he is trying to achieve on the islands. Proper connections for transport, proper use of airstrips and all the matters mentioned are taken very much for granted in urban areas. It is important to understand that there are parts of our country that still need to be modernised in this regard. Those living on the islands may or may not want me to use these terms. It should be clear from the debate in the House that we want to support the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">While there might be surprise that someone from Tallaght would want to contribute to this debate, it is important that we can see Ireland as a bigger place than simply our own communities. There is strong support for what the Minister is trying to achieve in this regard. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, will mention this to the Minister. I hope the remainder of the debate on the Bill will be in that positive vein, whatever about the little political differences we might have. It is generally recognised that the Minister is doing a superb job and I wish him well. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_465">Ba mhaith liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, Bille gairid agus teoranta atá ann ach tá sé riachtanach mar sin féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Tá trí phríomh rud ins an mBille seo. An chéad cheann, deontais a chur ar fáil do sheirbhís farantóireachta go dtí na hoileáin, rud atá íontach tábhachtach ar fad. Tá suim ar leith agam ins an dara rud agus beidh mé ag tagairt dó níos maille. Is é sin, seirbhís cheart a cur ar fáil idir an chalafort ar an tír mhór agus na bailte mór-thimpeall. Tá sin ag tarlú i bpairteanna áirithe ins an tír ach, chomh fada agus is eol dom, níl sé ag tarlú ins na hoileáin a bhfuil aithne agam orthu amach ó chósta Dhún na nGall. An tríú rud atá ins an mBille ná aer sheirbhís a chur ar fáil dos na hoileáin. Tá dul chun cinn maith go leor déanta air sin ar chuid des na hoileáin ar chósta thiar na hÉireann ach níl an dul chun cinn sin le feiceáil go fóill ar na hoileáin ó thuaidh a bhfuil aithne agam orthu agus a bhfuil suim agam iontu. Mar sin féin tá rudaí praiticiúla á mholadh ins an mBille seo agus  sin an fáth go mbeimid ag tabhairt tacaíochta don mBille, mar a dúirt urlabhraí Fhine Gael aréir.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Cuireann sé áthas agus gliondar orm go bhfuil daoine – ní hamháin an tAire, an tAire Stáit agus daoine cosúl leis an Teachta O'Shea – ach daoine as cathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus as pairteanna eile den tír sásta labhairt ar an ábhar seo agus tacaíocht a thabhairt don méid atá á dhéanamh ar son na n-oileán.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Tá pairt thábhachtach dár n-oidhreacht le fáil ar na hoileáin. Ní dhéanaimid an freastal ar na hoileáin agus a ba chóir duinn a dhéanamh. Aontaíonn gach duine anois gur chóir go mbeadh an caighdeán maireachtála céanna le fáil ar na hoileáin agus atá le fáil ar an mór-thír agus go bhfuil na seirbhísí céanna dlite agus tuilte ag muintir na n-oileán agus atá ar an tír mhór.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Ní mar sin a bhí i gcónaí. Cé go raibh bunoideachas ar fáil ar na hoileáin níor cuireadh seirbhísí iar-bhun oideachais ar fáil iontu ach go dtí le tamall anuas. Cuirim fáilte roimhe sin. Iarraim ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas é sin a chur ar fáil dos na hoileáin go léir ar chósta na tíre chomh fada agus is féidir. Níl fada ó bhí daoine óga ag fágáil na n-oileán gach tráthnóna Domhnaigh agus ag teacht abhaile arís tráthnóna Dé hAoine. Bhí sé sin ag baint an chroí, an spioraid agus an anama as na hoileáin. Ar a laghad, tá dul chun cinn áirithe déanta ansin.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Tá na hoileáin i dteidil seirbhísí sláinte chomh maith agus atá ag daoine ar an tír mhór. Beidh sé íontach deacair é sin a dhéanamh agus níl sé á dhéanamh i láthair na huaire. Táimid ag súil go mbeidh daoine sásta a bheith beo ar na hoileáin, socrú agus clann a thógáil ann ach muna gcuirtear na seirbhísí seo ar fáil ní tharlóidh sé sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Is mór an t-athrú a tháinig ar dhaonra oileáin na hÉireann, fiú amháin ó tháinig mé féin isteach sa Dáil. Tá an daonra ag dul síos ar oileáin na hÉireann. Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le hoileáin Dhún na nGall, ó 1996 go 2002 chuaigh an daonra síos ó 903 go 775. Sin titim de 15% i ndaonra na n-oileán i gcondae amháin. Táim cinnte go bhfuil an rud céanna ag tarlú ar na hoileáin amach ó chósta Mhaigh Eo, na Gaillimhe, Chorcaigh agus Chiarraí. Chomh fada agus atá an daonra ag titim, nílimid ag déanamh an oiread agus ba chóir dúinn ar son na n-oileán. Má leanann sé ar aghaidh, beidh níos mó oileáin bánaithe. Tá go leor bánaithe cheana féin. Tá leath na n-oileán amach ó chosta na tíre bánaithe agus, má tá an daonra ag titim chomh tubaisteach agus mar sin – 15% i gcúig bhliain – caithfear an cheist a chur an bhfuilimid ag tabhairt tacaíochta do na hoileáin agus an bhfuil sé ró-mhall. Is cinnte go bhfuil bearna agus easpa mór in infrastruchtúr na n-oileán agus idir iad agus an tír mór. Sílim go n-aontaíonn gach éinne, is cuma an bhfuil siad sa Rialtas nó sa bhFreasúra, nach raibh an córas rialtais áitiúil a bhí ann go dtí seo in ann an bhearna sin a líonadh agus an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil do na hoileáin a cuireadh ar fáil don tír mór. Caithfear é sin a bheith mar chuspóir againn, seirbhís a chur ar fáil i ngach páirt den tír, is cuma más oileán nó tír mór atá ann.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Chuir mé suim i rud amháin a dúirt an tAire:</p>
          <p eId="para_473">pobail na n-oileán a spreagadh chun eagraíochtaí ionadaíocha a bhunú a oibreoidh le Ranna Rialtais, le háisíneachtaí Stáit agus le húdaráis áitiúla chun bonneagar agus tionscail talmhaíochta, iascaireachta, turasóireachta agus araile na n-oileán a fhorbairt.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Aontaím le sin, ach an dtéann sé fada go leor? Cén fáth nach gcuirtear comhairle ar bun do na hoileáin ar nós comhairle chondae nó comhairle bhaile – UDC? Ní mise an chéad duine a dúirt é seo. Tá sé ráite cheana féin. Ba chóir go mbéadh deis ag oileáin na hÉireann teacht le chéile agus comhairle oileán na hÉireann a chur ar bun le hionadaithe tofa ag gach oileán nó ag cúpla oileán nach bhfuil an daonra ard go leor agus go mbéadh cumhachtaí cuimsitheacha acu maidir leis an méad atá ráite ag an Aire. Más fiú an rud a dhéanamh ar chor ar bith, is fearr é a dhéanamh i gceart agus go hiomlán in áit leath jab a dhéanamh agus nach mbéadh sé sásúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Tarlaíonn sé in áiteanna eile. Chomh fada agus is eol dom, tá comhairle oileán thiar na hAlbain ann a bhfuil ag éirí go maith leis agus atá tofa go daonlathach agus go bhfuil obair mhaith á dhéanamh aige. Mar shampla, deirtear liom ó cuireadh comhairle ar bun do oileáin na hAlbain, go bhfuil banda leathan curtha ar fáil. Aon oileán go bhfuil sráidbhaile ann, tá banda leathan curtha ar fáil agus tá seo an-tábhachtach d'fhorbairt na tuaithe agus tionsclaíochta. Taispeánann sé sin gur féidir leo a bheith i bhfad níos éifeachtaí nuair atá na cumhachtaí acu chun é sin a dhéanamh. Ba chóir go mbéadh sé mar aidhm againn banda leathan a bheith ar gach oileán a bhfuil bunscoil ann. Thabharfadh sé deis tionsclaíocht agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil ar na hoileáin nár éirigh linn a chur ar fáil go dtí seo. Tá céibheanna agus báid farantóireachta á gcur ar fáil ach an laigeacht mhór ar na h-oileáin ná nach bhfuil fostaíocht ar fáil. Dúirt an tAire Stáit gur seo an bealach sa spéir. Ní dhéanann sé difríocht cén áit atá duine suite anois, má tá an banda leathan acu is féidir an obair a dhéanamh. Cén áit a bhéadh sé níos oiriúiní é a chur ar fáil ná ar na hoileáin, áit a bhfuil deacrachtaí móra le dul isteach agus teacht amach? Bá chóir go mbéadh sé sin mar spuaicphointe againn sna blianta amach romhainn go gcuirfí an tseirbhís seo or fáil do na hoileáin ar fad.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Rinne an t-Aire tagairt do CLÁR a chuireann deis airgid agus forbartha ar fáil i gceantair áirithe ar fud na tíre. Cuireann sé iontas mór orm nach bhfuil sé sin ag déanamh freastal ar na hoileáin ar fad. Ceann de na h-oileáin is mó amach ón gcósta i nDún na nGall ná Oileán Thoraidh. Chomh fada agus is eol dom ní thagann sé faoi CLÁR. Deirtear liom an fáth ná nach féidir le háit a bheith i CLÁR muna bhfuil titim de 15% sa daonra. B'fhéidir nár tharla sin sa DED ina bhfuil Toraidh suite, ach is cinnte gur tharla sé san oileán féin. Ba cheart go ndéanfar eisceacht den oileán agus de gach oileán. Ba chóir dóibh  teacht faoi CLÁR fiú muna bhfuil titim sa daonra.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Nuair a bhíonn daoine ag plé le daonra ar oileáin nó ar an tír mór, is minic go ndéantar botún. B'fhéidir nár tharla titim mór ar an daonra i roinnt oileán, ach caithfear idirdhealú a dhéanamh idir eisimirce agus inimirce. Fágann daoine oileáin. Bíonn orthu iad a fhágáil mar níl aon fostaíocht ann dóibh. Ar an dtaobh eile de, tá daoine ag teacht isteach sna hoileáin. B'fhéidir nach léiríonn an pobal ar na hoileáin an stíl mar atá. D'fhéadfadh níos mó de mhuintir na n-oileán é a fhágáil agus daoine eile a theacht isteach ina n-áit, b'fhéidir i dtithe samhraidh nó mar sin. Is ar an bpointe sin ba chóir a dhíriú isteach agus déanamh cinnte an muintir na n-oileán atá ann nó daoine a tháinig isteach.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Tá meas mór againn uilig ar Chomhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann agus ar an obair atá ar siúl acu le blianta anuas. Bíonn cruinnithe rialta acu agus rinneamar go léir freastal ar a gcuid cruinnithe. Tá siad iontach gníomhach ar fud na n-oileán thuas againn féin agus i ndeisceart na tíre. Bhí oifigigh forbartha i gcónaí ag an gcomhdháil a raibh cúram orthu dul amach agus labhairt le na hoileáin agus dul i dteangmháil leo agus plé cad a bhí ag teastáil uathu agus mar sin de. Deirtear liom nach bhfuil sé ar chumas an chomhdhála oifigigh mar sin a fhostú níos mó. Más mar sin atá an scéal, b'fhéidir go dtabharfadh an tAire freagra air sin nuair a bheidh sé ag tabhairt freagra ar an díospóireacht seo agus go gcuirfeadh sé in iúil dúinn an bhfuil sé sin fíor. Más rud é go bhfuil sé, cén fáth gur tharla sé? Cén fáth nach n-athcheapfar oifigigh eile chun ligint don obair thábhachtach seo dul ar aghaidh?</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Tá obair á dhéanamh agus pleananna á gcur i gcrích. Is dóigh gur fearr go mall nó go brách. Is dóigh go bhfuil eolas ag an Aire Stáit agus daoine eile sa Rialtas ar oileán Ghóla. Tá lúcháir orm go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta ann agus go bhfuil áiseanna ar fáil dó le bliain nó dhó anuas. Ba cheann de na hoileáin é a d'fhág daoine le blianta fada. Bhí mé ar an oileán le déanaí. Tá bád farantóireachta ag dul isteach agus amach agus é ag tabhairt cúpla míle duine i mbliana. Cén fáth nach gcuirtear áiseanna ar fáil do na turasóirí a théann isteach go dtí an oileán, fiú áis chomh bunúsach le leithreas poiblí? Nuair a théann 2,000 nó 3,000 duine isteach go dtí an oileán le linn an tsamhraidh, cén fáth nach gcuirtear áiseanna bunúsacha ar fáil ann? B'fhéidir go ndéanfadh an Roinn machnamh ar sin. Tá uisce agus leictreachas curtha ar fáil ach ba chóir dearcadh ar bun-sheirbhísí eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">Rud eile ba mhaith liom go smaoineofear air ná ionad tacaíochta oileáin a chur ar fáil ag na príomh chalafoirt mar Mhachaire Rabhartaigh, Ailt an Chorainn agus bailte eile san iarthar a dhéanann freastal ar Oileán Árainn. Is é sin go mbeadh oifig bheag ag gach calafort a dhéanfadh freastail ar an oileán agus go mbeadh trealamh fís chomhdhála agus cumarsáide ansin. Is minic a thugann coistí gairmoideachais, boird sláinte nó  coistí eile cuairt ar oileáin. Go minic ní bhíonn siad ábalta dul isteach san oileán mar nach bhfuil an fharraige nó an aimsir fóirsteanach. Cén fáth nach bhféadfaí comhdháil a dhéanamh ón oifig ar an chéibh le muintir an oileáin in ionad lá a chur amú? Rud beag é sin a bhfuil samhlaíocht áirithe ag baint leis agus a chuirfeadh go mór le hinfreastruchtúr atá de dhíth ar na hoileáin.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille. Tá súil agam go mbrostóidh an Bille na pleananna le haerstraic a chur ar fáil do Oileán Thoraigh, atá ag fanacht air le tamall maith. Tá córas maith farantóireachta ag an oileán ach sin an chéad chéim eile agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Nuair a thagann na daoine amach as Toraigh nó as Arann Mhór go dtí Ailt an Chorainn nó go dtí Machaire Rabhartaigh bíonn píosa fada le siúl acu go dtí na seirbhísí atá riachtanach agus atá suite ins an Chlochán Liath, i Leitir Ceanainn, i nGaoth Dobhair nó ar an Fhál Carrach. Sílim go bhfuil córas taistil le cur ar fáil ins an iarthar agus go bhfuil deontas á dhíol leis. Cén fáth nach gcuirfí sin ar fáil do mhuintir na n-oileán ó thuaidh?</p>
          <p eId="para_483">Tá mé buíoch duit, a Cheann Comhairle, as deis a thabhairt dom cúpla focal a rá agus na smaointe sin a chur ar aghaidh. Tá súil agam nach ndéanfar neamairt nó neamh aird díobh. Is pairt thábhachtach dár gcultúr agus dár n-oidhreacht na hoileáin. Tá siad leath-bhánaithe i láthair na huaire. Má chuidíonn an Bille le daoine agus le beocht a choinneáil ins na hoileáin is fiú tacaíocht a thabhairt dó.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_484">Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar Bhille an Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta (Cumhachtaí agus Feidhmeanna) 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Is suimiúil an cheist í ceist na n-oileán agus tá saineolas faoi leith ag an Aire ar an gceist. Admhaítear go bhfuil an tAire ag déanamh an-obair do go leor des na hoileáin. Ar ndóigh, tá eisceachtaí ann agus beidh daoine ag gearáin faoi sin. Tá sé deacair gach trá a fhreastal. Is oileánaigh sinn ar fad agus muid inár gcónaí ar oileán na hÉireann. Ní tuigtear é sin go minic agus ní dóigh liom go n-admhaíonn a lán daoine gur oileánaigh iad féin tríd is tríd.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Tá cónaí orm i mBaile Brigín i dtuaisceart Chondae Átha Cliath agus tá oileán in aice le mo bhaile féin. Cuireann sé i gcuimhne dom gur oileanaigh sinn uilig, a bheag nó a mhór. Nuair a thugann duine cuairt ar oileán faigheann sé an-thuiscint ar shaol an oileánaigh. Tá Oileán Reachrainn suite amach ó chósta Ros Eo. Oileán measartha mór é, go mórmór i gcomparáid leis na hoileáin eile in oirthear na hÉireann. Rinne mé turas ann uair amháin. Bhí an t-ádh liom gur bhuail mé leis an Tiarna Revelstoke sular fuair sé bás, mar ba leis an t-oileán. Cé nach bhfuil mórán daoine ina gcónaí ann is cinnte go bhfuil an t-oileán an-luachmhar agus an-shaibhir ó thaobh an dúlra de. Ní beag an rud é sin i gcomhthéacs na hÉireann agus na hEorpa. Tá a fhios ag Teachtaí go bhfuil  na Sceirí agus Inis Mac Neasáin amach ó chósta Átha Cliath freisin.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Chuir mé féin aithne níos mó ar fhadhbanna na n-oileán in iarthar na tíre, ar Oileán Cliara ach go háirithe. Áit í sin a bhfuil pobal beomhar a bhfuil Drisceol mar shloinne ar an gcuid is mó acu. Tá fadhbanna dá chuid féin ag Oileán Cliara. Cuireann an aimsir isteach ar an tseirbhís farantóireachta ann ó am go céile ach níl neart ag an Aire air sin. Áit í Oileán Cliara atá tábhachtach ó thaobh na teanga de freisin. Táim ag súil gur féidir linn an traidisiún sin a neartú agus a chur chun cinn. Chaith mé roinnt blianta ag obair i gcoláiste samhraidh na gcampaí oibre. Ní hamháin go raibh cúrsaí teanga á gcur chun cinn ach bhí cúrsaí pobail á neartú freisin. Tá ceist na teanga, ceist an phobail agus ceist na n-oiléan faoi chúram an Aire. Tá mé ag súil gur dtabharfaidh sé pé tacaíocht is féidir don ghluaiseacht sin mar is eisceacht é Oileán Cliara imeasc na n-oileán toisc go bhfuil cursaí teanga agus cúrsaí pobail measctha le chéile chomh mór sin ag cuairteoirí agus ag muintir na háite féin. Is ann a d'fhoghlaim mé sábhaltacht snámha agus eile agus tá an dea-chuimhne agam ar an áit.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Tá an Blascaod an-luachmhar i saol na tíre. Tá sé go mór i mbéal an phobail ós rud é gur léimear go léir <i>Peig</i> ar scoil, gan trácht ar <i>Fiche Bliain ag Fás </i>agus <i>An t-Oileánach </i>féin. Caithfimid a bheith an-chúramach an Blascaod a choinneáil i seilbh phobal na hÉireann. Is beag gur áit naofa í i mbéaloideas na tíre. Ba cheart duinn aire a thabhairt di dá réir. Tá baint phearsanta agam leis an mBlascaod de bharr gur Flower sloinne mo mháthar agus go bhfuil an Bláithín i mbéal an phobail mar dhuine a rinne staidéar ar bhéaloideas an oileáin agus na háite. Tá an-chion agam ar an oileán dá bharr sin chomh maith. Ní ga dom rud ar bith a rá leis an Aire mar gheall ar Inis Mór, Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr, ach amháin gur bhreá liom a bheith iontu lá ar bith. Mar an gcéana do Acaill agus dos na hoileáin eile amach ó chósta Mhuigheo.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Tá cúrsaí gnó agus fostaíochta luaite ag an Teachta Mac Fhionnlaoich. Ta mé féin den tuairim go bhfuil go leor roghanna againn chomh maith le dúshlán mór. Amach ó chósta Mhuigheo tá scoil seoltóireachta. Déantar an-chuid obair mhaith go deonach ag scoil seoltóireachta Glenans. Thosaigh an scoil sa Fhrainc agus tá sé lonnaithe in Éirinn le blianta fada. Meallann an scoil daoine go dtí na hoileáin agus don cheantar. Caitear go leor airgid sa cheantar de bharr an suim atá ag daoine i gcúrsaí seoltóireachta. Cothaíonn sé fostaíocht, cé gur fostaíocht séasúra atá ann. Cuireann sé íonadh orm go dtéann daoine ann um Nollaig agus go luath san earrach. Ba cheart a leithéid a fhorbairt amach anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Tá deiseanna fostaíochta ann anois nach raibh ann na blianta ó shin de bharr go dtugann an saol nua-theicneolaíochta deiseanna do go leor daoine a bheith fostaithe sa bhaile. Tá go leor deiseanna ag daoine a bheith fostaithe ar oileáin agus a bheith ceangailte le lár-ionad oibre atá cupla céad míle uathu. Cuireann sé íonadh orm agus mé ag  dul abhaile ar an traein go mbíonn daoine ag labhairt liom mar gheall ar a gcuid oibre agus ag rá liom go mbíonn siad ag déanamh scairteanna comhdála ar an bhfón le daoine san Astráil nó i Meiriceá. Is féidir le daoine a bheith ag obair agus is cuma cá bhfuil siad lonnaithe. Tá aerstráicí agus seirbhísí farantóireachta an-thábhachtach, go háirithe ó thaobh cúrsaí leighis de, ach caithfear díriú chomh maith ar an gcumarsáid nua-theicneolaíochta atá bunaithe ar shreanganna seachas ar aerstráicí agus ar sheirbhísí farantóireachta. An bhfuil acmhainní ann chun córais cumarsáide a chur ar fáil mar is gá, go mórmór maidir le cursaí fostaíochta, idir na hoileáin féin agus idir na hoileáin agus an mórthír? Níl freagra na ceiste sin soiléir dom agus ba mhaith liom go bhfreagródh an tAire í.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Molaim na hiarrachtaí atá á dhéanamh chun daoine a mhealladh amach ó na cathracha go dtí áiteanna faoin dtuaith agus go dtí na hoileáin a bhfuil scoileanna agus seirbhísí i mbaol iontu de bharr imirce. Mholfainn Rural Resettlement Ireland dá bhféadfadh an t-eagras sin daoine a mhealladh go dtí na hoileáin, go mórmór dá mbeadh cúrsaí cumarsáide forbartha i dtreo is go bhféadfadh daoine a bheith fostaithe gan an t-oileán a fhágáil. Bhéadh sé sin go maith dos na hoileáin, do shláinte na ndaoine agus dos na leanaí a dtogfaí ar na hoileáin.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Tugann sé sin muid go dtí ceist na scoileanna. Ceann des na deacrachtaí is mó atá ag na hoileáin is ea cá rachadh na leanaí ar scoil nuair atá an bunscoil fágtha acu. Is é an slat tomhais is tábhachtaí ag oileán an féidir clann a thógáil ann agus páistí a gcur ar scoil gan stró. Go minic is é sin croí lár na ceiste ó thaobh cúrsaí pobail ar na hoileáin.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Tá níos mó i gceist ná muintir na n-oileáin. Caithfear smaoineamh ar an dúlra agus ar an tábhacht a bhaineann leis na hoileáin ó thaobh bithéagsúlachta de. Tar éis cruinniú Rio de Janeiro i 1992 shínigh Éire conradh ag gealladh go gcosnóimís bithéagsúlacht agus go ndéanfaimís éagsúlacht an dúlra a fhorbairt. Tá taithí agam ar an gceist sin, go mórmór i mo dháilcheantar féin. Cé gur Reachrainn an t-aon oileán ins a dáilcheantar a bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí ann tá neart oileán eile ann. Dá bharr nach bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí iontu, b'fhéidir, tá tábhacht agus saibhreas dúlra ag baint leo. Meallann siad cuairteoirí go dtí an cheantar agus tá tábhacht idirnáisiúnta acu mar áiteanna sábhailte do héin. Tá an roseate tern, éan atá gann go domhanda, go tiubh ar oileán Rockabill, mar shampla. Ba cheart éagsúlacht an dúlra a aithint mar chuid de shaibhreas na n-oileán. Is féidir Inis Mac Neasáin a fheiceáil ón mórthír agus is minic nach n-aithnítear í mar áit shaibhir ó thaobh dúlra de. Tá an gainnéad, an fhoracha agus an crosán ag brath ar an oileán sin cuid mhór. Tá an fhoracha, an seaga agus an saidhbhéar le fáil ar Oileán Reachrainn agus tá ag éirí go maith leo, in ainneoin go bhfuil daoine ina gcónaí ar an oileán. Tá an t-oileán chomh fairsing sin agus na haill chomh hard san gur féidir leis na héin maireachtáil ann gan baol. Nuair  a thug mé cuairt ar an oileán chonaic mé cé chomh sona sásta agus a bhí na héin ann. Toisc nach raibh taithí acu ar dhaoine a fheiceáil níor aithin siad daoine mar bhagairt agus níor chuir sé isteach nó amach orthu go raibh daoine ag siúl timpeall orthu. Tá Oileán Naomh Phádraig agus Oileán Shennick taobh leis an gcósta sin chomh maith. Tagann an t-ainm Shennick ón bhfocal sionnach. Níl sionnaigh ann a thuilleadh agus sin an fáth go bhfuil na héin chomh sásta sin. Tá géanna, an roilleach agus an pilibín ann chomh maith.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Tuigim cén fáth go bhfuil an tAire ag díriú ar chúrsaí phobail. Mar sin féin, de bharr go bhfuil na héin seo i mbaol agus nach bhfeictear na gnéanna sin ar an mór thír go minic, tá na hoileáin an-thábhachtach mar áiteanna sábhailte dóibh. Cén bhaint atá ag an Aire le hAirí eile atá ag plé leis an gceist seo? Ba cheart go mbeadh comhoibriú mhaith idir an tAire agus an Roinn Comhshaoil, Oidhreachta agus Rialtais Áitiúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Ba mhaith liom soiléiriú cén bhaint atá ag an Aire le hAirí eile, mar shampla, sa Roinn Comhshaoil, atá ag plé leis an cheist sin. Ós rud é gurb eisean an tAire atá freagrach as cúrsaí na n-oileán, táim den tuairim go mba cheart go mbeadh cumarsáid agus comhoibriú maith idir an bheirt acu ó thaobh na ndaoine a bhíonn ag obair ar son Dúchas de agus mar sin de. Ní amháin go bhfuil na héin tábhachtach agus go bhfuil conarthaí sínithe againn mar gheall ar éagsúlacht dúlra, ach ó thaobh na n-oileán féin de, tá sé tábhachtach don turasóireacht gur féidir le muintir na n-oileán rá go bhfuil siad ag tabhairt aire do dhúlra na háite agus gur féidir le turasóirí teacht lena gcuid laethanta saoire a chaitheamh ann, go mórmhór má tá suim acu i gcúrsaí dúlra, mar atá ag an-chuid acu.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Tá suim acu, ní amháin i gcúrsaí dúlra, ach i gcúrsaí teangan freisin. Uaireanta, cuireann sé ionadh orm nach dtuigeann muintir na tíre seo cé chomh mór is atá an tsuim ag muintir tíortha eile i dteangain na hÉireann. Tá taithí acu ar an mBéarla, gan amhras. Ní gá dóibh ach aon raidió a chur ar siúl áit ar bith ar fud an domhain, agus beidh Béarla le cloisint air, ach ní bhíonn an Ghaeilge chomh fairsing sin. Nuair a thagann siad go dtí an tír seo, is maith leo ceisteanna a chur ar dhaoine maidir le conas a deirtear rudaí sa teangain, cad is brí leis na logainmneacha atá thart timpeall orthu, agus cá háit ar cheart dóibh dul chun Gaeilge a chloisint. Sin iad na gnáthcheisteanna a bhíonn ar bheola turasóirí – i measc rudaí eile, gan amhras. Ag an am céanna, áfach, tá ról ag na hoileáin, agus tá deis acu an margadh cultúrtha a fhorbairt don turasóireacht. Tá cúrsaí teangan an-tábhachtach sa chomhthéacs sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Sin an fáth go mbíonn díomá orm anois is aríst. Ní amháin na hoileánaigh ach ar fud na háite, ní bhíonn daoine chomh cúramach sin mar gheall ar an dátheangachas maidir le cinntiú go mbíonn an Ghaeilge in úsáid chomh maith leis an Bhéarla. Níl mé ag caint faoin Ghaeltacht amháin ach faoi na hoileáin nach mbíonn Gaeilge á labhairt orthu,  nó fiú faoi na hoileáin nach bhfuil éinne ina chónaí orthu, ar a dtugann daoine cuairt. Is fiú go mór é bheith cúramach faoi chúrsaí dátheangacha mar sin, mar tá suim faoi leith ag cuairteoirí.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Ag an bpointe seo, ba mhaith liom rá leis an Aire go dtugaim pé tacaíocht ar féidir liom a thabhairt dá chuid oibre ar son na n-oileán, agus guím gach rath ar an mBille.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_499">The purpose of this Bill is to consolidate the existing legislative powers of the Minister on the provision of transport to the islands and to provide for new powers in the provision of airstrips on the islands. It also seeks to make provisions to connect bus services to certain ferry contracts. While I welcome the fact that the legislation will put the public transport structures of the islands on a much sounder footing, I have reservations about the prior conduct of the Government in this regard, to which I will return.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">In addressing transportation to and from the islands, the Bill places particular emphasis on airstrips and aerodromes. This reflects the increasing use by islanders of air transport. The Bill provides that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, acquire by agreement or compulsory purchase order any existing aerodrome or any land for the purpose of the construction, improvement, extension or development of aerodromes and ancillary facilities on the islands or mainland. Power is also provided through the Department of Finance to construct, maintain, restore, repair or improve any such aerodrome and ancillary facilities. These provisions represent a worthwhile and progressive development. It is important to move with the times. Given the rough seas which beset the west coast in the winter months, it is vital to assure islanders of safe transport to the mainland.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Island depopulation is a serious concern, which improved air transport could address by attracting industry and investment to the islands. This must be encouraged and expanded. I remind the Minister that he has an important role to play in securing increased State funding for the transportation structures of the islands in addition to attracting increased investment and enterprise to facilitate job creation. It is important that the islands continue to be vibrant and sustainable communities and islanders must be encouraged to feel a sense of enterprise given the decline in the population of the islands highlighted in the 2002 census. Between 1996 and 2002, the population of the islands declined by 500, which is a considerable number given the low population base of the island communities. The figures point clearly to the need for a coherent effort by the Minister's Department to reverse the trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The legislation before us will play an important role in consolidating transport services to the islands. It is crucial if we are to ensure the long-term viability and survival of our inhabited off-shore islands. The islands have a unique culture  and heritage, which we should as a nation endeavour to preserve. Sadly, the trend of depopulation among island populations is reflected throughout our rural communities, particularly along the west coast. The 2002 census revealed that 18 counties have suffered significant population decline since 1996. It is obvious that this decline is the result of the Government's failure to deliver on its promises to rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Community-based enterprise is critical and it is important that the Minister who has been a great advocate and promoter of rural communities gets Government support for developments in this area. There has been a lack of enterprise, investment and infrastructure. The facts speak for themselves. The Border and midlands regions have suffered an under-spend of €644 million in the national development plan and the IDA is failing to attract large scale investment to areas outside the east coast. The recent Indecon report commissioned by the NRA revealed that only 48.7% of the money which should have been spent to date on the roads programme in the BMW region has been provided while 140% of funding has been provided for projects in the east coast region. The Department is failing people in rural communities. This is not a personal attack on a Minister who has promoted rural development and the provision of planning permission, which are issues of great importance to the survival of small communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">As the chairman of a development company for many years, I know there is a role for economic enterprises in communities. A partnership among enterprise, estate agents and communities can make a huge difference. There is an opportunity to tap into the voluntary spirit in communities. While the Minister may be aware of certain projects that have not been successful, where there is a clear management ethos, tight control of accounting and clear structures to involve funding providers, it is amazing what can be achieved. The State can get very good value when it comes to renewal. It is critical that people can get one-off planning for small enterprises, broadband technology and three-phase current. The roll-out of broadband can improve quality of life and contribute hugely to people's ability to establish facilities in their own offices. Broadband access in the home means people do not have to travel 50 miles to do their work. The potential of modern technology means that no place should be isolated or peripheral. Peripheral areas should be as attractive as hubs especially with air services such as the one provided by Aer Arann.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">I echo some of the concerns expressed by my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd. There were many ambiguities in the past surrounding the subsidisation of public transport to the islands and the awarding of contracts by the Department. I hope the Minister will be able to explain fully to the House these ambiguities. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report of 2001 highlighted many alarming issues. Under tighter manage ment, it will be difficult for the Minister to account for all of them. Where there is growth in service provision, the cost to the State is quite considerable and it is important to get value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I am a little bit confused about the nature of the Bill. If it is a consolidation Bill, why were the existing contract arrangements not applied in the past? The Department has been negligent in its management of the essential service to the Aran Islands. The Aran Islands Transport Act 1946 provides for the maintenance of an efficient shipping service between the city of Galway and the Aran Islands and authorises the payment of subsidies to persons providing such a service. It is apparent from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that the passenger usage of this service in 2001 could not satisfy any possible statutory interpretation of the term "efficient".</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The original contract for the service covered the period from 1992 to August 1997. As an acknowledgement of the considerable investment in the new service required from the operator, the Department agreed to the insertion of a clause in the contract allowing for an extension of the contract for the main shipping service for a further five years after 31 August 1997, provided agreement could be reached between the parties to the contract. It was asked at the time why further Government or Department of Finance approval was not received for the inclusion of this clause into the contract. Was the clause very favourable to the operator? Why was responsibility for this ferry service transferred to the Department of the Taoiseach from the then Department of Transport, Energy and Communications in March 1996? Why did the Department of the Taoiseach seek to conduct a review of subsidised transport services to the Aran Islands in 1997? The five year contract became a ten year agreement. When renegotiating the contract in 1997, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor advised the Department of its concerns about the implications of possible changes to EU tendering procedures and the automatic renewal of this service contract with the operator. Why was the contract for seven years when the previous contract was for just five? Was this contract index-linked? These are several questions referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I am just making the point. Did the Department inform the Department of Finance that it had given the operator an advance payment? There was a huge number of anomalies. Why did the Department overrule the conclusion of the accountants it commissioned to investigate the operator's accounts? How much did the Department spend on commissioning the accountants' services? A huge amount of money was spent in this area. How many civil servants in the Department have special qualifications in the area of marine transport? This was a matter of concern at the time. Does the Department conduct spot-checks of the ferry service and when did it commence a system of regular comparisons between monthly sailing logs and the number of sailings provided for under the terms of the contract? Why did the Department commence this system? Why did it take so long for the Department to introduce this system and has it made any efforts to recoup subsidies paid to the operator where the number of contracted sailings was not provided? There are major concerns to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">On the Aran Islands air service, why did the subsidy paid to the private operator increase from €279,000 in 2001 to €621,000 during the first year of the public service obligation route? This was a considerable increase. Why will the subsidy increase to €745,000 in year two of the public service obligation route? Who will monitor for the Department the costs of the service? These are all concerns with which the Bill should deal. Why are there no independent statistics for air service usage? Is there any requirement on the operator to forward logs of flights undertaken or details of the number of passengers carried? These are all concerns regarding the Aran Islands air service.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Rossaveel ferry service also causes concern. Why did the Department not obtain a record of approval from the Department of Finance after it decided to award the contract to the operator? Why does no signed contract exist in respect of the service provided under the 1998 service agreement? Why does no signed contract exist in respect of the service provided under the 1999-2002 service agreement? Why does the Department not monitor the frequency of the service provided by the operator? There are a lot of unanswered questions relating to the previous arrangement with the operators of the Rossaveal ferry service, the Aran Islands air service and the Doolin ferry service.</p>

This contract was originally awarded in 1992 without opening up the tendering to public competition. I hope the Minister will explain to the House the current position on this contract. The 2001 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General indicates that this contract will run until December 2004. The Comptroller and Auditor General cited the fact that the Department has renewed the contract worth €4.22 million from 1997 to 2002 without conducting an evaluation of the performance of O'Brien Shipping or the use of its service. An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 12 July 2003 indicated that this contract still existed. The article referred to figures given to the Committee of Public Accounts, which indicated that the number of passengers travelling with O'Brien Shipping has collapsed in the past four years.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">These are issues of best practice and financial mismanagement which suggest the Government may not be getting best value for money in regard to subsidies paid for transport to the islands. I am quoting from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. It is a hard hitting report which clearly indicates huge anomalies with Galway and the Aran Islands and the amount of heavy goods transported to the islands and the level of subsidisation. In 2001, the Department spent almost £5.5 million on the islands and €603,000, or £500,000, on subsidising the city of Galway passenger and goods service. Some 10% of the total State expenditure on the islands in 2001 went on a service used for 11,000 one-way passenger journeys in a whole year. The Department is unable  to provide any statistics for the volume of goods shipped to the Aran Islands by the operators in 2001. Perhaps the Minister has the figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_530">I invite the Minister to check the figures and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which will give the facts relating to 2001. It makes shameful reading and it is an embarrassment that any Department could stand over it. I hope the Bill will set the record straight and that any management of the islands will be done on a business-like basis, void of sentiment and that it will provide an essential service.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I call on the Minister to ensure better management of our public transport service to the islands and to work to build upon and expand the infrastructure and transport capabilities to and from the offshore islands. Where there is potential for growth, the investment required should be provided to attract holiday makers to the island. Given the level of depopulation – the census suggests there are 500 fewer people on the islands – I hope the Minister will suggest some incentive, such as a tax break, to encourage more people to live on the islands. It is clear that unless he provides some meaningful benefits that decline will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I would like to think that the growth of the rural communities, of which the Minister is one of the best on that issue, would be tackled but unfortunately the message is not getting through to Cabinet. Despite all the talk there are cutbacks every day for FÁS, job creation and the voluntary input. The voluntary sector has made an heroic contribution, but it has been neglected by the Government in many areas in regard to funding. That is regrettable because that sector has delivered outstanding work in the past. I hope the Minister, through this Bill, will deal with the many deficits relating to the islands. One does not have to go to the islands to find funding deficits. We hear much about the State's spending commitments but there is little action. The crucial test is whether we can encourage people to get  involved in their communities. What they want is a partnership and assistance, not a bureaucratic State and layers of paper filling. They want a simple procedure that is meaningful and taps into that shared commitment of those who give of their time voluntarily.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I hope the Minister will deal with some of the queries I raised on the shambolic system in place in the past with regard to providing an equitable and fair service for the islands. That has not been the case. I sincerely hope the Bill will ensure there are no soft arrangements, loose deals or deals arranged by virtue of an entitlement, which was the case with many operators providing this service.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_536">I will be voting in favour of this Bill which as others have pointed out is not contentious. It makes obvious sense that the Minister with responsibility for the development of the islands ought to have the powers which are being transferred under the legislation. It is also important that the communities concerned are provided with the best possible services and, in particular, with the necessary transport and infrastructure that will lessen whatever disadvantage arises from their remote location.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I note that in his opening remarks, the Minister referred to the 40% of the population of the State who live in rural communities and the tremendous changes that are occurring there due to a variety of social, economic and demographic factors. I also acknowledge his own personal commitment to the development of rural communities and would certainly not wish to take away from any of the achievements to which he refers, be they the establishment of the CLÁR programme or the increase in the number of ferries connecting the islands to the mainland. The connection of these ferries from islands to the mainland is a commendable project and helps those cut off by the elements to have access to the main island.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">However, I contend that the Minister's own commitment and the work of his Department is not being helped by the overall tendency of this Government to cut back on the type of public services upon which rural communities are so dependent. While dedicated programmes aimed at particularly disadvantaged areas bring great benefit to the communities concerned, they ought to be complementary to an overall progressive development strategy and not expected to make up for economic decline and social decay hastened by cuts in areas such as education, transport and other public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The effects of the erosion during the past 20 to 25 years can be seen in the demise of the small farmer, the small shop keeper, Garda barracks in many areas due to decentralisation of that ser vice, rural post offices and many areas which do not have a transport service. That, I am afraid, is the experience of too many rural communities at present. Apart from the direct effects of the decline of public services, there is also the gradual erosion of the economic basis of communities in which farming and fishing are in decline, and where no alternative enterprises are being established, that decline is all the more startling.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">As I am sure the Minister will be aware from his own constituency and others, the level of unemployment in the more isolated rural parts of the State is growing way above the national average. The entire western seaboard from Donegal to Kerry and west Cork has many of the blackspots shown in the recent survey. Certainly in my own county, areas such as Tarbert, Ballyduff, Causeway, Tralee, Listowel, Castleisland – the main centres of population – are running at twice the national average in regard to unemployment. I am sure the Minister will also have noted the re-emergence of particular black spots in his constituency. In County Donegal, which I suppose is the county that probably presents the best example of the types of problems confronting rural parts of the State, unemployment remained well above the national average during the economic upturn that was known as the Celtic tiger, and has reached alarming proportions since that particular beast went into hiding.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I am not reciting these figures to attack the Minister as he is not responsible for the numbers unemployed. I do so merely to reinforce my argument that the good intentions and work being carried out under the auspices of his Department are being undermined by the overall thrust of Government fiscal policy and the economic downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Unemployment affects the more isolated rural areas covered by Teagasc, an advisory board to the farming community. The cutbacks in the community employment and social employment schemes are having a massive effect and are a major contributory factor to the growing problem of unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">I agree that the sort of programmes carried out under the supervision of the Department can play a valuable role in regenerating rural communities, but only if they are carried out in combination with a positive overall approach to the provision of public services and a more aggressive strategy to promote economic growth in rural Ireland, whether in the traditional farming and fishing sectors or in new alternative sources of employment. Many are gaining valuable experience and training through their involvement in programmes like Leader and CLÁR, but they sometimes feel as though their efforts are being undermined by the factors to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The Minister referred to planning, which is another major factor affecting rural Ireland. If we want to sustain a viable population in rural areas, the planning issue must be addressed. It is mindboggling that local people are unable to get plan ning permission to build homes in their local area. We also need a policy to provide for people who live in areas where sites are beyond their means. Perhaps the Government could provide interest free loans in order that young people could purchase sites and live in their communities. Otherwise, it should create a policy to provide affordable sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The Minister referred in his contribution to the Cranfield University study on the provision of air services to the islands, and stated that its recommendations are under review in the Department. I hope this will lead to an increase in the provision of air services to the islands as this will immensely improve the level and quality of communication between the islands and the rest of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">While on the subject of air services, I pass on the concerns forwarded to me by people in County Donegal about the current problems regarding the provision of search and rescue services from Sligo due to a dispute involving winchmen. I trust that the Department of Defence will resolve this as quickly as possible and restore a vital service for the north-west. We do not need to highlight the dangers faced by people involved in the fishing industry on a daily basis. This service is vital to their well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I would like to make some brief points regarding the movement of people from rural to urban areas, and <i>vice versa.</i> The Minister's grandfather has sometimes been criticised for his vision of a rural-based society, but it is one I am sure many would share, at least as an aspiration. It has long been the policy of my party to argue in favour of a radical decentralisation of power and economic activity away from the main urban centres. That means that people should be encouraged to move away from the cities and towns back into rural communities. Far from this being something backward or associated with Maoism, recent developments make such a policy far easier to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Already we are witnessing people moving away from cities like Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway in search of a place to live. However, this is usually done in an unplanned manner with people still commuting back to the cities to work. Would it not make a lot more sense if jobs were relocated? This has been done on a small scale in some Departments but there is greater scope for it. It should be a central part of the IDA's strategy to attract industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">All of this may seem unconnected to the subject of the Bill but I see all attempts to improve the level of services to and communications with more remote rural areas as, potentially, part of a much wider strategy to implement real decentralisation, one in which moving away from the city would not entail any reduction in access to public services, work or other amenities.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">In that spirit, I welcome the Bill as a move towards providing the relevant Department with the power to implement projects to improve the lives of the people in the communities concerned.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_551">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and state my support for our rural and island communities. Although some of us represent urban areas, it is essential that as legislators we work for the ending of any rural-urban divide in our society. I commend and thank rural communities for their massive, social, political, cultural and economic contribution to this island. They have also made major international contributions and it is essential we recognise this today.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Independent Deputies and the members of the Technical Group, in particular, have learned to listen and work together on issues important to people. Recently, a group of Independent Deputies, of which I was a member, visited Pollathomas, County Mayo, where we met the residents affected by the recent landslide. We went to offer support and solidarity following their dreadful tragedy. Listening to their stories in the small local church and talking to them afterwards showed me clearly the need for urban Deputies to keep an eye on the ball with regard to how people live on our coasts and islands. These people have a lot to offer. I admire their courage, integrity and spirit of survival. They are a massive resource to any country.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The people concerned also have a long history of emigration to England, the United States, Canada, Australia and many other places around the world. When they landed in foreign places, they settled and made massive economic, social and political contributions to their new states. That is the reason we should have open hearts and minds when dealing with immigration to our country. We should be mindful of our history. Many immigrants are like those people from our islands and coasts who emigrated. Emigration is buried in our psyche and should not be forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate the existing legislative powers of the Minister in the provision of transport to the islands and to provide for new powers in the provision of airstrips on the islands and of connecting bus passenger services as part of certain ferry-air contracts. I welcome section 2 which provides for the powers of the Minister in the provision of transport services for islands. The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay subsidies for the operation of ferry services, as provided for previously under the Aran Islands Transport Act 1946 and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Act 1998. In addition, without prejudice to the validity of subsidies previously paid in this regard, power is provided, subject to the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport, for payment of subsidies relating to island connecting bus passenger services attaching to certain ferry-air contracts, the destinations of which will be set out in regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Section 3 provides for the powers of the Minister in the provision of aerodromes in connection with the delivery of air services between the islands and the mainland. In this context, the  Minister may, with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport, acquire, by agreement or compulsorily, any existing aerodromes or any land for the purpose of the construction, improvement, extension or development of aerodromes and ancillary facilities on the islands, or as the case may be the mainland. Power is also provided to finance the construction, maintenance, restoration, repair or improvement of any such aerodromes and ancillary facilities. Procedures to be followed in the event that compulsory purchase is required are set out, including standard provisions for prior notice, display of plans, notification to interested parties, public inquiry, compensation, arbitration, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">No direct financial implications arise from the legislation. I welcome the fact that consolidation of previous legislation and regularising of existing contract arrangements will be cost neutral. The provision of new powers in the provision of air access does not carry any financial obligation or direct implication but would form the legislative framework within which the future development of transport services to the islands can be pursued, subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Transport, as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">No staffing implications arise from the legislation. On staffing, it is essential that we deal with the issue of population. We must ensure the islands have good schools, jobs and health care. We cannot allow our citizens to live without services and transport. This is a key element. Air and sea transport are essential parts of island life. The issue of water and boat safety is also important. We have a duty to ensure that the safety and quality of life on the islands is protected. We have seen so many tragedies in the past that could have been avoided, particularly drowning and boating tragedies.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Section 7 provides for the Minister's power regarding the management and operation of such aerodromes or, if authorised by order made by the Minister with the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport, delegation of this function to a statutory body, such as a local authority or a company financed or assisted by the Exchequer. Here again we see the role of the local authority and I feel we have to be in touch with local communities. I have seen examples of good practice but I have also examples of terrible practice on the part of local authorities who are not listening to people on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The local council has got to be proactive, to build and develop the relationship between local people, especially people living on the islands. There is massive scope for development and exploiting potential for the future. Good economic strategies can turn around an island community.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Section 4 provides for the repeal of the Aran Islands Transport Act 1946 and section 4 of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Powers and Functions) Act 1998, without prejudice to previous or existing contracts made  under that legislation. Section 5 provides that the expenses incurred by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister for Transport in the administration shall, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. The expenses of the Minister for Finance will also be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Here again the question of public finances comes to the top of the agenda. Public money should always be spent wisely, especially on the most disadvantaged in our society. I usually talk much about urban disadvantage. We must also face the reality of rural disadvantage, particularly in this Bill. We have a glorious opportunity to do so when dealing with transport services to the islands. Think, for example, of the winter months, the long cold nights and the dangerous seas. We all have a duty to look after our island people. If we are really serious, we will give them a decent transport service and that is the bottom line in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">It is refreshing to see in this debate the number of urban Deputies expressing their support and goodwill for the island communities. Most of that comes from our own experience as visitors or as tourists to these islands. This opens up the whole question of their importance to the tourism industry. If one talks to any of our foreign tourists, research shows the islands and what they have to offer are a major reason for them coming to Ireland. They represent a massive natural and human resource that we often neglect and forget. Our coasts, seas and islands can bring more visitors into the country and this in turn will lead to more jobs and economic investment. As legislators we have to plan for this and infrastructure is part of the solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">We need proper airports and safe boats for our people. When talking about the islands another resource we must tap into is our fishing industry. The island people play an important role in this industry and deserve our support. We can look at the fishing industry from a number of angles, such as support for local communities, jobs and economic development – and now, the health care issue. The eating of fish and the development of a quality health care policy in this country must be interlinked. This should be part of the broader health strategy. Quality diet with fish as a major component, benefits all our society. Medical experts both in Ireland and abroad, demand we eat more fish. Again, we can use this health argument to develop and assist our islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Fish processing at home must be part of our economic strategy. The people on the islands and along our coasts have an expertise on these issues. Any sensible Government or politicians will listen to their views. To develop these strategies and ideas, transport services must be of a high quality and standard for us to benefit from our fishing wealth and the practical experience of the people of the islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">I welcome this legislation and the opportunity to put on record my support for the development of transport services for our island communities.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_577">I just made a point and I think I am entitled to make it. The other thing I welcome is the many urban Deputies who spoke on this quite interesting Bill. I have to commend the various viewpoints that came across from these Deputies for their particular interest in rural affairs. Island people have a great heritage, as well as many people living right across rural Ireland. We have something that is very important to us and this is being increasingly recognised by people in the cities and built-up areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">It is most important that living conditions are made better for those people living on the islands. Everything possible should be done to improve their conditions and to make the islands a better place in which to live. A great quality of life is shared among the people of the islands and the rural parts of the country. However, we have neglected rural areas in the past. We are doing our best to address many of those issues, but when the figures are examined, the truth is that some 18 counties have suffered rural population decline. Some parts of the country are worse than the national average.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I come from what is traditionally recognised as a strong agricultural county. Some areas of my constituency have seen a larger decline in population than the national average which would amaze many. Lack of investment is the cause. For example, there has been no decentralisation to my part of the country. Many areas would benefit greatly from decentralisation by private companies as well as the Government. We have allowed the eastern part of the country to develop greatly but this has resulted in many problems, particularly in Dublin. Those of us who regularly try to travel through the city know the problems resulting from that development while the rest of the country was left without necessary infrastructure. We are paying the price. Every six months we hear about the imminent Government decentralisation programme but nothing is happening. Why not? This was promised by the last Government but alas nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">It is time to bite the bullet on this issue. If the Government decentralises, many parts of the private sector would follow. There is no reason farming organisations, other rural bodies, banks, etc., need to have their centres in Dublin and not scattered around the country. With modern communications there is no reason they could not be decentralised. There is now a strong argument for that because road and rail networks are being  installed that would enable people to move freely around the country. There are also many good schools and regional colleges around the country which would be an advantage to people who want to move their families, whether they are in Government or private sector jobs. Those institutions would benefit as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">The Minister has a keen interest in one-off rural housing and allowing people to live in a rural environment, which has been a major issue for some time. I agree with, and welcome, most of his views on one-off housing as expressed in the national media. Only a few weeks ago the Taoiseach said that one-off rural housing was the biggest issue facing rural Ireland and young people living there, and there is no doubt about it. A week later I asked the Taoiseach on the Order of Business if there was any legislation promised but there is none.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">There is a need for it. Several county councils are going through their county development plans. Although I have been off my council for several weeks I raised this issue, as did many members of the Minister's party, and we were told we could not bring in the changes we wanted.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_224">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_585">It is. The directives are there from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It is true and that is the issue, and if the Minister contacts the planning officers on our county council tomorrow he will hear that they have not been able to bring in those changes. Furthermore, some of the Senators in the Minister's party have told their party members that there are changes coming and they expect them to be made, so there is a breakdown of communication which needs to be fixed. The Minister is shaking his head and I am amazed because I was relying on him as one of the people who would bring about that change. I ask the Minister to at least clarify this to allow people to build their houses and live in rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Leader programme, county enterprise boards, county development boards and FÁS all have a large part to play in rural development and in enhancing rural life. There needs to be more co-ordination between those groups. While the county development board idea was good it does not work on the ground to the benefit of the communities because it is too unco-ordinated. Albert Reynolds created the county enterprise boards when he was Taoiseach. I served on one in my county and it was the best way I ever saw to get to the core of helping people to set up or develop a business. I encourage the Government to consider an enhanced role for these boards which would benefit many. Leader was good in its way but it did not get to the nub of what people wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">People have missed the point about the change in agriculture. The announcement last week on decoupling in agriculture will have a bigger impact on rural communities than was ever envisaged and I am disappointed that we have not had time to get into it here because the announcement last Sunday by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, will bring about great changes. There is a fear, and it will become a reality, that if farmers go a certain way jobs will be lost in our rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">We need a more co-ordinated way to help people, whether they are in rural Ireland or on the islands, and people should not be disadvantaged because they are living in rural areas. I am glad to have had the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill. In my earlier remarks about the text of the Bill I did not intend anything personal against the Minister. I wanted only to make the point.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_589">I too welcome the Minister's views on one-off planning which have been consistently strong. I ask that he does all in his power to make sure that his feelings and concerns, which mirror many of ours in rural areas, are expressed and acted upon on the ground. We can all talk about the changes here but we need to see them spreading through the county councils. Already there have been significant improvements and I am happy with the planning in many areas. However, while the Minister's comments are sincere I expected that the Taoiseach would have something important to say to give people hope when he came out of a recent meeting in Sligo. People come to me believing that it is easy to get planning permission because they hear things are changing. I can tell them only that it is still difficult but that things are improving. It is important to send out a clear message on what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Our planners seem to be trained to keep the number of houses in greenfield sites in rural areas to a minimum. We need to consider what they are learning in college and how they are trained. I urge the Minister to adhere strongly to his position in that regard, which I fully support.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">This Bill has been brought before the House for the purpose of consolidating existing legislation dealing with the provision of public transport to the islands, whether by sea or air. Its aim to update and consolidate the powers of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and his Department is to be welcomed. It is vital that the communities of our offshore islands can be assured of a quality and reliable transport system and I hope the Bill will further facilitate this.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Transport to and from schools and colleges is a vital requirement for young people from the islands. In many cases, their present arrangements involve absence from home during the week. A better transport system might enable them to spend more time at home, which would be to their benefit in many ways. I hope this Bill will lead to some improvement in that regard.  Transport is also an important aspect of infrastructural improvement, job creation and quality of life. From my contact with many young people from island communities, I believe they would prefer to continue to live in their home place, although they sometimes feel they may be missing out on some advantages enjoyed by those of us who live within an hour of Dublin. We should do everything possible to provide comparable opportunities for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Like my party colleagues I am concerned that, beyond the main purpose of this Bill – the consolidation of public transport legislation regarding the islands – there are broader issues which in the past have placed a blight over the efficient functioning and management of public transport to the islands. I will return to these issues shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Undoubtedly, the provision of public transport services is crucial if we are to sustain our nation's offshore islands as vibrant and living communities. There are two sides to the coin. First, the islanders must have confidence that they have a reliable, safe and efficient transport infrastructure which can guarantee them access to the mainland. This is the only way people can be expected to remain on our offshore islands. However, more importantly for long-term sustainability, a quality transport service and broader infrastructure networks are essential if the islands are to attract investment, enterprise, tourism and job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">It is clear that, for the most part, islanders would choose to stay on our offshore islands provided they have employment opportunities and a quality of life on a par with those who live on the mainland. As well as having a quality transport system, other related services such as education and recreational and social infrastructure are vital to sustaining island communities. To date, however, we have not succeeded in sustaining those communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The census figures from 2002 point clearly to the failure of this Government and others to keep our island communities alive and prospering. Census 2002 indicates that between 1996 and 2002, the number of island inhabitants fell by 500. This huge and startling population decline highlights a lack of commitment by the Government to identifying and addressing the pressing needs of island communities, particularly in terms of job creation and investment. I hope the Minister will spearhead a change in that regard. From my conversations with older residents of the islands, I am aware of the efforts they had to make, back in the 1950s and 1960s, to secure basic services such as electricity, transport and harbour facilities. I hope Deputy Ó Cuív's current ministerial brief represents the beginning of a new approach and that it will no longer be necessary for island residents to wait many years for improvements to be made. They should be given all possible hope and encouragement.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Tourism has been very important to our island communities in recent years. It has been of tremendous benefit in providing employment, directly and indirectly. I hope this Bill will bring  further improvements to the public transport system for the islands and assist in increasing the number of tourists who visit them. I am particularly familiar with the situation on Clare Island, where access by ferries or other means becomes more difficult from October onwards, due to weather and tidal conditions. All possible support should be given. I will certainly make my own small contribution by continuing to visit there.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">This Bill places some emphasis on improving air services to our islands and that is a positive development. Clearly, it reflects a broader trend whereby access and affordability of air transport for the ordinary travelling public have increased dramatically in the last 20 years. However, in the process of improving air services and facilities, we must not overlook the situation of the ferry operators and the employment content of their services. There is some concern that in the event of a roll-back in air services in future years, people would be worse off than ever if the ferries had gone out of business in the meantime. If we take a particular course, it is important to have a long-term commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Offshore islanders should not be treated less favourably than other citizens. Increased air travel is now the norm for islanders. That is not surprising, given the shorter travel times and convenience which it provides in getting to the mainland. In this regard, I urge the Minister to ensure that airstrips and aerodromes which facilitate air transport to the islands are prioritised in terms of upgrading, improvement and development of existing facilities and constructing new airstrips where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Ferry services also provide an important element of the transport infrastructure to the islands, but they should be used efficiently. Air transport in off-peak months might be more appropriate for use by island communities, particularly when weather conditions are severe. This would mean that the Department would have to revise its current system of State subsidies to public transport providers and I would urge the Minister to evaluate the merits of this suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">While I welcome this Bill mainly because I hope it will lead to improved transport facilities for islanders and those who wish to visit the islands, I hope mistakes made in the past regarding the provision of public transport services to the islands will not be repeated. There is an issue in terms of providing quality and reliable transport services to the islands. It is also a value for money issue and, as the Minister will be aware, concerns have been raised in the past as to whether these services were provided in the best manner. Poor management and bad practice in the provision of subsidised transport services have been identified in the past by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report for 2001 identified serious concerns regarding the awarding of a contract to provide subsidised ferry services to the islands. The report expressed particular concern about the  renewal of a contract with one ferry company, which had held a contract from 1992 to 1997, without this contract being open to public competition. This was identified as mismanagement and representing poor value for money. I hope the Minister will ensure this does not happen again. There have been other stories which may or may not be true. If the correct procedures are in place, doubts will not arise and the rumour mills will not be at work.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_603">That may be so, but it is important to do all we can to ensure that proper procedures are in operation. Beyond the issue to which I have referred, the Comptroller and Auditor General cited the fact that the Department did not monitor the frequency of the service actually provided before making payments to the service provider. He also stated that the Department could not provide either detailed or summary annual statistics regarding passenger use of the ferry services between Rossaveel and the islands as sailing logs are not generally reviewed. The Department was also unable to provide statistics on the amount of cargo carried on the service. This is just a very short summary of some of the problems identified. However, they are substantial deficiencies and I hope they will not be repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Surveys have indicated that some islanders have expressed concerns that the ferry service between Galway city and the islands often does not run as scheduled. There are problems with transportation of cargo, there are often delays with the Rossaveel bus service and there has been dissatisfaction with the standard of the vessels in some cases. The latter problem was clearly evident earlier this year when the operator of one of the State's subsidised ferries was convicted and fined for breaches of EU food and hygiene regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I support the broad thrust of this Bill. I urge the Minister to ensure that transport services to the islands are undertaken in a more co-ordinated fashion to ensure a better delivery of travel services and value for money. I also urge greater scrutiny of information on usage of travel services to the islands. This could facilitate better monitoring of services and inform better decision making, particularly in awarding State contracts. The people of the islands deserve a quality and reliable transport service, which is efficient and provides best value for money. I hope that is our aim in this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_612">I know it is an important language. I compliment the Minister on his work in the Department and the way in which he thinks of Galway and so on. I hope he will spend as much money in rural areas in County Wexford, which he visited last week, as he does in the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Transport is one of the most important issues on an island. Having visited the Aran Islands and others, it is clear that getting there and back is important. In recent years many Deputies referred to islanders who had been killed on ferries before aircraft were brought into service. Therefore, it is good to see air services in place to carry people between the islands and the mainland.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">A documentary about Aer Arann was broadcast on TG4 last Sunday night. The company runs services between Galway, Dublin, the United Kingdom and Waterford – an important benefit to rural areas. People can avoid bad roads and traffic queues by flying to Dublin in 30 minutes or so. I am surprised by the number of commuters who travel from Galway to Dublin to work. Many leave Galway at 7 a.m. and are home by 7 p.m. that evening. It is important that this type of service continues, particularly for islanders.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">I visited the Aran Islands two years ago and was amazed by the air service. One could take off from the mainland and land on the island within 15 minutes. One could then spend a few hours walking around. I spent a night camping.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_617">I was. I compliment the islanders and the company which operated the service at the time. When a coach load of tourists come to Ireland, they often visit a remote island which is the highlight of their tour. Whenever I have the opportunity to talk to tourists, I ask them what they think of Ireland and where we can improve our tourism product. Many say they had a great time on the Aran Islands, visiting heritage centres which exhibit island life. I was amazed to see the centres one could visit on the Aran Islands and the amount of money which had been spent on them. Simple things had been done in order to make the visit interesting. The interesting exhibits covered life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the fishing boats used and so on. I hope the air service will remain in place for many  years, despite the problems that have been encountered which I trust the Bill will address.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The Bill also deals with communication, the importance of which we are well aware on the mainland, particularly in regard to issues such as broadband, telephone and mobile telephone services. We are living in an age in which we depend totally on communications. It is great to see the development of communications services on the mainland which can be developed on the islands. It is only right that broadband be rolled out to the islands. It is important for us to communicate and for islanders to be enabled to remain on the islands which many left because of the lack of services and transport links. It is good that such services are now in place to prevent this.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">During the summer I read that the Minister had launched a small harbour on one of the islands. The islanders used to have to drag boats onto the rocks. Therefore, it was right that they be provided with such a harbour. The amount of money it cost amazed me because it did not look like a massive job. However, it cost €1 million or €3 million.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_621">On the mainland we think nothing of going to the local shop or supermarket or Dublin for the day, whereas islanders may only be able to get to the shop or post office. I have always been a major supporter of rural communities, at the centre of which are the post office, shops, the Garda station, the community centre and so on which play an important role as the hub. Islanders cannot visit such facilities as easily as those who live on the mainland.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The islands depend financially on tourism. If the transport facilities are not in place, they will not be able to get tourists to visit them. Tourists prefer a short comfortable journey by air rather than an uncomfortable one by sea. Therefore, it is important that such a service be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">There is a lack of transport facilities in rural communities, particularly for the elderly. The County Wexford Partnership recently launched a rural transport initiative whereby a bus collects older people from rural areas. This is particularly useful for those unable to drive. The Minister for Transport introduced regulations requiring an examination for a full driving licence for those who may only have ever held a provisional licence. This affects older people, in particular, who will have to rely on others to drive them into town each day. The rural transport initiative in south Wexford is, therefore, welcome. On Tuesdays and Fridays older people are able to go to New Ross or Waterford to pick up their pension or do their groceries. It important to them to be able to do so because it gives them a break, an opportunity to get out, something we all need.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">The Minister is aware of this initiative which he should examine. More money should be spent on such schemes. When I hold clinics, many  people tell me that they can only get to the local post office, that it is not possible to get to Enniscorthy because there is no transport service. If a service was available, they would use it. Many of them have a free travel pass. It is great that they can make use of it, although the Government might do away with it soon enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Deputy Hayes mentioned rural housing. If we want to keep rural areas alive, housing must be available. I come up against problems with one off housing and planning permission every day of the week. The Taoiseach mentioned the importance of rural housing at the gathering of the Fianna Fáil Party in Sligo in September. Deputies then asked if a Bill would be introduced to deal with the issue and the Taoiseach backed down. He had brought it up as an issue that suited him at the time but rural housing is important and county councils are changing county development plans to allow for it. Every day people contact me about problems with planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Decentralisation was designed to move people away from the major cities into rural communities. The last decentralisation experienced in County Wexford took place under the rainbow coalition and there was plenty because there were two Ministers and a Minister of State from the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_630">People wondered when the gravy train would stop but it did not stop between 1994 and 1997 after which it came to a sudden stop. No gravy train has come since. Sections of the Departments of Agriculture and Food and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were opened and they made a great difference by bringing people who had previously lived in Dublin back to their roots. It brought a boom to the county, although it came to a sudden halt. The number who were happy to move was incredible. There must be more decentralisation. When I was younger, it used to take an hour and a half to get from Wexford to Dublin but it now takes three because of traffic. The more who move from the cities through the decentralisation programme the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I welcome the Bill which contains some interesting ideas. I read the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and would not like to see what happened in the past occur again. Transport to the islands should be an open pro cess and remain at the top of the Minister's agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_632">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. In my constituency there are three islands, Inishbiggle, Clare Island and Inishturk. Off Clew Bay there are 365, one for every day of the week, the people of which were forgotten for many years. They were let down by all previous Governments. Nothing was done for them and they were let go their own way, the reason so many of them left.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">No Government took the islands seriously until the rainbow Government, when former Deputy Donal Carey, as Minister of State at the then Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, started the work that has since been continued by the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs – I will give credit where it is due. The Minister and Donal Carey are the only two people I have seen do anything for the islands since I entered politics and I compliment both of them. Donal Carey introduced the legislation and the Minister continued that work and did a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">During the years islanders wanted a few simple things. The most important part of island life is access, getting in and out. For years piers were unsafe; there were no ferries and we were not prepared to give island communities the same subsidies we gave to Bus Éireann, Irish Rail and other bodies. The Minister and I have talked about Inishbiggle on many occasions. If the facilities were put in place and the island was promoted, there would be thousands visiting every year. It takes four minutes to get there but the sea current on the journey is the most dangerous in the world; it would sweep anyone away in a very short time. That is the reason the island communities were so concerned about access.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">We have talked about a cable car to Inishbiggle for many years. The Bill should enable the Minister and the Department to make the final push to get it up and running in order that the people of Inishbiggle can promote the island. The Minister has played his role and the local problems and legal difficulties have been dealt with. Finances are now tight but the Minister and I both know that it is essential infrastructure for the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">It is not often I praise Mayo County Council but it has been of great assistance to the Minister. Even before he took office, the council was promoting the islands to the best of its ability, yet they never had the same level of funding. In most projects such as water supply, sewerage schemes, roads or piers, the Department supplies 40%, 50% and 70% of the funding, which the county council has to match. Mayo County Council has never been found wanting in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The Minister will recall the case of an island off County Galway which wanted to transfer to County Mayo because it was felt Galway County Council was not providing for the inhabitants. I presume that has changed since Deputy Ó Cuív  was made Minister. However, there was a time this particular island felt that Mayo County Council would make the effort to provide the infrastructure needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I am not discussing the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the ferry services, as the Minister and I have disagreed on the issuing of ferry licences. That has now been regulated with a tender process for licences and this saves the public from anything underhanded going on. In the past, we had licences given out that are now finding their way to the courts because of disputes. However, I welcome the Bill's proposals on subsidising island ferry services as they are entitled to it. It is only fair and right that the Department subsidises any person providing such services. Island life is not easy and if we want people to continue living on the islands, they must be able to get on and off the islands 52 weeks of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">I take this opportunity to compliment the Air Corps for being good to the islands over the years. I am aware, and so is the Minister, that at times it is called out to the islands on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and New Year's Day. I thank the Air Corps for the support and assistance it has given island communities over the years. Many times the Minister and I have phone calls on Christmas Eve from island communities who have not been able to get on and off the island due to bad sea swells. The only way they could get their Christmas dinner was through the Air Corps bringing people and goods in. In some cases, members of the Air Corps have risked their lives for the job they do for the islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I welcome the provision regarding airstrips in the Bill. Every island should have an airstrip on the basis that even if it is only to land small aeroplanes or helicopters, it should be in place and subsidised. The weather during winter does not make it easy for boats to get in and out of an island, making airstrips important. Another good provision in the Bill is for transport at pick-up points where people come off an island. There is not much point coming from Inisbiggle to Ballycroy or Clare Island to Roonagh Pier when no taxi or public transport is provided. I welcome the Minister's proposals as a step in the right direction. It is only right that this service be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">The time has come for island people to be able to vote in general and local elections on the same day as the mainland. I remember during one election a garda who would not bring the ballot box in from Inisbiggle because the boat was not licensed. That was the only election in which I did not get a vote from Inisbiggle. I was glad that he never brought in the ballot box again on the boat because I got a few votes from the island. I am not saying anything untold occurred. However, I always remember him carrying the ballot box across the water like Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">There is a problem with the provision of clergy for the islands. In the three islands in my constituency, the priest only goes out at weekends. All  the islands at one time had their own full-time priests. It is a sign of the times that they now have to share a priest. It is the reality they must suffer and it shows what is happening in wider rural life.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the health boards have worked for the provision of health care facilities for Clare Island and, particularly, Inisturk. They have a right to these services. However, I wish to see the day that we see more children staying on the islands. It is sad to see island children coming into schools in Louisburgh and Galway. They arrive on a Sunday night and stay until Friday night, but, in some cases, they might not be able to return because of adverse weather conditions. The time has come, where possible and with the numbers, that we look to building secondary schools on the islands. There must be nothing worse than a young boy or girl having to leave his or her home on a Sunday evening, travel to a strange town and stay in bed and breakfast or digs until the following Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">We speak about poverty proofing with regard to different Bills that come through the House. We should also look at "island-proofing" Bills. Whatever legislation comes through the Dáil, the Minister and his Department should check it to ensure that it suits the islands. It is not right that legislation is introduced when six months later, for example, an island post office is closed because of a lack of numbers. This use of legislation against island communities affects their welfare. It should be a democratic right, regardless of the population of the islands, that legislation should not be used against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I always give credit where it is due. The Minister has been a reasonable man on these issues and more of his Cabinet colleagues should look at how he does business. There cannot always be legislation for different locations, particularly in rural areas. One certainly cannot use legislation drafted for the mainland for the islands because there are different circumstances and reasons. The Minister and his Department should ensure that all legislation should be "island-proofed" so it is not used against the islands at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Mayo County Council has almost completed a housing project on Clare Island and there is a waiting list. That proves that if the Minister puts the infrastructure, facilities and housing in place, people will remain living on the islands. No matter where one is born, that is where one loves and wants to be. There are many people who would return to the islands if the facilities were there. Those island children who attend school and third level courses off the islands, spend more time off than on them. If the facilities were on the islands, they would never leave. They would grow up, get married and have children on the islands. However, it is not the case because the infrastructure is not there and they have been let down by previous Governments. I am glad that the necessary funding is being put in place for the provision of these facilities. It is important that island  communities have the opportunity to live, work and rear families where they want to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">It is not easy being in an island community. I know the Minister has done his best on social welfare and island payments. However, with the forthcoming budget, there should be special payments for people living on islands. To bring foodstuffs, feedstuffs and cattle on to an island costs more than it does on the mainland. The island communities are entitled to be subsidised in order that the costs of bringing goods on to the islands will have some parity with mainland costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The work done by the Minister and before him the former Minister of State, Donal Carey, in setting up the committees within the islands has been successful. The Minister has listened to them, supported them and worked with them. Who knows best? It is not the Minister, the officials in the Department or the county councils but the people who live on the islands 52 weeks a year. They know the problems and difficulties and what they want. I was at Doran's Point in Ballycroy recently and it is great to see a simple job that did not cost €1 million. It cost small money and was supported by the Department and the county council. Although there is a difficulty with the transport service, the work done has given the people concerned the opportunity to access the island. However, the facility is now in place and it is safe. Many more simple things like this could be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The Minister looked after another island with only one family. No other Minister would have taken it on board and I am sure the Department resisted him every step of the way. This was appropriate to accommodate a farmer who wanted to live and raise his family on the island. A wonderful pier has been provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">Electricity has been supplied to many islands during the years. Those living on islands are entitled to the same facilities as everybody else. These are all positive developments in recent years and it is great to see them happening. I do not begrudge one penny the islanders get. It is wonderful that people are prepared and want to live on the islands. The Government should be helping and working with them to try to keep them there.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">As the Minister sees in County Galway and as I see in County Mayo, if more facilities were provided, thousands would travel to the islands, particularly with the good summer we had this year. It is a wonderful day out to bring children and show them how the other half lives. There is a special way about islanders. It is a way of life that we are losing and we should not allow it to happen any more. We should protect the few who are there. We should help and encourage them and provide the facilities. It would not cost big money in the context of the overall budget of the economy. The piers and harbours being provided represent money well spent by the taxpayer. I do  not see any wastage. Nobody on the mainland would begrudge the islanders these facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">In future I hope more money will be spent and more people will go back to the islands. I hope the county councils will build more houses and the health boards will provide as many services as possible on the islands in order that they do not have to come to the mainland for the basic necessities. It is now possible for an X-ray to be taken on an island and viewed in Dublin. These facilities should be provided in order that people living on the islands do not have to get on a boat in the morning and drive all the way to Beaumont Hospital or St. Luke's Hospital. Nobody would begrudge them such facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The Minister should keep up the good work. I come from a rural constituency with three active islands and 365 in total – one for each day of the year. It would be wrong not to provide the funding for the necessary infrastructure to allow the people concerned live where they were born. We have lost enough islanders; those who are left should be helped and rewarded for staying. I like islanders who are decent people. It is a difficult way of life. While it is not easy for them to make a living, they succeed in doing so. As the Minister knows from his visits, there is something about them. He will have my support from this side of the House in giving them whatever support they need. When I get into government to do the job the Minister is doing, I will make sure we do whatever has to be done for them.</p>

          <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
          <p eId="para_654">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le chuile dhuine a labhair sa díospóireacht seo. I thank everybody who contributed so positively to a useful and broad-ranging debate. I will respond to some of the issues raised by Deputy Ring. My original plan was to build the cable car link from the mainland to Inishbiggle. However, events intervened. If I had known then what I know now, I would have done it. We should have provided the slips at Doran's Point at Ballycroy. Once the slips are completed, I intend to advertise for a ferry service for which there will be a connecting bus service. As the Deputy eloquently pointed out, while Ballycroy is a fine place, there is no point leaving somebody standing there on a pier. As a short-term measure, this should bring regularity and safety to the people of Inishbiggle, which I hope will be useful for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I would like to give an overview of what we are doing for the islands. I also compliment the work done by the former Minister of State, Donal Carey, who operated with a very small budget. He set up the island fund. As Deputies know, once there is a budget heading, it can always be increased. The difficulty is to get the heading in the first place. When all the money was taken into  account, the budget was only €2.5 million which has risen to €8.5 million per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Whenever I visited an island the first thing people talked about was access and piers. We have now provided about six or seven in County Cork alone. We have done Cunnamore, Sherkin, Long, Hare and Whiddy. Some work was done on Bere Island. County Cork was ahead of the posse because the people there had their homework done. We are planning major works for the piers on the Aran Islands and will be moving up the coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">As Deputies are probably aware, we are on the point of finalising a tender process in conjunction with Mayo County Council. We had hoped to start earlier but, as always, there were some minor problems. We hope to carry out the two biggest ever contracts for island piers on Clare Island and Inisturk. We have already commenced construction work on Roonagh Pier which will improve the level of safety of considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">We have also addressed a number of small piers. We have approved funding for Inishlyre and done the pier on Clynish. People will ask the reason we have done those islands given that Inishlyre, for example, only has three families on it. There is a certain amount of money provided for islands. Once a year I meet all members of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann which represents Inis Mór, the biggest island, down to the smallest island with one person. They always tell me they want the small islands looked after as well as the big islands. The days are gone when we only looked after the Aran Islands – perhaps only Inis Mór. They see themselves as an inclusive family and want those small islands looked after, even including the tidal islands like Iniscuttle and Inisnakillew.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Moving up the coast, we have done work on the pier on Arranmore. We have done major work at Magheroarty. A large contract on Tory Island commenced by my predecessors, Deputy Michael Higgins and Donal Carey, has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Other things have been done on the islands, particularly work on roads. When I first went to Inishturk, I was told to forget about everything else and address the issue of roads to people's houses. There were islands without water services. This was the top priority for those living on Dursey Island and a number of other islands, including Clynish. Some of the islands which are inhabited only seasonally for fishing and farming had no electricity service. People moved away because of the problem of schools for children. Inishbofin in County Donegal has a vibrant population from early spring until late summer where all the houses are kept and there is electricity. Other islands are Gola Island, Coney Island, Inse Gort, Inis Ladhair, Inis Treamhar, Inis Fearracháin and so on down the coast. We have done  eight or ten islands, the ESB has been marvellously accommodating and the work was done at a very good cost. We have built health centres and social facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The issue of schools was raised and this is central to the question of staying on an island. I have examined what we have done and what needs to be done. There are 13 primary schools on 11 islands. Some have more than one school. These have a viable primary school population and obviously there is no point talking about a secondary school if there is not even a primary school.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Regarding the arrangements for secondary schools, two new secondary schools opened during my term as Minister, on Inis Meáin and Tory Island. Five out of the 11 islands have secondary schools which leaves six that do not. The children on two of these, Sherkin and Bere islands, go to school every day on the mainland and return in the evening. There was no ferry in Sherkin Island and we arranged for one to bring the children out in the morning and back in the evening. This means families have stayed on the island who would have otherwise left for their children to obtain a secondary education.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Children on Bere Island always went to school on the mainland, but I managed this year, along with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to rectify what was a farcical situation. The children were given transport to the pier at Castletownbere on the mainland but were not brought from there to the school. It was good enough to bring them that far and they had to make their own way from there to school. We have arranged transport to the school, which is a modest improvement on the face of it but a major improvement for those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">This leaves four islands that depend on the remote area grant and whose children must attend school on the mainland. These are Clare Island, Inishturk, Inishbofin and Cape Clear. The problem is that there is an insufficient population to maintain a secondary school. Parents will not accept a second level school if the numbers are unrealistic. In three of these cases we have put bus connections in place which mean that, when the children reach the mainland, they are brought to the school they attend and similarly in the other direction the day the school closes. If the school has a day off, which can happen on a Monday, or holidays, everything is tailored to ensure the bus, which is part of the ferry contract, collects them on the day school finishes.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">For example, the Inishbofin children are brought to St. Jarlath's and Kylemore and the children from Clare Island and Inishturk to Louisburgh where the majority of them attend school. These services have changed the situation radically for children. Islanders in the 25 to 30 age bracket would have tended to go away to school, coming home only for the mid-term break and  Christmas with the result that the connection was lost with the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">One of the reasons for this Bill is to ensure that all this is legal. It is desirable and no one can argue with this. I doubt that anyone would challenge it legally, but there appears to be some doubt about the legality of these arrangements and I will not allow any such doubt where there is a moral certainty about what we are doing and it is the right action to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The issue of doctors and medical services for the islands is very important and one of our major achievements was to have a full-time doctor on a third island, namely, Inis Oirr, which is the third most populated island. We also introduced the islander's allowance which is a special social welfare allowance of €12.70 per week for those who are permanently incapacitated or are of pensionable age to make up for the greater cost of living on an island. There is a myth that it is cheap to live on an island. It is not. It is incredibly expensive because everything must be brought in. To build a house is much more expensive. We introduced much higher new house grants and they still are in place for Gaeltacht islands.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">We also have a special concessionary rate of car tax on the islands. This is important. I have discussed with insurance companies my intention that all island cars will be taxed and insured and that the situation that existed before does not continue. It is not satisfactory and there must be a clampdown. We have a concessionary rate of car tax because an island only has about two to three miles of road and it would be unfair to have to pay the mainland rate of car tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Some of the islands have roll-on roll-off ferries. The car tax for the islands is similar to Oisín in Tír na nÓg who, if he put his foot on the land of Ireland, would become 300 years old. If someone on Bere Island, Arranmore or one of the islands with a car ferry brings his or her car over to the mainland and begins to drive, he or she is immediately liable for the mainland car tax rate. No matter where he or she lives, the island rate will not cover him or her on the mainland. It only covers a car that remains on an island permanently.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I wish to address the issue which has been raised repeatedly of ferry services, value for money and the Committee of Public Accounts. I do not wish to rehash the detail because this has been thoroughly thrashed out and discussed in terms of the historical and Accounting Officer side at the Committee of Public Accounts. As Deputy O'Dowd first raised this query and he is his party's spokesperson, I will arrange to have the Blacks of the committee discussion sent to his pigeonhole. However, there are political issues I would like to clarify and place in context.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">As far back as I and anyone on the Aran Islands can remember and probably back to the time of the British, there was a passenger and  freight service from Galway to the three Aran Islands. When I was a child, the boat was the <i>Dún Aengus </i>which was followed by the <i>Naomh Éanna </i>which was used in the film “Michael Collins”. That boat was run by CIE and the records show that, in the 1970s, the annual cost of the subsidy was £400,000. This was at a time when money was worth much more than it is today and we know the punt is worth approximately €1.20. The issue must be placed in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">A competition was held in 1992 by the then Department of Transport for the provision of a new service to the Aran Islands. It is on the record, and all the islanders know, that I favoured the provision of the passenger services from Rossaveel at the time. I was a backbencher then. The decision taken by the Department was to commission a brand new boat to bring passengers and freight in the old fashioned arrangement from Galway to the three islands and back. I favoured Rossaveel because a private operator had begun a service from there to the islands. I had gone on holidays to Inis Meáin in the late 1960s and early 1970s and knew that it took a day to get into the island and another to get out under the old arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">When I was appointed to the Department, the contract had expired on its first phase, but it was written in such a way that it had a roll-over clause. In investigating the matter, it was found that the 1946 Act required that there be a service from Galway to the islands and I was advised that it had to be from Galway and that the bus from Rossaveel did not make up for the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">These were constraints but there was a third and larger constraint. I sent a public servant to the islands who met the people on Inis Mór, Inis Meáin and Inis Oirr. The people on the two smaller islands were insistent that we continue with the contract from Galway for passengers and freight. I thought they were wrong. There were serious legal doubts, given the manner in which the contract had been written, as to what freedom I had in the re-negotiation of the contract. I believed that, if the islanders on the two smaller islands experienced the type of service those on Inis Mór received from Rossaveel, they would quickly accept the Rossaveel service.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">It is important to put on record that an increase in the annual payment of IR£75,000 was given over the first five years. This was very important in terms of providing extra and improved services to the people in the two small Aran Islands. As my first step in doing something about ferry services, despite inflation, I negotiated a decrease in the annual price for the next seven years which means that the amount being paid in 2003 and 2004 is exactly the annual payment paid in 1992. One will buy very few things in this country in 2003 for the 1992 price. In order to achieve that saving I agreed a two year extension to 2003 and 2004, but it was all at a flat rate at the level of the 1992 price. If it was good value in 1992 on a pub lic tender, the logic is that it must be brilliant value in 2003 and 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">As a political strategy, it served its political purposes. I was constrained in my actions by the law and by the existing contract and its wording. The IR£75,000 was used to subsidise the service from Rossaveel to the two small islands and the rest is history. Within two or three years, exactly the same service was provided to the two small islands as to Inis Mór at a very economic rate although everyone said that could not be done. I managed to bring the passenger services on the two small islands to the same level as to the big island and increase business.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">It is amazing how quickly people forget. I am very friendly with the people of Inis Meán and Inis Oirr. I have known many of them for 30 or 40 years and I tease them about the fact that they never take the boat to Galway that they fought so hard to retain in 1997. They all favour the passenger service I implemented. Like everything else, change is always difficult. They did not realise how good the service would be, but when it came there was no contest and they all transferred. In the review in which we are involved, the big argument is that there is a fast service. A person can be on any one of the Aran Islands in the morning, go into Galway to transact business and be back on the island in the evening on 364 days of the year. It closes down for Christmas Day.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">When I became Minister, the ferry services were disorganised. The boat to Arranmore was owned by Údarás; the subsidy to Tory was provided by Údarás; the Department owned the boat to Cape Clear and every island seemed to have its own unique service. I thought it was a crazy situation. The craziest aspect was there were no services whatsoever to the non-Gaeltacht islands. There was nothing for Clare Island, Inishturk and Inisbofin – no subsidy and no standards. I had to work with the existing arrangements, but as they came up for renewal I introduced services to 14 islands. In the case of Cape Clear, the Department leased the boat to the operator as a first step towards putting the same system in operation for all the islands. The Department took over the service from Údarás and now a similar service operates to all the islands with the exception of the boat from Galway to the Aran Islands which is mainly a freight boat. However, when that contract ends in 2004, it is intended to put the final piece of the jigsaw in place. In anticipation, the Department has commissioned a study to examine all the freight and passenger requirements on the islands so that by the end of next year there will be a coherent island ferry strategy that stands up to any analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Department has improved the monitoring of financial control. Since I became Minister, all new contracts go to public tender. Independent verification of the tenders is done by outsiders to  ensure everything is open, fair and transparent. I am never personally involved in the tender assessment process. Once the tender is received, I stand back. I pride myself that the Department has a small staff. I do not want to spend all my money in checking the obvious. If any of the Deputies opposite ever sit in this seat, he or she will know within 24 hours if a ferry boat did not sail. Deputy Ring represents island communities and he would be informed fairly quickly if the boat stopped running from Clare Island. I do not have to send somebody down to check – although it is done on a spot-check basis – because the people would be on to Deputy Ring in the morning and he would contact me. I am sure he would get me out of bed to tell me. There must be some balance in this matter. A good monitoring system should operate but there is no point in my sending someone down to Clare Island every day when I know that the island community council and the manager, Dónal O'Shea, would be in touch with me immediately if the boat decided it was not going to sail in line with the contract. Those contracts for ferry services are all written in stone and are always drawn up in consultation with the islanders.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">I wish to speak about the global issues of cost and numbers. I will return to the matter of the freight service to the Aran Islands in a moment. It is an anomaly that hangs over from 1992 and is coming to an end. The remainder of the 14 services carried 264,602 passengers. The cost per passenger is €3.90. Rather than costing each individual boat for the information of the House I will look at the global costing. The cost of carrying a passenger on Iarnród Éireann is higher. The cost of carrying a passenger on the rural transport system is higher. The cost of the cheapest subsidies on the aircraft from the regional airports to Dublin is ten times that amount. I can say with confidence that the Department is getting a hell of a good deal. There are very few public transport services in this country that are giving such good value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">People argue that we are subsidising tourists whereas it is the tourists who are subsidising the boats. The fixed costs are there and would still exist even if the absence of tourist revenue. There seems to be an implication that the Department did not know what kind of freight was being carried to the Aran Islands by the <i>Oileán Arainn. </i>In 2000, 7,933 tonnes were carried; in 2001 it dropped to 7,100 tonnes; and in 2002 it dropped to 5,987 tonnes. Thankfully in the nine months of 2003 to date, 7,444 tonnes were carried. These statistics must be factored in when the service is being examined. It is no longer mainly a passenger service, but rather a freight service.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">I have fought for many years to stress the importance of the air services in particular to the more isolated islands with a good population base. Bere island and Arranmore have six ser vices a day. There are problems with the topography of Inishturk but air services are potentially very important for Tory Island. I wish to make it clear that there is no question of an either-or situation arising here. The air service is more expensive per passenger, but the second issue is that the aircraft can only carry nine passengers or eight passengers to the full load of cargo. If a group wishes to travel to an island, there is no point in telling it to take the aeroplane because most of its members will be left on the tarmac. The air service provides a different service. To say that one or the other should be the answer is equivalent to making a decision to have either boats or aeroplanes crossing the Irish Sea but not both. The mode of transport is decided by what one is transporting.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">It is very obvious in the Aran Islands that 125,000 people are carried on the boats, that aeroplane usage is rising dramatically but boat usage is not dropping. It is the old Aer Lingus-Ryanair syndrome, the improvement in the services is creating the numbers and one is feeding the other, not taking from the other. It means more movement of a greater number of people. My commitment is to provide top quality services to the islands as long as the budgets, with which I have been very lucky to date, hold out.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Tuigim gur thóg an Teachta McGinley ceist maidir le Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann agus an bhfuiltear ag iarraidh oifigeach a fhostú. Tá comhráití ar bun, agus tá iarratas faighte. Tá súil agam breathnú ar an gceist sin go luath. Thiocfainn go hiomlán leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Ring faoi chúrsaí vótála.

          <p eId="para_685">Deputy O'Shea referred to the drop in islands population by 500. He is correct according to the census figures. His figures comprise all of the islands, including those which are connected to the mainland by bridges. Achill is included, as are Lettermore, Lettermullen and Gorumna, islands with over 1,000 people, and Bull Island and Lambay in Dublin. Spike Island is also included and its population is down by 40. There must have been very few prisoners there that weekend. The drop in inhabited offshore islands, with which this Bill is concerned, was about 186 people. That is a serious drop. It is becoming more difficult on census day to get a real fix because it depends how many people were home for that weekend and so on. The last census was taken on a weekend near a bank holiday weekend.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">Yes, it can. Sunday night is a bad one for a rural census because anybody working away is gone even if he or she comes home  faithfully every weekend. However there are other factors at play. We all know the rural population challenge is great, in part because we are still dealing with the hangover of the 1950s and 1960s when the high emigration of women left many bachelor farmers in rural Ireland. That is still working its way out of our statistics. I am concerned, as I do not like to see any drop but I do not see it as a doomsday scenario. Thankfully some island populations have increased. There has been a stabilisation and it is interesting to note that, for example, islands such as the Aran Islands, which are a DED in their own right, are not in the CLÁR programme because they have not suffered as much depopulation as equivalent mainland areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I will deal briefly with the many points raised on broader issues of rural development. Legislation is not required for planning because there is no legislative bar to county councils allowing rural houses. If anybody can show to me, or to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, that there is such a bar, we will look at it. I said that publicly when speaking on this subject recently. Directions exist, particularly arising from the sustainable development guidelines published in April 1997 by the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, that seemed to be directed against what was termed urban generated housing. Those have been superseded by the national spatial strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">In law, local authorities must have regard for Government policy. I advise Deputies or anybody involved in the county plan to read the relevant sections of the spatial strategy because it is a clear statement of the Government's position on rural housing. People who live permanently in real rural areas should be accommodated in the BMW region but in areas of urban pressure there have to be controls, which are attachment to the place either by virtue of growing up there or of working there. It is a balanced and fair strategy which is in line with what I propounded as early as 1997 long before I was Minister with responsibility for rural development.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">As a member of a local authority in 1997, long before I became a Minister, we wrote the plan in County Galway because we were the only ones with the legal authority to write it. The council official can advise but the councillors write the plan. I advise councillors who cry about this to go and write their plans. There is nothing to stop them. The only sanction a council official can bring against them is if he or she can prove that they broke the law and refer the matter to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Galway County Council members, from all parties, dealt with the problem effectively by drafting the wording from the spatial strategy into the county plan. The logic was that if council officials said that the county plan was not in accordance with Government policy that would mean the spatial strategy was not Government policy, which is a patent nonsense. We need to have more debate on this issue because there seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about it. I do not blame people. I am aware of the amount of paperwork with which we all have to contend. I accept that people get confused. We should not run away and believe the rumour.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">I am concerned with retaining and building rural communities not about people making handy money by selling off sites. It is not about that and I do not think anybody in this House is concerned about anything other than this primary concern, namely the importance of retaining our rural communities as viable entities. When the rural house planning guidelines are published by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it is my intention that we will engage in a detailed debate on this issue to try to deal with legitimate issues that have been raised in regard to the environment and visual impact.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">It could best be debated in one of the committees of the House where matters could be teased out in detail. In terms of rural development generally, we have set up the CLÁR programme which I think is doing good work. It is not the solution to all our problems but it is making a significant difference. I am working on the issue of decentralisation and Westrail and I have asked the Western Development Commission to do some work on the ground with the local authorities in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I am also seriously examining the possibility of a European rural development policy, separate from the agriculture portfolio, which will come very much to the fore. All the indications lie in that direction with the enlargement of the Union. I have instituted a rural enterprise review which will report by Christmas. There are complexities in this regard which I do not have time to go into today, but there are issues that need to be examined and then we need action.</p>

I fully agree that the NRA appears to have disregarded the national development plan in the past three years. The Government set down its targets in the NDP and what Deputies are measuring that failure against is Government policy as laid down. The NRA is an independent agency. I assure Deputies that I am not happy as Minister with responsibility for rural development that the NRA has failed to achieve the targets set out. I expect those targets to be achieved fully by the end of 2006.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">The interdepartmental group receives regular reports from the relevant Departments and agencies involved in the implementation of the strategy as well as reports from the national drugs strategy team, the young people's facilities and services fund and the national advisory committee on drugs. As regards the six-monthly progress reports, approximately one third of the 100 actions have either been completed or are ongoing during the life of the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Areas in which progress has been made are as follows. Customs and excise officials have launched a coastal watch programme and implemented a number of measures to enhance  drug detection capacity at entry points. Guidelines to assist schools in the development of drugs policies have been drawn up and were issued to all primary and post-primary schools last year. The Department of Education and Science is now represented on all local drugs task forces which meets a long-standing demand of the community. The Department has recruited extra support staff to assist in this role.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Considerable progress has also been made by increasing the number of people in receipt of methadone treatment. By this summer, 6,700 methadone treatment places had been provided which is ahead of the target set in the strategy. Only three years ago, the number was 5,000. My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, and I launched a national awareness campaign last May which has continued since on radio and television. The second phase of the campaign, which will be aimed specifically at parents, is currently being rolled out. The report of the benzodiazepine working group was published at the end of last year and the Department of Health and Children is overseeing the establishment of a working group to consider its recommendations. Over 1,100 recovering drug misusers are on special FÁS community employment schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The national advisory committee on drugs was established to provide solid information and to carry out research. It has done a great deal of important work. The committee has published an overview of current research into drug prevention and completed reviews of prevalence information and contemporary literature regarding the consequences of drug misuse for families and communities. It has commissioned a longitudinal study of treatment outcomes and it has published a report on the effectiveness of buprenorphine. The committee has carried out a survey on the estimates of the number of opiate users and last Monday it released the first results of an all-Ireland survey of drugs misuse, which was the first such survey conducted here. Last year, the national committee launched a community and voluntary research grant scheme to generate innovative community-based drugs research.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">There are 14 local drugs task forces most of which are based in Dublin. They are carrying out good work in co-operation with the community to bring forward action plans. Through partnership, the task forces are addressing all the service gaps in this area and co-ordinating existing services. The local drugs task forces are currently implementing their second round of action plans in respect of which, to date, over €14.5 million has been allocated on an annual cost basis. Since 1997, we have allocated about €65 million to implement 500 projects under the various task force plans. Much good work has been done and continues to be done at community level.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">In addition to the funding of drugs task forces, an allocation of €12.7 million was provided under  the premises initiative which was designed to address the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects. The majority of these are found in local drugs task force areas. Of that money, €11.5 million has been allocated to 38 projects. The young people's facilities and services fund is another initiative which is carrying out fine work, mainly in the local drugs task force areas. The aim of the fund is to attract at-risk young people into sport and recreational facilities and activities to divert them from the dangers of substance misuse. To date, €59 million has been allocated for this purpose, €54 million of which was invested in local drugs task force areas. That money has been used to provide 350 facility and services projects, community centres, purpose-built youth centres, 85 youth and outreach workers, ten sports workers and many community-based prevention and education programmes. A considerable amount of work has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Great things are being accomplished under the drugs strategy and a great deal of funding is being provided. I said yesterday in answer to a parliamentary question that certain alterations had been made to the dormant accounts disbursement plan to ring fence some moneys for drugs task force areas. That will help to continue to provide the level of funding needed. I do not disagree with the basic premise of Deputy O'Dowd's Bill which is that CAB proceeds should be spent on drugs projects. It is a demand of community groups in areas which have been ravaged by drugs and there is a great deal of merit in the suggestion. From my point of view, once the funding is forthcoming, I do not care whether it comes from that source or general Exchequer resources. Given the level of funding over the years, it might not be an improvement to be told that one is limited to the level of the ring-fenced funds. I accept the basic principle in which there is logic. It would be good to get the money.</p>

          <p eId="para_727">I would fight for it more if it was greater than the amount I am currently receiving. Since I believe the money from the fund would be much lower, I would be nervous about adopting fully what the Deputy is saying. However, I accept the principle and that it depends on demand from the community. I understand what the Deputy is saying in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">We are doing quite well in relation to the young people's facilities and services fund and the local drugs task force fund. I hope this will continue. The Government is continuing to invest in the process. This year the allocation for the drugs subhead increased by approximately 16% over the figure for last year. I accept there will be  further demands on the fund next year when plans are brought forward from the regional drugs task forces. I hope money will be invested in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Since 1997, when the drugs scheme was up and running, the Government has allocated €135 million for a range of measures, including the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund. All but a small portion of this money has been spent on local drugs task force areas. I want to send out the message that while a lot of resources have been spent, we could do with more. There is a commitment from Government in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">I am aware of the Deputy's demands. If money continues to be made available, people at community level will not mind whether it comes from the CAB fund or the Exchequer.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_731">I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Connor.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">I commend Deputy O'Dowd for the intention behind the Bill before the House, that is, that local community and voluntary organisations should be funded to continue to carry out the very valuable work they do in the areas of prevention and treatment of drug addiction and its consequences. Unfortunately, trafficking and dealing in drugs are crimes with which we are all too familiar. The Garda Síochána, with the full support of the Government, continues to have successes in targeting the evil activities of the traffickers. The success of the Criminal Assets Bureau, in particular, has been referred to on a number of occasions during the debate. We must continue our commitment to tackle organised crime and drug trafficking on a practical level. I take this opportunity to wish Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, and the Garda Síochána continued success in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The success of the CAB has brought it home to the criminal gangs that we will not tolerate their activities. Most of the gangs of the early 1990s have been broken up while their bosses are either in prison or have left the jurisdiction. Criminals continue to be targeted. The CAB takes the necessary action in accordance with Garda functions under Revenue and social welfare laws to seize or restrain the use of assets derived from serious criminal activity. This is not mentioned often enough. It is important to underline the success of the CAB's activities and congratulate all those involved. In so doing, we should give credit to my ministerial colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the late Eamon Leahy, who used their initiative in an innovative way to bring about the success of the CAB.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_275" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_735">I congratulate all involved, particularly the two people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">In relation to drug trafficking, our legislative package for tackling this form of criminal activity is regarded as one of the toughest in Europe. We need to consistently evaluate its use to ensure its effectiveness because, as we know, the people with whom we are dealing are continually trying to look for loopholes in the law. Major seizures of serious drugs such as heroin and cocaine continue to be made. I congratulate the Garda Síochána and the Customs authorities for their ongoing high level of success in this regard. Their dedication and resolve to carry out the task of reducing the supply of drugs available mean that the performance targets set under the national strategy are being met successfully. While, on the one hand, this continued level of success is a good sign, reflecting the effective work of the Garda and Customs services, on the other, it demonstrates that organised criminals continue their efforts to make major profits, no matter how harmful the effect on citizens. The Government recognises that seizures, while very welcome, must be just one part of the overall strategy in fighting the scourge of drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Obviously, the problem of drug misuse remains one of the greatest social problems of our time. Apart from our continuing efforts on the drugs supply and control side, we need to continue to develop a range of responses, addressing both the cause and consequences of the problem. It is to this end that the Government's overall policy to tackle the drugs problem is set out in the national drugs strategy which brings together all elements of the drugs policy in a single framework for the next six years to tackle the problem in an integrated fashion, involving the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Much has been happening in recent years, particularly in the communities hardest hit by drugs. They have been the focus of major policy development involving, for example, urban renewal schemes and cross-development programmes designed to speed up the process whereby communities can more speedily draw down public resources. The availability of drug treatment and other rehabilitation services has also increased dramatically. The national drugs strategy and local and regional drugs task forces have rightly been praised for facilitating the mobilisation of cross-agency forces. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, addressed the topic in greater detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The Government will not rest in its efforts to aid the law enforcement agencies in their fight to tackle the drugs problem. It is worth drawing attention to a new framework for joint investigation teams which will allow for more effective cross-Border and international investigations of organised crime, including drug crime. The Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill  gives effect to the European Union agreement and provides for the establishment by member states of joint investigation teams to carry out cross-Border criminal investigations. This is recognition of the need for member states to work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Further legislative measures will be taken in the near future to enhance the ability of the Garda Síochána to take part effectively in international police co-operation. As drug trafficking is an international crime, active involvement in law enforcement at European and international level remains a key element of the Irish response. The Garda liaison officers based in London, Paris, The Hague and Madrid, as well as the Europol and Interpol headquarters, facilitate international co-operation, especially in the area of drug related crime. In addition, relevant Garda support units such as the national drugs unit are in regular contact with colleagues in other jurisdictions. The sharing of intelligence, with joint operations which often cross jurisdictions in a single operation, has resulted in large drugs seizures bound for Ireland and in criminals being brought to justice. Congratulations are due to all involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">It is vital to ensure emerging trends in organised crime are analysed and monitored in order that the effective legal measures and operational policies are developed in a coherent and co-ordinated strategy. Anticipating trends is more and more important as organised criminal gangs respond to new opportunities, nationally and internationally. Intelligence led policy and international co-operation in responding to serious criminal activity are elements of an important strategy which must be pursued.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">We must also be aware of the link between drug trafficking, organised crime and the threat it poses to our society. All criminal organisations have used and will continue to use violence and intimidation. This is now a new phenomenon. Organised crime, by its very nature, creates a climate of fear, not just for the general public but also for criminals. The use of violence and intimidation within criminal groups is a challenge to our law enforcement agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">There is also a problem with non-reporting by victims to the lawful authorities. Killings within the criminal fraternity are usually well planned and executed and, because of their nature, often more difficult to detect. Often there is less evidence available to aid the Garda investigations. The Garda needs the help of local communities in investigating such crimes. In response to a series of incidents, the Garda has appealed to the community for help and has guaranteed the safety of persons willing to give assistance and information.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Despite the difficulties I have faith in the Garda Síochána in taking on these criminals. The establishment of specialised Garda units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation,  the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda National Drug Unit operate under an assistant commissioner in charge of national support service, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime far more effectively than heretofore. Other smaller units, including the money laundering investigation unit and the unit dealing with theft of computer components have also had success in combating the activities of organised crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">I am reassured by the Garda Commissioner who has informed the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that in regard to recent violent incidents he is happy that the necessary resources have been directed towards these areas of criminal activity. A continued pro-active and integrated approach is being taken by the Garda into the investigation of cases where there is suspicion of involvement of organised criminals. An example of such action is the Garda directing of additional resources, in addition to utilising the support of the Garda national support units and services, to tackle particular difficulties being experienced in Finglas and Limerick City. I am pleased particular operations are in train against the violent criminal activities which have been taking place in those areas. To date these operations have proved successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Garda needs also to tackle the supply of drugs on the streets. I commend the work undertaken by Operation Dóchas, Operation Clean Street and Operation Nightcap which have been used to target street dealing and the distribution of drugs in night clubs and public houses. These operations have led to hundreds of arrests and charges and the seizure of drugs with a street value running to millions of euro. These operations, carried out by the Garda National Drugs Unit, were aimed at street dealing blackspots, concert events and licensed premises where suspected drug dealing was taking place. In the debate yesterday, some Deputies made a connection between drug abuse and the high level of alcohol consumption by young people and the public order problems that ensue. I am pleased the Government is taking strong action to deal with these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 gives significant additional powers when dealing with drunken disorder. The Act is aimed at addressing the problem of late night street violence which has its origins in or outside licensed premises and fast food outlets in urban areas. The Act strengthens existing Garda powers in this area and extends the sanctions which may be imposed on offenders under the 1994 Public Act order. The Act provides the Garda with the new power of applying to the District Court for a closure order which would limit the opening hours of premises associated with such serious trouble. The second key provision in the Act introduces  exclusion orders by means of which public order offenders may be barred from being at specific places for up to one year. A breach of this order will be a serious offence, punishable by a substantial fine or a term of imprisonment. All sections of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 are in operation since 29 November 2002. It is intended that these urgent reforms will improve compliance with an enforcement of the licensing laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I am satisfied the Government has put in place a number of legislative provisions which give the Garda sufficient powers to deal with the problem of drunkenness, thuggery and drug misuse which it faces on a daily basis. The responsibility for crime prevention and enforcement cannot rest solely on the Garda and the criminal justice system generally. Local authorities have also an important role to play.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The new Garda Síochána Bill proposes a formalised consultation process in the form of local policing committees which will formulate and oversee the implementation of measures of co-operation between the local authority and the Garda aimed at reducing crime and disorder and combating the misuse of alcohol and drugs. On a broader scale the Garda Síochána Bill being developed by the Government will replace completely the existing statutory basis for the Garda Síochána with a new modern and forward-looking legal framework. That framework will set out the relationship between the force and the Government and between the force and public representatives, national and local. It will provide also for a separation of responsibilities between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the commissioner in matters of policy and management for new arrangements in respect of financial accountability and for new powers to enable the force to continue to concentrate on core policing functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">We are fortunate to have a police force of the professionalism and character of the Garda Síochána. The people continue to acknowledge the high standards which the force has demonstrated for the past 80 years. In dealing with the changing pattern of crime there are difficult and complex issues to be addressed. I have no doubt the Garda Síochána will successfully meet these challenges and in doing so will have my full support and the support of those on this side of the House.</p>

I am a strong supporter of both Ministers of State and have worked closely with them on problems relating to my constituency. I applaud what they are  doing.

          <p eId="para_755">Being a humble Fianna Fáil backbencher is not easy. I have to find my own way of doing my job. Those who may be checking on what I am doing will note that in my Dáil questions, day in day out, I ask many questions about the justice remit. I talk about Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue, the need for more Garda resources, the need for gardaí on the street dealing with the issues. There is a serious point which has to be made, to which other colleagues have alluded, and I hope my colleagues opposite will do so tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The question of the disposal of proceeds of crime is a matter we all debate. I take the view, simplistic as it is, that the victims of crime should benefit when moneys are seized. I include in that such organisations as Victim Support, not only in Tallaght but throughout the country, because it does a tremendous work in helping victims and it should get funds. If money is confiscated from criminals that is where it should go. There is an active Victim Support group in Tallaght which operates from the courthouse. It has a huge remit and a great deal of work to do. The more help it receives the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">As a major urban centre, Tallaght is no different from anywhere else. In the past we have had problems which have been alluded to by the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. All colleagues, certainly in city constituencies, and even colleagues in many constituencies around the country, have the same problem. We should support the various programmes. For example, in my constituency the Garda intervention scheme should be beefed up and more resources poured into it. My colleageue, Chris Flood, was a predecessor of the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and also of the former Minister of State, Deputy Eoin Ryan, who will make a great MEP after the European elections next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_759">I will support him. The former Deputy, Chris Flood, did a tremendous amount of work and still works closely with me. We remind each other daily of the challenges which major urban centres, such as Tallaght, face so far as drugs and other community needs are concerned. I have no hesitation in saying to Govern ment that where these moneys are available this is where they should go.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The Minister of State will be aware I have his support. Every time he makes a positive announcement for Tallaght I will be on his side and every time he does not I shall remind him. In debating this matter I will make the case for my own constituency. I am also amenable to cases made by other colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">It is important that we understand the problems crime and drugs bring to families and ordinary people in our communities. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, spoke about CAB and I agree with every word he said. It is important we support that work. Where moneys and assets are available we should seize them. Let us give the Garda and authorities every opportunity and resource they need to do that. However, when we get it we should not bury it but use it for our communities. We must identify needs and disadvantaged communities. I talked about victim support, drug support and Garda programmes and these are what we should be building.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_762">I wish to share time with Deputies Twomey, Gregory, Finian McGrath and Cuffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">If ever a Fine Gael Bill deserved full cross-party support, this is it. It is a pity that Government, up to now, has not supported it. We are talking about a lot of money which will sit doing nothing until such time as some Minister decides to give it to our Minister for Finance where it will be lost and buried. It will be lost to the very communities that should gain something in return for the hardship they have had to suffer. They have put up with the squalor in which they have had to live because of the drugs problem brought on them by drugs barons here and from outside our shores.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">We recognise that the solution to the drugs problem involves more than moving drug dealing off the streets and arresting drug dealers. I congratulate gardaí on managing to succeed in confiscating these assets. The sum involved is huge. Gardaí also need to do more to tackle open drug dealing on our streets, particularly in inner city areas. People come from all over Dublin to Ballyfermot, where I live, to avail of the drugs supermarket there. They also travel to Thomas Street in the south-west inner city. Over 20 years, successive Governments have not managed to tackle the underlying problems of these two areas which have been described as disadvantaged areas in all indices, whether educational such as low attainment standards, or unemployment figures. To this day the highest percentage of unemployed people are in Cherry Orchard. The highest concentration of drug addicts in Europe is in the south-west inner city. Twenty years later we are still trying  to discuss where and how this problem should be tackled. We have 14 drugs task forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The only criticism I would have of this Bill is that the initiatives it mentions are slightly limited. We should ensure that all community initiatives and youth programmes in areas which have suffered the scourge of drugs are able to benefit from this. I mention in particular the 14 drugs task force areas. The money should come down to them. It should be ring-fenced. It should not replace existing funding but must be supplementary and additional. When the national lottery funding was announced it was supposed to be additional. However, it is now the only funding on which many organisations can depend.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">This must be additional money and must be given out. Investment in youth programmes, youth clubs, sport and education in these areas would pay dividends because that is how we can start to row back and reverse the problems of the areas. It is how we can get the communities to rebuild themselves into the proud communities they once were. There is much happening in these areas on which people should be congratulated. I mention Addiction Response in Crumlin and Theatre Workshop in Ballyfermot, and there are many more. It is a sad indictment of society that there must still be so many of these groups 20 years on. We should have less need for them. There should be more focus on our youth.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I urge the Government to support the Fine Gael Bill. We can then deal with it in committee and add the changes required.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_768">I too support Fine Gael on this issue. The drugs trade is a multimillion euro business where profits are huge. There will always be a market for drugs because of their mood altering and addictive effects.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">For years drug abuse has been restricted to a number of inner city communities in all our cities, especially Dublin. Now, these same drugs are freely available all over Ireland. It is strange that today drug dealers are no longer following the stereotype. Many of them are ordinary men and women who make easy money selling drugs. It is also regretful that over time drugs have become almost socially acceptable. As a doctor, I have often had patients tell me what drugs they took the night before and the effect the drugs had on them. People often return home after a night out drinking and then take more alcohol, speed, smoke cannabis or do cocaine, which is no longer a yuppie drug, especially in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Drug taking is becoming socially acceptable. Our enforcement is failing greatly with regard to restricting the supply of drugs. We need to become innovative in our effort to find a solution to deal with the problem. Often people who want treatment have nowhere to go or have to wait so long that they lose the desire for treatment for  their addiction and they get caught back in the cycle of drugs, stealing, and prison. It is an indictment of us as legislators and of our priorities. We have allowed this drug culture to get out of control over a short period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">I hope everyone supports this Bill. It could be an initiative that would help to stem the tide of the drug trade here. The Government must also invest much more than what will come from CAB to help boost the enforcement agencies. Unless we stop drugs coming into the country or stop the major suppliers we have no hope of controlling the trade. It is already out of control. Drugs are almost acceptable in every corner of the country. Some Deputies will point out areas which have a worse problem than most of the country but the problem is everywhere. I hope this Bill will be the start of progress in combating this problem.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_772">I too support this Bill. I have raised this issue in the House on successive occasions over the years, at the direct request of many local community organisations and anti-drug groups in areas of Dublin city which have suffered greatly over the past 20 years as a result of the drugs crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Put simply, where assets are confiscated by the courts from drug dealers, and where these moneys are then returned to the Exchequer, the Government of the day in the person of the Minister with responsibility for the drugs issue should in each case make special grants available of the same amount as that confiscated, to community and sports projects in the drugs task force areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">This proposal would not cost the State or the taxpayer a single penny. It would simply involve the redirection of moneys seized from drug dealers back to those whom drug dealers have already exploited. It would also take the form of an additional grant to underresourced community facilities. There would be no question of the moneys replacing other grants currently available or of community projects having to wait until confiscated moneys became available. This proposal would simply provide an additional resource for underresourced projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I campaigned in recent years for the establishment of the youth facilities fund which is now in place and was disbursing grants to drugs task force areas. This fund was most worthwhile and represents a tremendous initiative in the provision and financial underpinning of community youth and sports projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Unfortunately, the present Government has reneged on its commitment to this fund. The second phase of grants has not been paid out and is more than a year overdue. This is a scandal and highlights the fact that not only are the proceeds of drug related crime not redirected back into the drug-hit communities, but the Government fund has been put on hold and youth facilities are being starved of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Parts of Dublin Central, for example the Dominick Street-Dorset Street area, which suffered greatly from the drugs crisis, continue to be neglected by Government and the plans for youth workers in a youth centre there have been shelved. Many other projects cannot proceed because phase 2 funding has not been sanctioned. Perhaps the Government spokesperson, when replying to this debate, might respond also on this very relevant issue. It seems reasonable and logical that communities which struggled against the drug dealers, marched against them, worked to provide treatment centres for the victims of drug abuse and which are now working to provide youth facilities, should be given direct grants from the moneys confiscated from those who made vast profits by exploiting young people in the areas to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Most people now agree that it was neglect on the part of successive Governments which gave rise to the heroin crisis in disadvantaged communities. State neglect led to direct community action and this in turn led to belated Government action. It would be an appropriate and worthwhile gesture if Government were to agree to the action proposed in this Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_779">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 2003, an excellent Bill which I will be supporting. I have a particular interest in this debate as I have worked in the north inner city of Dublin for nearly 20 years. I have seen the major damage brought upon communities and the death and destruction dealt out by the drugs gangs. I have also experienced their intimidation and stood with communities that were under threat.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">I agree with the sentiments of the legislation as it is only fair that all proceeds of crime should go to the most disadvantaged communities. Yesterday in Coolock, in my constituency, I attended the graduation of eight young people who were addicts, came through treatment and counselling, then obtained certificates in computer studies and have completed and passed all seven modules of the ECDL.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Like all good community-based projects, funding is always a problem. Imagine the work these centres could do if they got their hands of some of the proceeds of crime money. These are the projects and creative ideas that should be funded on the principles laid out in this legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to address some difficulties with regard to the retention and expenditure of the proceeds of crime, which accrue under the Act of 1996. It is to be effected by making three minor textual amendments to the Act of 1996. I particularly welcome section 4(1), which technically amends section 4(1) of the Act of 1996 by reducing the waiting period from seven years to three. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 has enabled the authorities to accumulate consider able sums which, once acquired, must be retained for a period of at least seven years, which is unnecessarily excessive. This section is relevant and more common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">It is essential not to forget the communities that have to live with this nightmare. There are places in this city and country where children cannot play or grow up naturally, or live out their lives as children, because of needles and heroin, violence and death. This is the other side of the so-called prosperous Ireland. The Celtic tiger did not look after her cubs. It bypassed 90,000 children still in poverty. Out of these 90,000 approximately 3,000 are seriously at risk and live in violent dysfunctional families. These are the prisoners of tomorrow, the ones that will end up in Mountjoy. They need urgent help and early intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">There are many family support groups and many teachers with plans and strategies to help these children at risk. This Bill has the potential and above all, the cash, to assist them. It is time the Government stopped huffing and puffing. I call on all Deputies to support this new and radical legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_784">It gives me pleasure to support this Fine Gael Bill. On behalf of the Green Party, we are happy to support it, albeit with some reservations. It is worth discussing the general issue of drug abuse in the context of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Drug abuse is a social justice issue. As has been stated many times over the last ten or 15 years, we cannot look at drug abuse or criminal activity in isolation. Within the inner city of Dublin one can see the factors that influence drug abuse and criminal activity and ask what can be done. We need to tackle the issues of housing, education, providing sporting facilities, environmental improvements, play facilities. All these areas of need have to be tackled from birth and beyond, the different stages of a child's life, to encourage young people not to turn away from society.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">There is an element of naiveté in the Government's approach to this general issue of drug abuse and drug activity. I was nauseated by the remarks of the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, a few days ago, when he suggested that we should be tackling the parents in regard to children's crimes. That displays a massive ignorance of the social and family circumstances in which young people turn to crime. He should get out there and listen carefully to what people working with young criminals have to say. He would think again about implementing the provisions of the legislation he was talking about at the recent Fianna Fáil gathering.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">It is a worthy Bill, but we have three specific reservations. It provides for a definition of drug related initiatives which enables the Minister to ensure that the proceeds of drug related activities  are distributed to organisations that aim to redress the damages caused by such activities. I wonder about specifically defining one criminal activity such as drug abuse. By defining drug related initiatives we are giving status to one criminal activity over another. I could understand if there were no other legislation dealing with this particular issue, but there is a reference to combating drug trafficking under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and I am somewhat unclear as to why the distinction is being made in the amending Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">My second point is whether the provision applying the proceeds of drug related activities to organisations that are working to redress the damages of such criminal activity is valid. It should not apply just to drugs. This procedure should be adopted across the board as there are numerous bodies that do tremendous work in the community to combat a wide range of criminal activities. It would be wrong, I feel, to be seen to be giving one organisation preferential treatment over another, simply because they work in combating drugs. The activities I mentioned earlier – housing, education, health care, play facilities – are not always specifically designated to tackling drugs. There could therefore be a certain blurring at the edges of which I would be wary.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">A final point relates to the length of time for which moneys must be withheld. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 enables authorities to retain considerable sums of money for a period of seven years and the Bill aims to reduce this to three years. I am curious as to how this timeframe was decided on. Is it not more practical to assess the retention of money on a case by case basis, not exceeding the three year period recommended in the Bill? In other words, we would like to see the moneys used sooner and applied much more quickly in those disadvantaged areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">To generalise about the Bill, the Green Party welcomes it and thinks it is a good step in the right direction. It shows some clear thinking from Fine Gael on this issue and we look forward to voting in favour of the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_288">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_791">I wish to share my time with Deputies Coveney, Neville and Perry. I compliment Deputy O'Dowd on introducing this Private Members' Bill. It is long overdue and I agree fully with his sentiment that the money should be ring-fenced and that the period should be reduced from seven to three years. I was a member of Government between 1994 and 1997, when the ministerial task force on drugs was set up, and I was privileged to be a member of that group chaired by Deputy Rabbitte. One of the group's recommendations was that 11 task forces would be set up throughout the country, ten in Dublin and one in Cork. One of the first statements came from the Southern Health Board when the centre  was set up in Cork, to the effect that there was no heroin or other major drug problem in Cork. The health board missed the point that the Cork centre was a preventive programme because we were working on the basis that prevention is better than cure.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">We worked also on the principle that sports and youth services are the greatest preventive elements in the fight against crime and drugs. The problem was that once the moneys were available, the statutory agencies attempted what I call the "big grab". They had all the resources and expertise to plead the case for the resources that were available. Thankfully that did not happen, even though much of the money went to those statutory agencies. The danger I see in this is that the usual agencies, the prison services, the health services and so on would attract most of the funding, and the voluntary groups would be away down the line. Those involved in sports and youth services would be left waiting while the others had quick access to the money. Much has happened since 1997 and 1998. The national plan for sport published in 1997 emphasised the principle that sport and youth services would be very important preventive elements in the fight against crime and drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Since then, the key principles of that report have been watered down because there has been a drift away from emphasis on participatory and community sport at grassroots level. This has been replaced by what is almost an obsession, especially on the part of the Taoiseach and some of his key Ministers, with professional, spectator sport, national facilities – or monuments to their own egos if one wanted to be unkind – undermining the key factors of funding sport at grassroots. That also entails investment in professional sport, in the pub culture, with which it is linked, and the Sky Sports syndrome whereby people go out at 2 p.m., watch a match and stay in the pubs until 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., and go on to nightclubs, resulting in trouble at 2 a.m. with people either going to some quiet place to take drugs, or worse, becoming involved in violence on the streets. There has been an over-emphasis on professional and spectator sport and that is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I almost cry when I see some of the important groups in my area which have to plead and beg for small amounts of money to keep their operations going. I will not be too parochial and will give only one example. Blackpool Youth Club this year was refused a grant to build a modest facility in an area where it has been operating very successfully for 25 years, getting young people of both sexes involved in theatre and sport. It was left high and dry without funding. The club held a meeting with the local Deputies at which a Fianna Fáil Deputy said that its members would have to come up to Dublin to meet a civil servant. That should not be neces sary. The group was told that its application did not meet some of the required parameters. It did not meet these because it was too busy doing the work it was set up to do, dealing with young people. Some of the more affluent organisations can either use their own expertise or buy in expertise to make professional presentations and win funds. There should be positive discrimination in favour of groups in deprived areas, especially areas hit hard by drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The pub culture is supreme, aided and abetted by the man at the top, the Taoiseach with his obsession with national stadiums and spectator sports, which sends out all the wrong messages and leaves organisations working in the communities feeling unappreciated and unsupported.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_796">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and thank Deputy O'Dowd for bringing forward a very sensible Bill. The Government could easily accept this legislation because it is not political and does not criticise it. On the contrary, it offers the Government a source of finance for an area that desperately needs an increase in resources. I am very disappointed that Government Deputies have adopted a negative approach to a very sensible and practical effort by Deputy O'Dowd to put together workable legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Deputy is attempting to get agreement on legislation that would facilitate the ring-fencing of moneys accrued by the Criminal Assets Bureau to be spent on specific projects, largely in disadvantaged areas. This would make a positive impact on the constant struggle to prevent and reduce drug abuse. We should not easily accept the principle of ring-fencing capital and thereby diverting it from the national Exchequer. It is a dangerous precedent to set if it is done too often. However, in this case it is highly appropriate that the proceeds of criminal, and in many cases gangland, activity such as smuggling and dealing drugs should be driven back into trying to prevent the problems caused by such activities. On those grounds I support the principle of ring-fencing in this instance. Speakers in this debate have adverted to examples where ring-fencing has been accepted and introduced in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Since 1996 CAB has taken €16 million in assets under the proceeds of crime, due to be released into the Exchequer next year after the set seven year period. This coincides with a time when we have a very active and serious drug problem. Whether one looks at the report of the National Advisory Committee on Drugs or at the UN study on ecstasy and amphetamines, highlighted last week by Antonio Maria Costa, chief executive of the UN ODCCP, one will see that we have a serious problem, primarily among young people, with illegal drug use and indeed legal drug use, chiefly alcohol. Whether it is cannabis, ecstasy, speed and other amphetamines, cocaine,  heroin, of which there are almost 15,000 users in Dublin, or alcohol, it is quite clear that the Government is losing the battle to reduce the amount of drug abuse. We need more resources and we need to prioritise this area further.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I give credit to the national drugs strategy as a document. Its proposals represent the right way forward, but its implementation has been a serious problem. I do not accept that it is a national strategy. From an implementation point of view it has been a Dublin heroin strategy and, to that extent, has been quite successful in certain communities. I pay tribute to the many people working as part of that strategy in treating heroin users and so on. Three years ago when we launched the review of the national drugs strategy, the Government committed to extending the strategy away from its focus on heroin, and beyond Dublin and the one Cork area referred to by Deputy Allen. That has not happened. Health board areas have been required to put together and implement their own drug strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Greater priority and significantly more resources are required in the struggle against drug abuse and this Bill proposes an appropriate way to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"/>

        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_802">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and to compliment Deputy O'Dowd on its introduction. He said his aim was to ensure that the proceeds of assets seized by the CAB are applied to appropriate initiatives focused on redressing the damage caused by those engaged in drug-related activities. I wish to refer to a group of people who are damaged by drug-related activities and those who take their own lives or attempt suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Drugs and alcohol play a key role in that regard, though not the only role as it is a very complex area. I propose to outline how the Irish Association of Suicidology, of which I am honoured to be president, would use a sum in the region of €700,000 to €1 million to counteract the problem. We know there were 451 deaths in this context last year. There is no simple solution and the paths to suicide are many and varied. There is no single cause of suicide, which can result from many interweaving influences and factors, including drugs and alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Clinical research indicates that the best way to prevent suicide is through early recognition and treatment of depression and other psychiatric illnesses. Research clearly points to the need for development of a more accessible service for those at risk of suicidal behaviour, especially in rural areas. In order to tackle this growing tragedy in Ireland, it is essential to put in place a systematic approach to the prevention of suicidal behaviour. The best way to tackle this complex issue is through a multi-sectional partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">When faced with a serious health problem, the temptation is to address it aggressively, head-on,  thereby highlighting the incidence. In the case of suicide, it has been proven that highlighting the incidence can lead to copy-cat suicide, also known as suicide contagion. A suicide prevention programme must be based on empirically validated and effective prevention programmes, as outlined in the report of the national task force on suicide prevention. If funding is provided, a programme can be put in place. Given the scale of implementing a national prevention programme, in terms of potential target audience, prioritisation is essential and I will outline a programme in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">An integrated communications strategy would set out agreed objectives. All messages and activities would be tested in terms of how well they served these objectives. Where practical, those objectives would be measurable. We would target three areas, including the health care service, public target groups and the media. In relation to health care service groups, we would target information at clinicians, researchers, voluntary groups, the Samaritans, Grow, Aware and community groups. In the public target groups, we would include primary, secondary and tertiary students and parents. We would look at youth groups, the National Youth Council, high risk groups and the unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">We would especially target those recently discharged from a psychiatric hospital, who have 200 to 400 times greater potential to die by suicide than the general population. Those involved in drug and alcohol abuse would be regarded as a target group. We would target the national and regional media, including newspapers, radio, television, student and consumer media and even soap operas. We would establish a press office to organise media workshops and develop guidelines, newsletters and educational support literature for schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">We would develop a website on suicide prevention and introduce a national help-line, which has been shown in recent Italian studies to be very effective. We would undertake a feasibility study on a national telephone hot line service, offering advice and information. We would also consider an awareness programme in schools. We would operate on a professional basis, with a clear programme and objectives, if the Irish Association of Suicidology was given the money to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_809">I draw the attention of the House to the substantial resources which have accrued to the CAB under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. When the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform came before the Committee of Public Accounts last May, he stated that CAB had collected €56 million in taxes since its establishment. Furthermore, CAB had an estimated €19 million worth of prop erty frozen under interlocutory orders of the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">As seven years must elapse before the property in question can vest in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, or the legitimate owner as determined by the courts, the property seized will start to come into the State's possession from next year. In so far as the Public Accounts Committee could ascertain, this property has not been independently assessed. Accordingly, it is possible that more than €19 million worth of property could be on the State's books in the coming years. In 2000 alone, CAB obtained interim orders on property to the value of about €22.5 million. This property can be frozen by CAB on foot of an interlocutory order of the High Court if a person cannot prove that it was legitimately obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">The sums of money involved are very substantial. The Minister insists that these funds should go directly to the central fund. We have already exposed the fallacy of this argument. For example, the tax on plastic bags is ring-fenced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under a very effective system and a sum of €157 million was given to the Department of Health and Children in 2002, arising from receipts from certain excise duties on tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Those are two examples of funds being ring-fenced by the Government in a public policy area. Since the environment was being degraded by plastic bags, it was very appropriate to reserve funds raised through the levy to protect the environment. The Minister for Finance has ring-fenced 1.5% of GNP for the national pension reserve fund. What has he to say in this regard? On the basis that the health services have had to deal with the consequences of smoking habits of many of our citizens, the Department of Health and Children has been given this extra source of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Of course, ring-fencing of State funds should not be a general principle of public expenditure, but exceptions should be allowed where there is a particularly close connection between the behaviour being taxed and the relevant public prevention programme. That is the case in the context of this Bill, in a situation where drug barons make fortunes in the midst of dreadful poverty. They are even seen as role models in their communities by some impressionable young people. Not only would CAB bring these gangsters to book, but the inhabitants of communities ravaged by drug abuse would witness the wealth generated at their expense being channelled directly towards undoing the damage caused by the individuals concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">This Bill is not just about the funding of drug treatment services. It is also about the principle of restorative justice. In a sense, drug barons have become the equivalent, in their communities, of  the Denis O'Briens and Tony O'Reillys of the business world. When CAB appropriates the ill-gotten wealth accumulated from their ruthless and illicit operations, it is morally right to direct it back to the people who have been exploited and corruptly influenced by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">I applaud this Bill and compliment Deputy O'Dowd on his initiative in introducing it. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Dea)</from>
          <p eId="para_816">There can be no argument about the terrible damage done to communities in the towns and cities of this country by the evil trade in illicit drugs. This is particularly true of some of the most disadvantaged urban areas about which Deputies spoke in the debate on this Private Members' Bill yesterday evening and tonight. There can be no argument about the desire of all Members of this House to see this scourge defeated. Any measure which has this as its aim is worthy of careful consideration and I commend Deputy O'Dowd in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I acknowledge the commendable intentions of this Bill. Communities and voluntary groups need support in their efforts to provide treatment, counselling and education facilities to persons afflicted by drug addiction or to divert young people at risk from falling into a life of drugs, about which there is no argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">We heard earlier about the Government's national strategy in this regard and the commitment shown through its investment in that strategy. We heard about the allocation of more than €130 million since 1997 by this Government to projects in the local drugs task force areas, the very areas to which Deputies referred as being among the most socially disadvantaged. We also heard of further funding to the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and the 64 Garda youth diversion projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">On foot of the identification of local drugs task forces as an important element in the overall response to the drug problem, the extension of this model is being delivered to other parts of the country through the establishment of regional drugs task forces. I should also mention that the new Garda Síochána Bill being developed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will allow for structured consultation between local authorities and the Garda Síochána in regard to the policing needs of local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The point must be made that the investment in this range of projects is many multiples of the amount for which the Criminal Assets Bureau has obtained interim and final restraint orders in cases where the assets involved were linked to drug dealing. This investment in local communities is only one arm of the Government's strategy to tackle the problem of drugs. The strategy also involves major initiatives to tackle drugs from the  supply side. The national strategy sets performance indicators over its lifetime for the volume of drugs seized to increase by 25% by the end of 2004 and by 50% by end 2008, using the 2000 figures as a baseline.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I am pleased that the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise Service are achieving considerable success on this target to date. The street value of drugs seized by the Garda has increased from €20 million in 2000 to €49 million in 2002 and Customs and Excise seizures have also risen from €11 million in 2000 to €34 million in 2002. In the first half of this year, the value of significant drug seizures by the Garda is estimated at approximately €67 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Garda operations at street level also continue to have an impact. Operations such as Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Nightcap have been used to target on-street dealing and the distribution of controlled drugs in nightclubs and licensed premises. During 2002, Operation Dóchas yielded seizures of drugs with an estimated street value of nearly €3.3 million and resulted in 3,337 arrests, of which 1,725 people were charged. Operations Cleanstreet and Nightcap yielded seizures of drugs with an estimated street value of almost €31,000 and 615 arrests in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">While these figures are welcome, they also serve to demonstrate the ongoing determination of criminals to pursue this trade and the ongoing challenge facing the Government in the full implementation of the national drugs strategy. However, the Government is committed to this implementation and continues to treat the issue of drugs as one of priority. A strong legislative package is in place to tackle drug dealing including the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 which provides for the detention for up to seven days for drug trafficking offences and allows inferences to be drawn by a court from the failure of an accused to mention particular facts during questioning; the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act 1997, which enables the Garda to deal with drug abuse in dance halls, pubs and other places of entertainment; the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which deals with the problems arising from drug dealing and serious anti-social behaviour in local authority estates; and the Criminal Justice Act 1999, which provides for minimum mandatory sentences for persons convicted of dealing with drugs of or over a certain value.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">In addition, the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act are central to the legislative response to organised crime in general, including the illicit drugs trade. The Government has a Bill proposing amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act before this House at present. This Bill, following a detailed and valuable process of consultation, contains a body of amendments which are well thought out and will clarify and enhance the powers of the Criminal Assets  Bureau. They will also give statutory effect to a number of decisions of the courts which will be vital for certainty in the conduct of investigations by the CAB. These amendments were outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, yesterday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Important legal and policy issues are raised by the proposed amendments contained in Deputy O'Dowd's Private Members' Bill that deserve consideration, having as they do the intention of combating the harm to society from illicit drugs. While some of these issues have been aired already in this debate, detailed consideration can be given on Committee Stage of the Government Bill when these proposals can be seen in the context of a complete package of amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_293">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_826">This proposal will ring-fence drugs proceeds for drug treatment and drug-related services in order to speed up access to the money collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau. The seriousness of the situation depends on which report one reads. Last week, a UN report stated that young Irish people were the highest abusers of amphetamines and ecstasy. This was contradicted to some extent by the national advisory committee on drugs report which placed Ireland in the middle band, stating that we are slightly higher users of some drugs, but not all. Another report from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction stated that Irish young people are the highest offenders when it comes to solvent use.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Whatever statistics or reports one chooses to believe, I must take notice of the Garda Commissioner's comments to the justice committee last week that the drug culture is growing. Commissioner Conroy also stated that Irish gangs are linked to criminal gangs in Spain and The Netherlands. He pointed out that criminal gangs are terrorising entire neighbourhoods, murdering their drug dealing opponents and that the Government must provide the resources to the Garda Síochána to allow it to do its job. It is clear from the situation in Limerick in the past year that those resources have not been forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Limerick is a classic example of the Government losing control of the streets to violent drug gangs. As people have probably seen in the media, there is an ongoing court case in the city. Some 529 notices were sent to citizens of the city in regard to jury service on the case. An unprecedented number of medical certificates were returned to court officers and 170 people were finally summoned for service. Of those, just 100 turned up in court. It was a miracle that the Courts Service was able to cobble a jury together yesterday and, since then, two jurors have been excused. The level of fear displayed by potential jurors in this case is a disturbing indictment of the Government's policy on crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">People are now more frightened of criminals than they are confident of the authorities protecting them. If ever there was a clearer argument made for additional resourcing of the Garda Síochána, it was made by those terrified citizens in the courtroom yesterday. The gardaí in Limerick are telling people that because of security arrangements around that court case and ongoing murder investigations, they do not have the resources to deal with ongoing criminal activity in the Limerick area. Again and again, this comes back to resources for the Garda Síochána. Whether in the case of the present Garda Commissioner, Mr. Conroy, or his predecessor, Mr. Pat Byrne, the Government has not listened and is not listening. That a jury cannot be formed for a murder trial is the Government's legacy on drugs and crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Last week, at a major international drug conference, the Government's record was outlined. Irish drug groups made it clear they had their budgets cut this year. Health board funding is down by between 7% and 9%, with no money planned for new drug services. The implementation of local drug task force projects is being blocked at senior departmental levels. The Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund has been effectively dismantled and regional drug task forces have only administrative budgets with no money for programmes. Rehabilitation and after care projects in every health board area were to have been in place at the end of last year but that has not happened. More gardaí were to have been deployed in local drug task forces by the end of 2001, but that has not happened either. That is the Government's record when it comes to drugs and crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">One finds some Ministers' comments quite strange. For example, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, observed last year that we did not seem to be causing the traffickers much pain. The price of drugs is decreasing and plenty of them are getting into the State. All we can do is keep up the fight and hit the drug pushers as hard and as often as possible. The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, cited example after example of drug seizures. If he spoke to senior gardaí, they would tell him that they are successful every now and then but a far larger amount of drugs is coming into Ireland and the situation is getting much worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">Compare the reality of the situation with such comments and the fact that the Government is cutting resources to combat drugs. This proposal is not unreasonable when one considers how bad the situation has become. This Government has failed miserably and for once it should seriously consider an Opposition proposal and not object to it, just for form's sake.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_833">This Bill has received much acclaim in the House and Deputy O'Dowd is to be commended on its introduction. Strangely, the Bill is like the potential son in law, "a nice guy, but. . . . ". It demonstrates a weakness of the House that the Government will not take it on board despite all the praise it has received.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The concept of giving money back to the community is not unique. Money in the environmental fund goes back to the community. We should be more progressive and accept the Bill. We often talk about politicians living in an ivory tower. If there is one issue where that is true, it is the abuse of drugs in this country. Drugs are classless. Speakers have mentioned Tallaght and Ballyfermot but drugs cross every divide in the country. The manifestation may be more severe in some areas, but they exist in every town and on every street. We are doing very little about it, we have lost the battle and will continue to do so irrespective of the legislation we pass unless the will exists to address the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">In many communities, law abiding people are terrified of the drug user next door knocking on the door at night to look for a lift to pick up his supply. The suppliers are former paramilitaries and godfathers of crime, those whom we used to call "the untouchables". They still exist because we have never addressed this problem. We must start fighting now.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Has the Taoiseach ever raised this issue with the few countries that are the main suppliers of drugs into Europe? We must start there. The end user is the victim, as is the link man who supplies him. The methadone maintenance programme is in place but there must be something beyond that because many communities refuse to assist in the establishment of facilities to deal with this habit.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">In my constituency, two people died from drug overdoses last year and a few weeks ago there was an horrific incident where a youngster plucked out his eye with pliers while under the influence of drugs. He was in the process of trying to remove his other eye when he was intercepted. We are sweeping these facts under the carpet and failing to address them. This Bill is about social justice and it is a matter of regret that the Government will not take it on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">I heard a student from UCC speaking on the radio about facilities in schools and communities that should be opened after hours. We should use such facilities. I was in Turkey during the summer and saw open spaces, not just 40 square metres in one corner of the estate, where people can socially interact with each other. In the next few months local authorities will be establishing levies for infrastructural projects. Sporting and voluntary organisations that assist with the provision of facilities in the community should be exempt from such levies. I call on the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to use his influence with his col league, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to send out an instruction to the local authorities to examine the concept of levies on sporting organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I commend Deputy O'Dowd on this progressive, welcome legislation which will appear on the Statute Book some day.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_295">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_840">I thank Members on all sides for expressing their views. I learned a great deal from what they said and that is what this House is all about, the frank exchange of views and moving the issue forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Deputy Gay Mitchell and I were invited by Dublin Citywide Drugs Crisis Campaign to a ceremony of remembrance for all those who had died as a result of drug abuse. We sat in a church where each town was represented and people spoke about their experiences and the effects drugs had on their lives. I compliment the organisation for being the genesis of the demand that comes through this Bill to the House. Campaign members stated that it is time the proceeds of crime were spent in the places where crimes are committed and where people suffer most – the six key areas in Dublin city where people are suffering from drugs, criminality and poor health, and on infrastructure and schools. It is time for the Government to make up its mind on where it stands on disadvantage, drug abuse and helping those communities. They must offer them support by ring-fencing this money, which is already in the Government coffers through the CAB, for them. There is much merit in Deputy's Gregory's idea that communities should apply for this money without its forming part of Government expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Under the Freedom of Information Act, I discovered that the Government funding for the existing level of service in 2002 to fight drugs was €14.2 million. In 2003, €23.9 was required but the Department of Finance reduced the budget to €21 million. The Government is not providing the funding to fight drugs that was passed by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion meaning that projects will not be funded under present budgetary arrangements. That is a disgrace. I utterly refute the fine sounding 20 page script detailing what the Government did or did not do, the reality is that it is not funding the programmes it agreed to fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Other jurisdictions ring-fence money from drugs. The Spanish Government legislated to spend the proceeds of crime in the communities that have suffered most. The Scottish Executive has introduced funding broader than that in this Bill to give the communities that have suffered most the money derived from that suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Where does this Government stand? Where did the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stand in the speech he gave last night? He stood nowhere. He is prepared to be a mem ber of the Government that ring-fences plastic bag, chewing gum and ATM receipt taxes for an environmental fund but he will not support the ring fencing of money that comes from the proceeds of crime for the communities that suffer  most at the hands of the criminals and the drug barons. The Minister's contribution was utterly reprehensible from the point of view of the society he wishes to serve.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Schools Refurbishment.</heading>
        <speech by="#BreedaMoynihanCronin" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
          <p eId="para_851">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise the issue of the dire conditions at Lauragh national school, Killarney, County Kerry. While the postal address is Killarney, the school is situated just outside Kenmare. Lauragh national school is 141 years old and the original roof is still in place. Every year, slates are blown off the roof in stormy weather and temporary repair works have to be carried on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">In November 2001, the board of management of Lauragh national school applied to the Department of Education and Science for major capital improvement works funding to carry out a number of developments at the school. However, when it received no funding, the board of management, in September of this year, went so far as to postpone its application for a school extension for the moment, in an attempt to speed up the grant to repair the roof and make the playground safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">It is a tremendous shame that the school had to take this step in the hope that the roof and playground would be prioritised. It is a damning indictment of the Government and its attitude to the conditions in our schools that this school decided to drop the bulk of its application for funding in the hope that this would expedite funding for the most dangerous aspects of the school building. It is a very poor reflection on the Minister and the Government that, because of spending cutbacks, schools are being forced to prioritise projects even though all of them are very critical to make the school and its grounds a safe place for pupils and staff alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I will describe the condition of the roof. Most of the battens in the roof are rotten, the slate nails are under stress and the slightest pressure can cause slates to be hurtled of the roof and onto the playground below, to the danger of pupils in the school yard This is not just my assessment. These are the words of an engineer who has surveyed the condition of the roof. The roof leaks where there are gaps, there is no felt underlying the slates because of the age of the school and there is no way to apply felt unless the roof is stripped away entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">In conclusion, the engineer reports, the whole roof has reached disintegration point, and the feasible option is to completely strip away and replace the slates and timber with brand new materials. In its present condition, she continues, it is only a matter of time before the leakages become much worse, and more important, falling slates could cause very serious injury. The situation is so grave at present that the insurance company has threatened to withdraw insurance for the school yard unless the area is made safe for children to play in.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">How can the Government justifying denying funding to carry out basic and very essential repairs? How can it justify the exclusion of this work from the school building programme for 2003? Will the Minister give me a commitment this evening that the resources will be provided to have the roof on Lauragh national school replaced immediately and have the playground made safe? The 31 pupils in this small rural school and their teachers and parents deserve answers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Dr. McDaid)</from>
          <p eId="para_857">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to outline to the House the position regarding Lauragh national school, Killarney, County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">Lauragh national school is a co-educational primary school. Enrolments have been decreasing steadily in recent years from 50 pupils in September 1993 to 31 pupils in September 2003. The school has a staffing of principal plus one mainstream assistant, one learning support teacher and one resource teacher. In 1998 the Department of Education and Science provided grant aid in the amount of €49,700 for the provision of a new toilet block at the school. The school has also had a classroom partitioned to provide a teaching area for the learning support and resource teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The board of management of Lauragh national school applied to the Department of Education and Science in November 2001 for an extension to include a library and resource area, a multi-purpose room, including a teachers' staff room, and a utility and storage area. The application also included the re-roofing of the original school building and the extension and development of the school grounds. In September 2003 the board of management informed the Department of  Education and Science that it had decided to postpone its application for an extension for the time being due to the current economic climate. It requested that the school's application for roof works and repairs to the school grounds be included in the capital programme for 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Before investing in capital works at any school, the Department of Education and Science must be satisfied as to the long-term viability of that school. In order to determine the school's viability, factors such as current and projected enrolments, staffing and the demographic trends in the area must be examined. As soon as these issues are determined, the application for the roof works and improvements to the school grounds will be considered for inclusion in the 2004 schools building programme in light of available funding and competing resources. The annual capital programme will provide details of projects for which funding will be made available in 2004.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_861">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the important matter of container freight services between Sligo and Dublin. Last Friday, the Sligo and north-west region was devastated by the news that Iarnród Éireann had decided to discontinue the provision of container freight services on the Sligo-Dublin railway line. It is incomprehensible how such a decision was made as the spatial strategy designated Sligo as the gateway of the north-west. A railway service to Sligo has existed for over 100 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">In the past, there has been substantial under-investment in this line. However, both the previous and present Governments have rectified the trend and the first stage of upgrading of the line with the provision of a continuously welded rail track is almost complete. Yet the board of Iarnród Éireann has now made the ludicrous decision to discontinue the provision of a container freight service on the Sligo-Dublin line.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">We are witnessing a significant increase in road traffic and a considerable component of that increase is due to lorries carrying containers. Apart from the increased wear and tear on the road surface, the risk of major accidents increases exponentially with such traffic. It does not require a genius to work out that transferring some of this container traffic to rail would result in a substantial saving on road surfaces and would also result in an increased level of road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">As a frequent traveller on this railway, I have witnessed at first hand the significant increase in the number of container lorries on the road. This is happening at a time when there is an excellent railway line running alongside the road. This railway line is lying unused for most of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">It surely makes sense for some of this road traffic to be transferred to the railway but in its  misplaced wisdom, Iarnród Éireann has decided to cease the operation of container freight to Sligo at a time when all over Europe railways are investing in and expanding freight services.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">It is becoming increasingly obvious that Iarnród Éireann is incapable of managing its freight service. There is a school of thought that believes the responsibility and development of rail freight should be removed from Iarnród Éireann and set up as a separate business. Railways must be allowed to compete and take some of the traffic back from the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I suggest to the Minister of State that since it is apparent that Iarnród Éireann is unable or unwilling to develop its freight services, open access to a rail network might be considered. Competition is the life blood of commerce and both the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and this Government have demonstrated repeatedly the success of this philosophy. Iarnród Éireann has shown that it wishes to control the monopoly of rail usage but by its actions in depriving the north-west of container services, it seems determined to kill the railways. How can one have faith in this organisation when it decides on such a course of action?</p>
          <p eId="para_868">Everyone in Sligo is angry and upset with this decision. Despite Iarnród Éireann's determination to abolish its freight business, the people of the north-west will not allow this to happen. We do not want our region to suffer either commercially or industrially because of the autocratic decisions of Iarnród Éireann. If it is allowed to persevere with this decision, it will make it harder for industry in Sligo to compete on the national stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I ask the Minister of State to demand a reversal of the appalling decision by Iarnród Éireann and to investigate the opening up of the railways to competition. I ask the rail regulator to ensure that safeguards are put in place so that no major infrastructure such as freight yards or potential land banks on railway-owned property are disposed of. Container rail freight between Sligo and Dublin must not only be continued but requires further development.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesMcDaid" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Dr. McDaid</from>
          <p eId="para_870">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to set out the present position regarding Irish Rail's plans for its freight business. Irish Rail is not exiting the rail freight business. The business strategy is to develop the profitable traffics such as bulk cement, mineral ore concentrates, sugar beet, pulpwood kegs and express parcels.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The collapse of Irish Fertilizer Industries in 2002 dealt a severe blow to the freight element of Irish Rail's operations. This traffic contributed significantly to this aspect of the company's bottom line. The company has indicated that it has now decided, from a business point of view, to  shift the emphasis to point-to-point operation of unit load trains.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">As I outlined recently, Irish Rail is currently in the process of reshaping its freight business to reduce the losses of recent years and focus the business more closely on customer needs. Due to the need for ready access from train to ship and <i>vice versa,</i> this will necessarily be concentrated around the existing facilities available to Irish Rail in the ports of Dublin, Cork and Bellevue in Waterford. In the north-west Irish Rail has significantly upgraded its freight handling capabilities at Ballina and it makes economic sense to exploit this asset as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I am happy to note that as a result of the new approach being taken by Irish Rail, the company has already had some success in securing suitable traffic including the Coillte contract to transport raw timber from the western region of the country direct to Waterford for processing. Other similar types of traffic are being targeted for the future and the company believes it has a marketable service to offer. Among the initiatives being pursued are exploring the scope for joint ventures and private sector participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">In pursuing this course of action, Irish Rail is confident that it can transform the business from a situation where it has lost €16 million in 2002 to one which turns a modest profit before exceptional items, by 2004. With regard to the specifics of the Deputy's concerns, Irish Rail has informed me that it is not withdrawing freight services from the Sligo to Dublin line. In order to improve the profitability of its freight business in the west of Ireland, it decided to rationalise its depot operations at Sligo and to move other operations onto the Dublin to Westport-Ballina line.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Only keg traffic will be withdrawn from the Sligo depot at the end of the year. This traffic is to be relocated to the Longford depot. Rail-based container traffic in Sligo has already been relocated to Ballina arising from the closures on the Sligo line occurring during the recent upgrade of track work.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The current Esso oil and pulpwood traffic will continue to be handled in Sligo. As a result of withdrawing the keg traffic, six staff will be offered redeployment or voluntary severance according to their preferences. In terms of the future of the Sligo depot, Irish Rail is confident that pulpwood traffic will double from early next year. The two trains per week for diesel and central heating oil are continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">Irish Rail is constantly looking at ways to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of its freight operating business as it believes it has a marketable service to offer to customers. Opportunities to develop its business through joint venture arrangements will continue to be pursued. Ultimately the company's financial strategy is to bring its freight business to viability within the shortest possible timeframe.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_879">I ask the Minister of State to carry out a special investigation into the alarmingly high levels of radon gas in the Castleisland and Tralee areas of County Kerry. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. It is colourless and odourless and can only be measured with special equipment. It is formed in the ground by the radioactive decay of uranium, which is present in small quantities in rocks and soils. As a result of it being a gas, radon can move freely through soil, enabling it to enter the atmosphere and seep into buildings. When radon surfaces in the open air it is quickly diluted to harmless levels, but when it enters an enclosed space such as a building, it can sometimes reach unacceptably high concentrations.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Radon mainly gets into buildings through cracks in floors and gaps around pipes and cables. Minor amounts may also come from building materials and domestic water and gas supplies. Once radon enters a house it quickly decays to produce radioactive particles, some of which remain suspended in the air. When inhaled, these particles can be deposited in the airways and attach themselves to lung tissue, giving a radiation dose which may eventually lead to lung cancer. The risk can be significant, depending on how high a radon level one is exposed to, for how long, and whether or not one smokes.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Based on current knowledge it is estimated that for the Irish population as a whole, a lifetime exposure to radon at the reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre carries a risk of about one in 50 of contracting fatal lung cancer. This is twice the risk of death in a road accident. The results of the national survey on radon in domestic dwellings conducted by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland between 1992 and 1999, showed that alarmingly high levels of radon were found in parts of County Kerry, particularly in the Tralee and Castleisland areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Recently, the highest level of radon ever identified in Ireland, or possibly anywhere in the world, at 50,000 becquerels per cubic metre was found in a house in the Castleisland area following a test carried out by the RPII at the householder's request. This is 250 times the recommended level and should have resulted in an immediate and effective response from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The RPII sent a letter to all householders in high radon areas in Castleisland, within the four, 10 km. national grid areas adjoining the town. The institute advised them that it was writing to all householders in the immediate area  because of the very serious health implications of exposure to such high levels of radon and to inform them of what was found. An information pamphlet was enclosed and people were strongly encouraged, if they had not previously done so, to have radon measurements carried out in their houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">While I welcome the initiative by the RPII, I understand that, for a number of reasons, there has been a poor response to its letter. Householders have to apply to the RPII for two detectors for a radon assessment at a total cost of €33. Additional detectors are available on request at a cost of €24 each. Some people are just not good at filling up application forms even if it is in their own interests. Others, such as those depending on social welfare, find the cost prohibitive. All householders in the immediate area of the house in Castleisland should have been provided with a free radon measurement service given that the highest levels of radon gas ever recorded in Ireland were found there. The Minister should immediately put in place arrangements to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">I understand that a public information seminar is being organised in Castleisland. This should be attended by a scientific officer from the RPlI and a Department official with expertise in radon gas. The Government should make grants available to householders to deal with radon gas levels above the recommended level. It can cost anything between €3,000 and €10,000 to carry out corrective action and some householders cannot afford to employ a contractor to carry out the work required. A 50% grant, which was proposed in the past, would be a positive incentive. It is time the Government took this issue seriously. I recently read that a senior Government official admitted that there is a reluctance on the part of the Government to put the necessary resources in place to deal with the issue of radon gas. I call on the Minister to commence a special investigation into the alarmingly high level of radon gas in Castleisland and Tralee. The investigation should include a thorough and wide-ranging survey of radon gas levels in all domestic dwellings and workplaces. Following this survey the Minister should implement the necessary corrective measures to protect those people living and working in these areas from this invisible killer.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_885">Deputy Deenihan has offered a local example of why I feel building regulations are so deficient in this area. My Adjournment motion refers to adequate building regulations. It should, more correctly, refer to effective building regulations. I am sure that in his response the Minister of State will point to existing regulations. We have a problem in implementing even those ineffective measures that are currently in the building regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">No supervision is in place for the installation of radon monitoring or dispersal equipment in houses. Neither is there any testing of the equipment, either prior to the installation or on an ongoing basis once it is installed in a house. Unlike in other jurisdictions, there is no requirement that testing for radon should be part of the conveyancing process. Existing building regulations are deficient in regard to each of these measures. There is a responsibility on the Government to put in place building regulations that would engender confidence in the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Other countries treat the radon gas problem far more seriously. As Deputy Deenihan pointed out, radon is a naturally occurring substance but it is a radioactive substance. It is somewhat fatuous of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to suggest that the response should be for people to open their windows more often, particularly since in the previous Government the Minister of State at the same Department told people to keep their windows shut in the event of radioactive poisoning coming from Sellafield. Radon is not so much a problem in rooms as it comes up from the foundations of houses and gathers under the floorboards. It requires a certain amount of technical expertise to identify the problem and a certain amount of technical infrastructure to make sure that the problem is addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">In Sweden each local authority has a radon protection officer. We have a serious problem in terms of the existence and the build-up of radon. The Government has, unfortunately, not tackled the problem with adequate seriousness. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, which has been referred to by Deputy Deenihan, estimates that 200 deaths per year are caused by radon which is a carcinogen. That is half the number of people who die every year in road accidents. The Government puts a great deal of thought and effort into road safety programmes but nothing like the same degree of effort and thought goes into protection from radon exposure. An actuarial study into road deaths from a number of years ago estimated that the loss to the economy for every death recorded was €1.3 million. A similar study taken now would indicate that the economy is losing out to the extent of €250 million per year because we do not have adequate measures in place in regard to radon. I hope the Minister of State, who no doubt has come with a prepared script, will be able to go back to his senior ministerial colleague and other Members of Government and recommend that measures are at last put in place to avoid the type of occurrences we have seen in Kerry and that I fear can happen elsewhere in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">The RPII has been quite diligent in marking out the blackspots which exist in regard to this risk. The last opportunity I had to speak in this  House on the Adjournment, was to challenge the Government on the need for a repository for radioactive waste. This problem is a similar one but it is even more immediate. The Minister has a responsibility, along with his Government colleagues, to ensure that it is a concern that is met.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_890">I thank the Deputies for raising these issues. The recent discovery of very high radon levels in a house in Castleisland, County Kerry, is clearly a serious matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The Government has been concerned about the issue of radon for some time and has, through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the problem and highlighting public awareness. Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas found in variable amounts in rocks and soil. While it is quickly diluted when it surfaces in the open air, where it enters an enclosed space such as house unacceptably high concentration levels may be reached. Epidemiological studies have shown that radon gas concentrations add to the incidence of lung cancer. While this evidence is derived primarily from studies of miners exposed to radon gas at work, it is supported by the outcome of a number of studies of radon exposure in the home. There is evidence to suggest that long-term exposure to high levels of radon can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer. The incidence is higher among smokers than non-smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The RPII has carried out radon measurements in the house in Castleisland and found that unusually high radon levels were present. I understand from the RPII that the house is built on karstic limestone which is overlain by shale known to contain high uranium concentrations. Karstic limestone contains underground caves and streams which favour the movement and accumulation of radon gas. Remediation work is being undertaken at the house to reduce the radon concentrations present. When this has been completed, additional measurements will be carried out to confirm whether or not the work has been successful. The RPII also carried out radon measurements at two nearby properties. It was found that radon concentrations in both houses concerned were below the 200 becquerels per cubic metre national reference level. This reference level was set in 1990 by the Government and is the level above which radon remediation measures should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">As the Deputy said, the RPII also sent 2,500 letters to all households in the four, 10 km. national grid squares adjoining the town of Castleisland informing them of the levels of radon that had been found. The households were advised to have radon measurements carried out. To date, 400 measurement requests have been  received and radon detectors have been issued. This measurement programme is in addition to that involving 80 homes in which radon measurements were taken in the same four grid squares as part of the national radon survey undertaken by the RPII in the period 1992 to 1999. A further 92 local authority homes in the four grid squares adjoining Castleisland are being measured for radon on the initiative of Kerry County Council. The Government and the RPII have actively encouraged householders in areas designated high radon areas to have their homes measured for radon levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">In February, 2002 my Department published a booklet, Radon in Existing Buildings – Corrective Options, which advised designers, builders and home owners of remediation options to reduce radon in existing houses to or below the national reference level. This booklet gives advice on a number of options including increased ventilation all year round, which is an immediate and inexpensive way to prevent the build-up of radon gas in the home. Ireland was among the first European countries to introduce specific building regulations and related detailed technical guidance on radon prevention in new buildings. To be fair, I must acknowledge that the current regulatory regime was developed on a cross-party basis. Deputy Howlin, when Minister, announced the relevant proposals in May 1997 and these were taken on and implemented by his successor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, when making consolidated building regulations in December 1997. The upgraded regulations apply to new buildings commencing on, or after, 1 July 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Under the 1997 regulatory regime, new houses in high radon areas must incorporate a radon proof membrane and a passive sump in the foundations. If a post-construction survey shows that the radon level is still above the national reference level for houses, the householder has the option of installing a pump to activate the sump at relatively low cost to further reduce radon levels. A high radon area is one in which the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland estimates that 10% or more of existing houses have radon concentrations above the national reference level. In the cases of houses outside high radon areas, the foundations must incorporate a passive sump to cater for situations in which radon can occur sporadically and at random.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">In July 2003, the RPII published the results of a survey of a sample of 90 new houses built under the 1997 regulatory regime at Ennis, County Clare. The results showed a significant reduction in the proportion of houses with radon concentrations above the national reference level from 27% of existing houses in the previous national survey results to 12% in the sample of new houses in Ennis. More significantly, there was a reduction of two thirds in the maximum radon  level recorded in the new houses built in Ennis since mid 1998 compared with the earlier survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">While the Government welcomes the positive effect of the 1997 building regulations and the related technical guidance, it recognises that there is no room for complacency. Action is required to make the radon prevention measures for new houses even more effective. In this regard, proposals for strengthened technical guidance were published last July. The proposals take account of recommendations made in the Ennis survey report. Copies of these proposals, together with the relevant press statement, have been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The key features of the strengthened technical guidance may be summarised as follows. First, membranes should be certified as radon proof by an independent third party such as the Irish Agrement Board of the National Standards Authority of Ireland. Second, the membranes should be very carefully installed and should be protected from damage once installed. Third, radon levels in the new houses should be checked after completion and occupation of the new house to see if activation of the radon sump, by installation of a pump, is called for. Finally, the outlet pipes for piping from the radon sumps should be capped and marked with an identification marking or marker plating to prevent confusion with rain water piping.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The draft technical guidance also draws attention to new and separate regulatory controls on radon protection in buildings which are workplaces, namely, those contained in the Radiological Protection Act 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000. This sets a radon limit of 400 becquerels per cubic metre for workplaces. Com ments on the draft guidance have been invited from the general public and the construction industry within a three-month period ending on 30 October 2003. I will very much welcome any specific comments from Members of the House. I assure Deputies that all comments received will be carefully considered by my Department in consultation with the building regulations advisory body. The definitive technical guidance on radon prevention in new buildings, including new houses, will be published early in the new year. Under the Building Control Act 1990, compliance with building regulations is primarily the responsibility of the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Enforcement of building regulations is, by law, the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities. Enforcement of the ionising radiation order mentioned above is, primarily, the responsibility of the RPII.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">I assure Members that I have taken note of the points they have made. The Department takes the issue of radon very seriously and will continue to publicise and heighten public awareness of it. The RPII and the Government will continue to encourage householders in high radon areas to have radon measurements carried out. Specifically, I note Deputy Deenihan's suggestion that free measurement devices be distributed. I take note also of Deputy Boyle's feeling that supervision and testing are lacking and that testing should be part of the conveyancy system. I will pass the Deputies' comments on when I return to the Department. People with views on the matter have an opportunity to submit them by the end of the month.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 October 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">Ireland currently has among the highest proportions of lone-parent families within the EU, with over 11% of households headed by a lone parent. Up to 45% are in employment, a low percentage compared to other countries. For most lone parents, the one parent family payment is their main or only source of income. The duration of nearly half of these payments is for more than eight years. Long-term dependency on social welfare payments increases the likelihood of being at risk of poverty and in 2001, some 42.9% of lone parents in Ireland had a level of income which put them in the "at risk of poverty" category. The children of lone parents also comprise a high proportion of children at risk of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">As employment is the best way out of poverty, lone parents face a heightened poverty risk, as they have to be the main breadwinner and main carer at the same time. One of the objectives of the one-parent family payment is to facilitate lone parents in obtaining employment as an alternative to welfare dependency, while at the same time enabling them to remain in the home if they so wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I have given a commitment in my Department's statement of strategy to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. The main purpose of the review is to establish the extent to which the scheme may be acting as a disincentive to recipients taking up employment, and to making the transition to full-time employment, greater self sufficiency and a better overall standard of living for them and their children.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_20">Account will be taken in the review of the research carried out to date, not least the review of the one parent family payment, published by my own Department in September 2000, an OECD study in which Ireland participated, due to be launched on 4 November next, and the policies and programmes pursued in other EU countries as set out in their recently published national action plans on social inclusion. The process will also include my Department and other relevant Departments participating with the Crisis Preg nancy Agency on a committee, due to commence early next year, which will examine all the issues surrounding parenting alone, including income support and employment. The review process will also contribute to the special initiative on ending child poverty under Sustaining Progress.</summary>

          <p eId="para_908">At end of December 2002, there were 188,350 people receiving an old age contributory or retirement pension. A recent actuarial review of the social insurance fund, undertaken by the Government Actuary Department in the UK, presented that the number of recipients of these pensions will increase to 255,000 by 2011 and 321,000 by 2016. The increase will, to some extent, be balanced by a reduction in the number of people receiving the old age non-contributory pension. The numbers receiving this pension are down over 20% in the past ten years which reflects improved social insurance coverage and increased labour force participation, particularly among women.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">In common with other European countries, the population of Ireland is ageing as a result of a combination of increasing life expectancy and a declining birth rate. The decline in the birth rate is relatively recent and this, coupled with the effects of high emigration for much of the period up to the 1990s, has resulted in Ireland having the lowest proportion of older people in the EU – 11.2% aged 65 and over, as compared to the current EU average of 16.1%.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The proportion of older people in Ireland will remain at much the same level for roughly the next ten years after which it is projected to increase rapidly to 15% in 2021, 19% in 2031 and 28% in 2056. A similar situation exists in relation to the numbers at work relative to the number of pensioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Given that the situation will remain relatively stable for the next ten years or so, no particular measures are planned in that timescale. However, the Government is making preparations, through the national pensions reserve fund, to part fund pensions costs from 2025 onwards.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_22">As the Deputy will be aware, pensions have been an important issue at EU level over the past year or so. This is not surprising given that the challenges facing pensions systems are more immediate for other member states. The EU has  been assessing national pensions systems under agreed objectives in the area of adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation. In this regard, a joint EU Commission and Council report published earlier this year considered that Ireland has made good progress in ensuring both financial sustainability in our pensions system.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23">The report considered that the public system therefore appears to be, in broad terms, financially sustainable despite projected major increases in future pensions expenditure. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.</summary>

          <p eId="para_914">I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 122 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The national action plan reflects the intensive policy development that occurred over the past two years including the formulation of the revised national anti-poverty strategy, Building an Inclusive Society, and the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. All of these are the product of intensive consultation with interested parties. The trends identified, to be addressed in the plan, the analysis of progress since the previous plan, the strategies, targets and measures to be adopted, the structures in place to monitor and advise on implementation, and the specific initiatives for future policy development, all come together to form a clear, comprehensive and coherent basis for combating poverty and social exclusion over the next two years and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">Annex A.3.2 details the €17.4 billion which will be spent this year alone on social inclusion measures, with expenditure on a similar scale occurring in subsequent years. As for specifics, the plan contains many more specific targets than the previous plan.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_24">The fact that much of the content is not new to those involved in the process is simply a function of the transparent approach adopted, resulting in most of the key policy initiatives appearing in the revised NAPs, in Sustaining Progress and in other relevant strategies in the preceding year. It is also the case that the current economic downturn has affected the pace at which further progress can  prudently be made, an experience being shared by all member states. However, the concerns expressed and policies proposed during the extensive consultative process are set out in the report on the consultation, which we published with the national action plan, and will be fully taken into account in further policy and programme development.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_25">Ending child poverty is a key priority in the plan and is also the subject of a special initiative for intensive policy development under Sustaining Progress. My Department, working together with other relevant Departments and agencies and the social partners, will be centrally involved in this task.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26">Consistent poverty among children has more than halved in the four year period from 1997 to 2001, falling from 15.3% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001 or 74,000 children. The figure of 90,000 children in consistent poverty, which is drawn from a policy document published recently by Barnardos, is based on 2000 data when the level of consistent poverty amongst children was at 8%.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27">Our specific target in this area is to reduce the numbers of children who are consistently poor to below 2% by 2007 and, if possible, eliminate consistent poverty for children. Given the progress made to date, this target is clearly attainable and is one I am determined to do all that I can to reach.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_28">I am confident that the strategy to end child poverty already set out in the national action plan and the actions to supplement this under the special initiative will enable the target to be reached.</summary>

For example, if engaged under a contract for service, i.e. self-employed, for up to three days per week, unemployment benefit may be payable for the remainder of the week provided that all qualifying conditions are satisfied.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31">Where a person is not eligible for unemployment benefit, arrangements are already in place where a self-employed person, whose overall income falls below the rate of payment appropriate to his or her family size, can qualify for an unemployment assistance payment, which is means tested.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_32">In assessing means, account is taken of net income which the person may reasonably expect to receive in the next year, after all expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out the business are deducted. In this context, there are currently 1,670 self-employed people receiving an average payment of €130.83 unemployment assistance per week.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33">The national employment action plan is the Department's principal intervention measure to support and encourage unemployed people to progress towards employment. It is particularly focused on early intervention, with those receiving unemployment payments for six months being referred to FÁS for assessment of the progression path most suited to their needs. This early intervention helps prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. Also, the back to work enterprise allowance scheme is available to the most disadvantaged social welfare recipients, including those unemployed for five years or more, who wish to take up self-employment for at least 20 hours per week.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_34">I have no proposals to make changes to the unemployment benefit scheme at this time.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_922">The Department's modernisation action plan is a detailed document containing some 100 commitments that make up a challenging agenda for the Department over the course of Sustaining Progress. This is available on the  website of the Department of Finance and I am also arranging for a copy to be sent to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">While the plan must be considered in its totality, five key priority areas have been identified. These involve the use of new technology; greater flexibility in the way services are delivered; implementation of a new control programme; a range of changes in the HR area including greater use of competitive promotions; and development of better financial management and information systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Priorities under the heading of new technology include implementation of the Department's new service delivery model, SDM, and associated projects. The SDM involves the development of a new generation of IT systems which facilitates customer-centred services and also supports the e-government strategy. The inter-linked modernisation projects such as the civil registration modernisation programme, the public service broker, REACH inter-agency messaging service and the development of the public service identity complement the development of the SDM.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">In the area of flexible delivery of service the key element is the phased localisation of the one parent family payment scheme. In effect, this means that the administration of the scheme will move from one central office to the Department's local office network. By end-2004, it is planned that up to 19 local offices will be engaged in this work; the offices in question are being selected to cover a high proportion of one parent family payment claims. This initiative will result in a better, more personalised service to the customer, faster decision-making, readier access to local support programmes and enhanced control measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">In addition, the enhanced capability flowing from the Department's technology development agenda will field opportunities for significant process improvement, greater flexibility in the deployment of work and resources and, consequently, productivity gains.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The third priority is control. The Department's existing control strategy entails the use of a mix of measures to minimise risks of fraud and eliminate incorrect payments. Implementation of the new control strategy, involving greater emphasis on risk assessment and risk management and a more focused control approach, will provide for a more effective and efficient allocation of resources with staff deployed and budgets expended on more effective control activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">A number of developments in the Department's human resources strategy are reflected in the action plan. Promotion policy is one of the main elements of this strategy. As indicated in the plan, the aim is to move towards a higher proportion of competition-based promotions. The adoption of best practice in this regard will lead to a more performance and accountability-based management culture.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_35">In the area of financial management the Civil Service management information framework – MIF – project aims at ensuring better decision-making about allocation of resources, better management of resources once allocated and greater transparency and accountability for the use of resources.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36">This Department has had financial reporting systems in place since 1998 and, as part of the MIF project, is now working on the development and implementation of a number of management information related and accounting projects. A key element of the current phase of the project is the development and roll-out of a new style of comprehensive, integrated management reports which will support the Department in meeting the objectives of the MIF project.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">The overall aim of the action plan is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department across the full range of its operations, service delivery and internal management systems. I am confident that the Department will deliver on the commitments in the plan and continue to maintain its leading role in the development of better customer service generally.</summary>

          <p eId="para_930">The administrative and other arrangements needed to bring about the automatic payment of child benefit in the cases cited by the Deputy have already been developed and a significant number of families have already benefited by receiving child benefit payments automatically in respect of their newly born children.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">This has been made possible through developments in my Department and related developments affecting the capture and use of life event data.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The first element in the change programme underpinning these arrangements is my Department's service delivery modernisation programme which is designed to facilitate a more proactive and integrated approach to service delivery. The re-design of the child benefit computer system represents the first phase of this modernisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">The second element is the modernisation of the civil registration service and, in particular, the computerisation of records of births, marriages and deaths, which is being undertaken on a joint basis by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_38">The third element is the ability to use electronic birth registration data for claim purposes.  This involved the development of an inter-agency messaging service, IAMS, by the REACH agency, which will facilitate the sharing of life event data with other Departments and agencies. The IAMS now enables my Department to use electronic birth registration data for child benefit claim purposes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">These projects are key building blocks underpinning the integration of public service delivery and e-government objectives of providing more convenient access to services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_40">Under the new arrangements, the General Registrar's Office, which is responsible for life event data, notifies my Department when the birth of a child is registered. My Department issues a personal public service number, PPSN, in respect of the child which will be the person's unique identifier in accessing public services. In the case of a first child, the mother is issued with a partially-completed child benefit application form and asked to complete the balance which will include details of her preferred method of payment. In the case of a second or subsequent child, the new child will be added automatically to the existing claim and payment will be issued automatically. The mother will also be notified, by post, that payment has been issued in respect of the new child.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_41">These arrangements are already in operation in the Cork area and will be expanded, progressively, as the on-line registration of births is extended to other areas.</summary>

      <b>Ms Lynch</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      her plans to review pensions legislation in three years' time to decide whether employers should be obliged to contribute to personal retirement savings accounts; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
      [24209/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_935">Under the new pensions framework established by the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, certain obligations have already been placed on employers to the extent that, with effect from 15 September last, they are required to provide access to personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, for employees if they do not operate a pension scheme or exclude some employees from a pension scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_43">An essential aim of this new pensions framework is to increase pensions coverage from its current level of just over 50% towards the agreed national pensions policy initiative, NPPI, target of 70% of the workforce over age 30. All parties to the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Pro gress, have agreed to co-operate to promote improvements aimed at achieving this target.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_44">Progress towards this target will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by my Department and the Pensions Board using data collected from a combination of sources. One source will be the data the Pensions Board is collecting on a quarterly basis from PRSA providers with regard to PRSA contracts and contributions. In addition, the Pensions Board keeps a register of occupational pension schemes and the numbers of members concerned.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_45">Another source will be future CSO surveys along the lines of the 2002 CSO pension survey which established a benchmark against which future progress can be measured. That survey gives data on pensions coverage of employees and the self-employed broken down under various headings including sex, age, marital status, economic sector, occupation and hours of work. A survey under these headings will be repeated in the first quarter of 2004, 2005 and 2006. A more detailed survey will be carried out in the fourth quarter of 2005, the content of which is under discussion with the CSO at present.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_46">All these data will feed into a report which, under the pensions legislation, is required by September 2006. In the event that that report indicates a significant failure to increase pension coverage, I will consider all options open to me.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">In relation to the option outlined by the Deputy of obliging employers to contribute to PRSAs, while clearly there would be a need to balance the costs of compulsion with the benefits it could achieve, I have often said that measures along these lines would have to be very seriously considered, in due course, if the current approach does not succeed.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Neville</b>
      asked the

      the length of time it takes to process and decide claims, on average, in each of the social welfare schemes; the length of time it takes for each scheme to go into payment once a decision is made; and the length of time, on average, it takes for arrears to issue.

          <p eId="para_937">My Department is committed to providing quality customer service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and entitlements issued as quickly as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply. These conditions vary from scheme to scheme and may include establishment of the customer's social insurance record, an assessment of means, where appropriate, or an examination to ensure that medical conditions are fulfilled.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_48">On average the length of time taken to award  claims for disability benefit, the unemployment schemes, child benefit and family income supplement ranges from two to three weeks. Claims for old age, widowed and invalidity pensions take an average of six to eight weeks to process and cases where the conditions of entitlement are more complex, such as payments for carers, one parent families and disability allowance cases, currently require between ten and seventeen weeks on average to finalise.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_49">Details of the average clearance times for new claims for the month of August 2003, and year to date including August, on a scheme by scheme basis are in the table which will be circulated in the Official Report.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">Once a claim is decided payment is normally made within one week. For the year 2003 to date, the average time to issue pension arrears is 2.5 weeks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">The over-riding consideration in processing claims is to ensure that customers receive their correct entitlement and decisions are not taken until all appropriate information is received.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">Improving customer service is a priority on my Department's agenda. In relation to clearance times, challenging performance targets have been set for all of the main schemes and these are published and reported on.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">My Department is also introducing a major initiative to improve customer service which will use modern technology and business models to focus on meeting customer needs. A key element of the modernisation programme is to provide a pro-active service to customers where the nature of the scheme and the qualification criteria allow. The programme will also facilitate integration of services and greater efficiency which will have beneficial effects on the processing of other claims.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">The first phase of this system was implemented for child benefit late last year and has enabled a radical re-engineering of the child benefit application process by dovetailing with the computerised birth registration data flowing from the modernisation of the civil registration service. As a result of these changes, child benefit will be awarded and put into payment automatically for second and subsequent children born to child benefit recipients. Partially completed claim forms will be issued automatically in other cases for signature and for instructions on how payment is to be made.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_55">This service delivery modernisation programme will be extended to other schemes on a progressive basis. It will be some years before the benefits of the programme are fully realised and I am concerned to ensure that service levels are maintained and improved where possible in the meantime. To this end, my Department is engaged in an ongoing process to ensure that existing resources are prioritised to the greatest extent possible on service delivery areas.</summary>

          <p eId="para_994">I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 127 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme was introduced in 1990. The scheme was designed to provide assistance towards the cost of school clothing and footwear for children attending primary and post-primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards. It replaced the former public assistance footwear scheme, which was introduced in 1944, as well as taking over supplementary welfare allowance exceptional needs payments made in respect of school clothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">A person may qualify for payment of a back to school clothing and footwear allowance if he-she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment, is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and has household income at or below certain set levels.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_57">Under the scheme an allowance of €80 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from two to 11 years and an allowance of €150 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years. Since 1990, the payment rates for the scheme have increased by 192% in the case of children aged 12 years or more and by 152% in the case of those below 12 years. In the same period, the cost of clothing and footwear, as  measured in the consumer price index, has fallen by some 25% and the levels of child benefit have increased very substantially.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">In relation to the adequacy or otherwise of the payment rates, my Department established a working group to undertake a review of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme as part of its expenditure review programme. The working group is undertaking a fundamental examination of all aspects of the scheme, including the rates of payment as well as the income limits, the means test, timing of payments, eligibility criteria and other issues. This review is almost complete. I will consider any changes to the scheme in the light of the recommendations of the working group.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_999">I intend to bring forward a number of legislative initiatives over the coming months. Two Bills have been prioritised for progression in the current Dáil session, namely, the Social Welfare Bill 2003 and the Civil Registration Bill 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">The Social Welfare Bill 2003 will provide for the implementation of budget 2004 increases in social welfare payments and any other changes which would be scheduled to take effect from January 2004. It is my intention to introduce this Bill to the House in the first week in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">The Civil Registration Bill 2003 was published in July last. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the civil registration service, an t-Seirbhís um Chlarú Sibhialta. This will entail the re-organisation and modernisation of the system of registration of births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths. The Bill further provides for the extension of the system to decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage granted by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">Civil registration provides both a record and evidence of vital events in relation to persons living in the State, and a basic continuous source of information about the population. It is estimated that, currently, approximately 110,000 life events – births, adoptions, etc. – are registered, some 500,000 certificates produced and 1.2 million searches and inquiries carried out each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The current system was established 150 years ago, and the registration procedures have remained largely unchanged, despite significant demographic changes and technological developments. The new system is part of a joint project between my Department and the Department of Health and Children to modernise and update the current system through the use of modern technology.</p>

          <p eId="para_1005">The use of advertising is important in ensuring that citizens are aware of their social welfare entitlements and are notified about improvements and changes affecting their payments and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Expenditure on advertising in 2001 was €1,519,053. The main advertising campaigns during 2001 were in respect of the introduction of the euro and also the Budget 2002 payment increases. In 2002, advertising expenditure was €1,319,238. Advertising during 2002 included three information campaigns relating to the promotion of the farm assist scheme among low income farmers; the promotion of awareness of the personal public service number and its use as the key to accessing public services; and the Budget 2003 information campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">Advertising expenditure in 2003 to date has amounted to €243,095.06. My Department's expenditure on public relations consultancy in 2002 was €6,534. There was no expenditure of this nature in 2001 or in 2003 to date. There was no expenditure on marketing during the period 2001 to 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">The living alone allowance is an additional payment of €7.70 per week made to people aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who are living alone.

          <p eId="para_1018">The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over. It is also available to carers and to people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. It applies to travel within the State and cross-Border journeys between here and Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">Under the free travel scheme a person aged 66 or over who is married or co-habiting is entitled to a free travel pass which allows a spouse or partner to accompany him or her free of charge when travelling on public transport services. The Department has now amended its free travel scheme guidelines to extend the same benefits to same-sex cohabiting couples as previously applied to opposite-sex cohabiting couples. This amendment was introduced to comply with the Equal Status Act 2000. The Department is now examining other non-statutory schemes to ensure that they are fully in compliance with the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">The free travel scheme, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland concessionary travel scheme, provides free travel on cross-Border routes for pass holders of both jurisdictions. This scheme applies to cross-Border journeys and not to travel exclusively within either jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Implementation of an all-Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island will require detailed discussions and agreements with the relevant authorities and transport providers on both sides of the Border. Preparatory work on this proposal will be commencing shortly.</p>

This report recommended that member states should establish a senior euro pass card which would entitle older people to concessions on various services, including travel, cultural and social activities. The matter has not, however, been pursued further.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1023">The pre-budget submission of CORI is one of many submissions I have received and which are being considered in the context of the forthcoming 2004 budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The submission sets out the views of CORI on the priorities which it considers require to be addressed by Government in the forthcoming budget across the range of policy areas which impact on poverty and social exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The submission argues that the effect of Government budgetary decisions relating to tax reductions, social welfare increases and other factors has been to increase income inequality in Irish society. I believe, however, that budgetary decisions must be viewed in the context of the wider economic policies which have been pursued by this Government in recent years. These policies have seen very significant increases in employment levels; reductions in unemployment and in particular in long-term unemployment; heavy investment in infrastructure and in public services; and substantial increases in real terms in household incomes at all income levels.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_63">This is reflected most clearly in the sharp decrease we have seen in consistent poverty over recent years.

Consistent poverty has fallen from 15.1% in 1994 to some 5.2% in 2001. The Government is committed to reducing consistent poverty to below 2%, and ideally eliminating it, by 2007.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1028">I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 120 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards, provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement relates to the amount of rent a person may incur. Each health board sets a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur, taking the household size and other relevant circumstances into account. This is to ensure that the rent is reasonable and that the health board is not subsidising the cost of overly large or overly expensive accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">As the Deputies are aware, I introduced regulations on 22 November 2002 which provided for holding the maximum rent levels until the end of December 2003 at the values that had been set by the health boards at that time. Concern was expressed at the time that the new regulations could have an adverse impact on social welfare recipients' ability to secure accommodation in the private rented sector and could lead to people becoming homeless. In fact, there has been an increase of over 6,000 in the number of recipients since the regulations were introduced. This significant increase of over 11% in the number of rent supplement recipients since last November shows that the anticipated adverse impact did not occur.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_66">I am not aware of any individual being made homeless as a result of the regulations. I am aware of cases where rents were reduced to the prescribed levels and other cases where no increase in rent was sought by the landlord.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">The privately owned rent index, as published by the Central Statistics Office, shows that rent levels have been falling consistently since April 2002. In light of all of this evidence, I am satisfied that the action taken has not had an adverse effect on the position of social welfare recipients in securing private rented accommodation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">The legislation governing the payment of rent supplements continues to provide the health boards with scope to deal with exceptional cases. To date, my Department has been notified of some 890 instances where the health board availed of this discretion in dealing with cases involving rents which exceed the prescribed limits. Many of these cases involve people with special housing requirements resulting from medical conditions or difficult social circumstances.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">Setting higher maximum rent limits than are justified by the open market would distort the rental market, leading to a general rise in rent levels that would disadvantage people on low incomes. Consideration is currently being given to the issue of maximum rent levels beyond the end of this year when the current regulation expires. In this regard, a decision will be taken in the near future following consideration of the exceptional cases as notified by the health boards, updated information from the Central Statistics Office and submissions which have been sought from the health boards.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_70">The policies pursued by the Government over recent years in combating unemployment and in  reducing the level of consistent poverty have brought about a significant improvement, in real terms, in the situation of people on lower incomes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">The Government's ongoing priorities in this regard are reflected in the approach set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, published in February 2002, and in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion launched in July of this year. These contain ambitious targets across the range of policy areas which impact on poverty and social exclusion, including social welfare payments, education, health, employment, and housing and accommodation. Notably, they include a key target of raising the lowest social welfare rate to €150 in 2002 terms by 2007.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">The achievement of the targets contained in the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy, NAPS, and in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion will build on the achievements to date in creating a more just and inclusive society, a goal we share with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and other like minded organisations, and look forward to working with them to achieve it.</summary>

These emerging savings are due almost entirely to the performance of the live register being better than had been expected. The figures in the Book of Estimates were based on a projected average live register of 179,000 whereas the latest indications are that the average for the year will outturn at around 174,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_1041">I assume the Deputy is referring to the comments of the Combat Poverty Agency on the report by Dr. Virpi Timonen of TCD entitled, Irish Social Expenditure in a Comparative International Context, which the agency recently published and to the position in Ireland regarding relative poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">This report analyses Ireland's level of social expenditure by comparison to other OECD countries. It is necessary to point out, however, that there are a range of factors that need to be taken into account in making such comparisons. These factors are that the old age dependency ratio in Ireland is approximately a third lower than the EU average, requiring much lower expenditure on pensions and health care; Ireland relies fully on occupational and private pension provision to provide supplementary pensions. A majority of members of these schemes have not reached pension age and expenditure under these schemes is not fully taken into account for social protection expenditure purposes by EUROSTAT; Ireland's current level of unemployment is among the lowest in the EU; social expenditure is usually given as a proportion of GDP which includes a high proportion of repatriated profits – a significant factor in our case; the actual income available, GNP, is up to 15% less; and Ireland is financing a much higher level of public investment in infrastructure running to over 6% of GDP in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The ageing of the population will result in significant increases in expenditure on pensions, health services and care services in the medium term. It is for that reason that the Pension Reserve Fund, which has already reached €8.4 billion, is being set up to help meet the growing future pension liabilities and ease the burden on future generations of workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The main aim for those of working age is to continue to increase employment participation and quality jobs, the best security against poverty and social exclusion. This requires maintaining economic competitiveness and an active labour market policy to encourage and facilitate employment and to increase employability through education and training. Sound economic and fiscal policies are being pursued to maintain competitiveness and services and supports to improve employment participation and employability are in place and are being further developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">The growing levels of employment participation, the low levels of long-term unemployment and the general increasing standards of living provide clear evidence that these policies are working.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_73">The widening gap between the incomes of the majority and those on social welfare and on low incomes generally are the product of the recent  rapid economic growth we have been experiencing.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">This gap will narrow progressively as benefit and pension rates increase in real terms, access to services and their quality continue to improve, growing numbers qualify for social insurance and supplementary pensions, and as expenditure on health and other services for an ageing population increase.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">We are prudently using the window of opportunity currently presented by the favourable demographic position to provide for the future as well as the present, especially through the Pension Reserve Fund, the high level of infra-structural investment and our investment and development of our young people and our workforce which provide our greatest security for the present and future. The outcome will be secure, financially sustainable social provision based on a strong economy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">I am having the Combat Poverty Agency report and its comments on the report carefully studied and the findings will be fully taken into account in future policy development. I do not consider, however, that current realities warrant the radical rethink of social provision the agency suggests.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1047">The report of the Independent Estimates Review Committee to the Minister for Finance, which was published in December 2002, made a number of specific recommendations in relation to my Department's proposed 2003 Estimates, namely, a reduction in the amount sought by my Department for administrative expenses; a phasing out of the back to work allowance, BTWA, and a discontinuation of summer payments in respect of the back to education allowance, BTEA, schemes; a speeding up of the implementation of the employment action plan whereby persons on the live register are offered supports to find employment or training; changes to the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme; reduction in the financial allocations sought to fund the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, and the Family Support Agency, FSA; and greater control savings across schemes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_78">In the light of the recommendations by the committee on administration expenses, measures have been put in place to reduce expenditure on  administration while maintaining the focus on high priority areas.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">In relation to the BTWA scheme, the scheme was not phased out but refocused on those who were on the live register for five years or more and on other groups who had particular difficulty in accessing the labour market such as those on disability or invalidity payments. Approximately 3,200 new persons have joined the BTWA scheme in the period from January 2003 to the end of September compared to 9,900 in 2002 as a whole. It should be noted that persons who were in receipt of the BTWA prior to last January were not affected in any way by the introduction of the new arrangements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">In line with the committee's recommendation, summer payments under the BTEA scheme were discontinued this year in respect of BTEA recipients who had been in receipt of unemployment payments immediately prior to commencing their education courses. These recipients were eligible to claim unemployment payments during the summer period if they fulfilled the usual conditions for receipt of these payments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">The committee also identified savings arising from a speeding up of the employment action plan whereby persons on the live register are offered employment supports by my Department and FÁS. The necessary arrangements were put in place in the Dublin area last May and continue to be progressively rolled out across the rest of the country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">In relation to the SWA scheme, the committee recommended that the individual rent contribution for rent supplement should be raised to €12 per week and identified other savings arising in the context of speedier processing of asylum cases. The rent contribution was increased to the figure recommended with effect from the beginning of this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">The committee identified savings from the amounts sought in funding for the MABS and the FSA services. While the recommendations of the committee were partly reflected in the Abridged Estimates allocation, the services in question, following additional allocations in budget 2004, have the necessary resources to function fully this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">My Department has a comprehensive control programme which includes checks and reviews carried out on a regular and targeted basis to ensure that social welfare payments are only received by those who are entitled to them and that employers and the self-employed are fulfilling their PRSI obligations. Reorganisation of Department structures and ongoing technology developments have combined to facilitate a more co-ordinated approach to control and consequent improvement in the effectiveness of our control programmes.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1049">There are almost 103,000 people receiving an Irish non-contributory old age or widowed person's pension. Of these, 10,700 – 10% – also receive a British retirement pension. British pension rates in these cases are less than the maximum rate of non-contributory pension payable in this country. As a result, the people concerned have an entitlement to Irish pension to, in effect, top up their British pension to the level of Irish non-contributory pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The rate paid in respect of Irish non-contributory pension to people with British pensions has to be adjusted to take account of changes in the rate of their British pension. In this regard, there is a legal obligation on pensioners to notify the Department in the event of changes in their means for whatever reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">My Department has an ongoing claim review and control programme in place for all social welfare schemes, including pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">In the calendar years 2002 and 2003 to date, some 932 pensioners with British retirement pensions have had their non-contributory pensions reduced following claim reviews, largely as a consequence of increases in their British pensions. It should be noted that the overall income position of these pensioners has been maintained, as their Irish pension reductions arose directly as a result of corresponding increases in their other means.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">While changes in exchange rates themselves do not lead to initiation of claim reviews by my Department, they must be taken into account when the case is being reviewed. For non-EMU European states, including the UK, the Department continues to use the conversion mechanism provided for under Article 107 of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 574/72 on social security for migrant workers. Under this mechanism, the conversion rate used for pensions purposes is derived from the average of the daily exchange rates in the first month of a quarter. This rate is then used in all conversions during the course of the succeeding quarter. Alternatively, the conversion rate applicable to the next succeeding quarter is used if it is more beneficial to the pensioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">The weekly value of the British pension income expressed in euro is included in a revised assessment of their means from this and other sources. Where the revised assessment of means affects the rate of pension to which they are entitled under the legislation, a revised decision on their entitlement is given by a deciding officer. They are notified of the new decision and of their right of appeal to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p>

          <p eId="para_1056">The draft EU constitutional treaty sets out in a clear and readable text the proposed rules which would govern the Union in the future. The draft will now be subject to debate and discussion with a view to repealing all of the previous treaties of the EU and consolidating them into the proposed single constitutional treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">Article 3 of the draft treaty sets out the Union's objectives, and paragraph 3 includes specific references to combating social exclusion and promoting social and economic cohesion. These are the goals which we have already been working towards, particularly through the open method of co-ordination of policies at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Article 4 guarantees free movement of persons, goods and services within the EU. Article 13(2) provides that the Union will share competence with the member states in the area of social policy – for aspects defined in Part III.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Article III-21 requires the Council of Ministers to adopt measures necessary to provide freedom of movement of workers and their families within the Union. To this end, the Council is required to make arrangements to secure the aggregation of entitlements to, and payment of, social security benefits. This article replaces similar provisions set out in Article 42 of the current treaty. However, a move from unanimity to qualified majority voting is proposed for decisions by the Council under this article. Ireland is not in favour of this change as such decisions may have serious financial consequences for individual member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">The articles relating to social policy are contained in Part III, section 2, of the draft treaty, that is, Articles III-103 to III-115 inclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Article III-103 sets out the objectives of the Union and member states in regard to social policy and corresponds to Article 136 of the current treaty. The objectives set out include proper social protection, dialogue between the social partners and the combating of exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Article III-104 lists the fields in which the Union shall support and complement the activities of the member states. These include: social security and social protection of workers; the combating of social exclusion; and the modernisation of social protection systems.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_87">The article also provides that European laws or framework laws may establish measures designed  to encourage co-operation between member states, for example, through initiatives aimed at improving knowledge and developing exchanges of information. Such laws shall not affect the right of member states to define the fundamental principles of their social security systems and must not significantly affect the financial equilibrium thereof. This article contains provisions similar to those in Article 137 of the current Treaty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Articles III-105 and III-106 provide that the Commission shall promote consultation of the social partners at Union level and that before submitting proposals in the social policy field, the Commission shall consult the social partners on the possible direction of Union action. If the social partners so desire, the dialogue between them may lead to contractual relations including agreements. These articles correspond to the existing Articles 138 and 139.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">Article III-107 corresponds to Article 140 of the current treaty in that it provides that the Commission shall encourage co-operation between the member states and facilitate the co-ordination of their action in particular matters, including those relating to social security.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">Article III-110 obliges the Commission to produce an annual report on progress in achieving the objectives set out in Article III-103. Article III-111 provides for the establishment of the social protection committee and sets out its functions. These articles correspond to Articles 143 and 144, respectively, of the current treaty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">Article III-112 obliges the Commission to include a separate chapter on social developments within the Union in its annual report to the European Parliament and mirrors the current Article 145.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">Articles III-113, III-114 and III-115 relate to the European Social Fund and repeat the provisions already contained in the existing Articles 146, 147 and 148.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">I welcome the strong provision made in the draft constitution on social issues in relation to values, objectives and competence at EU level. Member states do wish, however, to largely retain competence for social policy at national level. This is due to the resources involved and the differing priorities they may have in the social sphere given their values, traditions, culture, social problems and level of economic development.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1064">The report to which the Deputy  refers, Irish Social Expenditure in a Comparative International Context, by Virpi Timonen, compares social expenditure in Ireland with that of other European and developed countries. As in most other countries, old age expenditure in Ireland accounts for the largest part of social protection expenditure. However, at 25%, this is significantly less than the EU average of 46%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The main reason for this discrepancy is that the proportion of people aged 65 and over in Ireland as a proportion of the working age population, aged 15 to 64, was a third lower than the EU average and this gap is projected to continue for at least the next decade. The projection for 2010 is an increase of just 0.5% up to 17.3% for Ireland and a 3% increase for the EU 15 up to 27.3%, which by then will leave a 10% gap.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">A second key reason relates to the historic development of pensions in Ireland. Social insurance was extended to all income earners over recent decades, which means that a high proportion relative to other countries have to rely on social assistance pensions or have no State pension because their means are too high. Ireland, unlike most EU countries, relies fully on occupational and private provision to provide supplementary pension cover. On the other hand, coverage of occupational and private pensions in Ireland is still around 50% and the aim is to increase that coverage to 70% as recommended by the Pensions Board. Expenditure of this kind on private pensions may not be fully captured in the social protection statistics compiled by EUROSTAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">The current situation as it applies to the aged will change significantly in the decades ahead. The ageing of the Irish population will mean that the gap between our old age dependency ratio and that of the EU 15 will close progressively. The vast majority of those retiring will qualify for non-means tested pensions under social insurance as a result of the progressive extension of coverage in recent decades. By the late 2020s, very few pensioners will have to rely on social assistance. Many occupational and personal pension schemes will have matured and an increasing proportion of pensioners will have supplementary pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The Government's objective is to increase social welfare pensions in real terms and the target level is €200 by 2007. We will also increase the amount payable for pensioner spouses currently in receipt of qualified adult allowance to the full non-contributory pension rate and implement improvements in the widow's/ widower's pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">To ensure the financial sustainability of the schemes, considerable resources are being set aside in the pension reserve fund, which already stands at €8.4 billion, to meet the growing liabilities arising from the increasing numbers of pensioners and the real increases in pension payments. A major campaign is under way to increase supplementary pension cover to the target level of 70% of income earners, mainly with PRSAs.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_94">Other services required for the elderly including care services, health, appropriate housing and accommodation are being developed on an ongoing basis. A special initiative on care, including care of the elderly, under Sustaining Progress is a priority at present.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">A clear strategy is in place to meet the challenges ahead as our population ages. The aim is to ensure that retired people have an adequate income and related services which, as far as possible, maintains their pre-retirement standard of living and that these pensions and services are sustainable in the long run. As our population ages the current gap with other EU countries on overall expenditure on the aged will progressively close and, above all, I am confident that because of the Government's prudent approach, the increased expenditure will be sustainable.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1074">The renewal of payable order books for disability allowance recipients was intended to  cover the 26 week period with effect from 1 October 2003. Due to a printing error, the order for 31 December 2003 was omitted. On 15 October the Department wrote to all recipients of disability allowance whose payable order books were affected. This letter outlines the nature of the error and what revised arrangements will apply. A problem of this nature has not previously arisen and steps are being taken to ensure that there will not be a recurrence. Arrangements have been made to issue a single voucher to all affected beneficiaries in good time for payment on 31 December 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">My overall focus for the Irish Presidency will be to advance the EU social policy agenda generally and, in particular, make progress in delivering on the Lisbon agenda. One of the goals of the Lisbon agenda is to achieve greater social cohesion. In this regard, the second round reports on national action plans for social inclusion were evaluated recently. The results are currently being compiled into the second joint inclusion report for approval by the Council of Ministers and for presentation to the European Council at its spring meeting during the Irish Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Ireland will also host a conference of people experiencing poverty, the aim of which will be to further develop ways of promoting participation by and consultation with people experiencing poverty in the context of developing policies in this area. Making work pay, that is, addressing the financial incentives to encourage people to seek, take up and remain in work is one of the key policy areas which we will address as part of our contribution to modernising social protection systems. This issue has been chosen as the main theme for discussion at the Informal Council of Ministers for Employment and Social Policy in January next. The issue of migration will also be a priority for my Department during the Irish Presidency.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_98">We will host a conference in April, the theme of which will be "Reconciling Mobility and Social Inclusion" and its main focus will be on the role of social and economic policies in achieving social inclusion for migrants. A major priority in this context for the Irish Presidency will be to work for adoption by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament of the proposals to simplify and modernise the EU regulations on social security of migrant workers. This will provide migrant workers moving within the EU with a  more streamlined set of rules aimed at protecting their social security and health care rights. Following the accession of the ten new member states in May next, it is our intention to host a special conference, in co-operation with the Hungarian Government, on the practical application of the new regulations for all member states.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">Family policy is another priority for the Irish Presidency. In the area of family policy and to mark the tenth anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family, the Irish Presidency will host a major international conference, the title of which will be "Families, Change and Social Policy in Europe". I am happy that these events represent a substantial programme of work and a significant contribution to moving forward the social policy agenda of the Community.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1081">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide fully for their own heating needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">A fuel allowance payment of €9 per week is paid to eligible households, while an additional €3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to €12.90 per week. These payments are made for the duration of the fuel season which lasts for 29 weeks. The fuel allowances represent a contribution towards a person's normal heating and lighting expenses. In addition, many households also qualify for electricity and gas allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083">There is also a facility available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. The fuel allowance scheme has been improved in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks. The significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have also improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. Primary payment rates are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year and increases in these rates benefit a wider range of recipients.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_100">With regard to lone parents and fuel poverty, fuel allowances are payable to lone parents on the same basis as applies to other categories of recipient. However, a lone parent may have earnings up to €146.50 per week disregarded in full for the purposes of the one parent family scheme while earnings between €146.50 and €293.00 per week are assessed at half-rate. So long as a lone parent is in receipt of one parent family payment even at a reduced rate he or she can qualify for the full fuel allowance subject to household composition rules. The questions of increases in the rates of fuel allowance as well as changes in the duration of the heating season would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1085">Overpayments can arise in the social welfare system for different reasons, including deliberate fraud, failure by claimants to notify the Department of changes in their circumstances or error on the part of the claimant or the Department. Some 38,628 recipients of social welfare payments were assessed with overpayments totalling almost €29 million in 2002. This represents about 0.3% of total scheme expenditure in 2002. Cases of apparent fraud accounted for 41% of the value of overpayments or a total of almost €12 million. Customer or third party error, where the customer failed to inform the Department of a change in circumstances, accounted for 34% or almost €10 million. A further 20% was accounted for by overpayments which came to light after the death of a claimant where previously non-declared assets arose on the distribution of their estate. Overpayments attributed to departmental error constituted 7% of all cases and accounted for 5% of the total value of all overpayments in 2002 or €1.5 million.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_101">In relation to ensuring that overpayments do not occur, my Department has detailed procedures and checks in place to ensure that payments are properly made and claims are properly authorised, while also endeavouring to ensure good service to claimants. The ongoing use of information technology in the provision of the Department's services as well as staff training and development are key elements of the Departments programme in that regard. The Department has in place a control programme, the aim of which includes the prevention of overpayments and their detection when they do occur. This involves checks at the point of claiming, reviews of means, verification that the conditions of entitlement continue to be met on an ongoing basis, medical reviews, inspections of employers, arrangements for debt recovery and prosecutions. The Department also has an internal audit unit,  which advises on risk management and internal control procedures, and of course the Department is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Procedures and checks are subject to regular review to ensure that they are adequate and to ensure that overpayments are minimised.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1088">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 123 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">The scope and operation of social welfare systems of EU member states vary greatly and for this reason care needs to be taken in interpreting comparative data on social welfare budgets. EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the EU, publishes comparisons of social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP across the EU. This encompasses not only social welfare expenditure but also expenditure in other areas such as health care, social housing, employment support programmes – for example, certain FÁS programmes, and other social exclusion programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">The latest EUROSTAT figures on social protection expenditure were released in February 2003 and deal with developments up to and including 2000. It does not take into account the developments in social protection expenditure over the last two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">It is also the case that gross expenditure measures can distort the real picture, as they do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits, nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions or allowances, as opposed to direct cash payments. Other factors which have a bearing on the amount of expenditure are the extent to which the State provides supplementary pensions, child care and elderly care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">In addition, social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is significantly influenced by the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment. For example, in the three year period 1990 to 1993 EU social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose on average by over 3% from 25.5% to 28.8%, as a result of the slower rate of economic growth and rising unemployment during that period.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_102">Conversely, over the five year period 1994 to 1998, the percentage declined slightly to 27.7% due to renewed economic growth and a decline in unemployment during that period. For Ireland in 1990, expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP was 18.4%. This rose to 20.2% in 1993, and then declined to 14.7% in 2000. These changes mirrored the developments just described in other EU countries, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_103">Annual rates of growth ranged from 8% to 11% in the period 1994 to 2000, compared to an average of 2.5% in the EU, while levels of unemployment declined from 14.3% to less than 4% over the same period. Under this Government there have been sustained and substantial increases in social protection expenditure. The EUROSTAT report on social protection states that the increase in real-terms expenditure on social protection in Ireland over the period 1993 to 1999 was "well above the average."  EUROSTAT figures show a 21.4% increase in theper capita expenditure on social protection in the period 1995 to 2000, compared with an EU average of 8.7%, and over the longer period of 1990 to 1999, an increase of 50% in real terms, compared with an EU average of 24%.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">There is scope for further improvements in Ireland's social protection infrastructure and this Government will continue to address this guided by the national anti-poverty strategy, while at the same time taking measures to maintain economic growth and competitiveness.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_105">At present just over 11% of our population is over age 65, against an EU average of 16%. The proportion of older people in our population will remain much the same for the next ten years after which it is projected to increase rapidly to 15% in 2021, 19% in 2031 and 28% in 2056. Ireland faces the same challenges as most other developed countries; the only difference is that these emerge later in our case and we have more time to prepare and to learn from the experiences of others. In the years ahead, we face two main  challenges: to ensure that retired people have an adequate income, which as far as possible maintains their pre-retirement standard of living; and to ensure that these pensions are sustainable in the long run.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_106">The Government has a clear strategy in place to meet these challenges which includes the National Pensions Reserve Fund, now standing at €8.4 billion, and significant increases in basic social welfare pensions with a target rate of €200 per week to be achieved by 2007.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">The Government also aims to increase private pensions coverage amongst the workforce from a current level of 50% of the workforce to 70%. Personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs, are the main instrument being deployed in pursuit of this objective and these have been available for the last six months. A joint EU Commission and Council report on national pensions strategies published earlier this year considered that Ireland has made good progress in ensuring the financial sustainability of the pension system while at the same time making provisions for increasing the adequacy of pensions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">The Government has no plans to increase the retirement age, as suggested by the Society of Actuaries. However, that is not to say that the important role increased workforce participation can play in ensuring sustainability is not recognised. The root of the challenge facing pension systems is a reduction in the active workforce and an increase in the number of pensioners. It is important that we encourage and facilitate those who wish to extend their working lives after normal pension age.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_109">In this regard, we need to strike a balance between economic, social and individual requirements in that, ideally, a person who wished to continue working should not be obliged to retire. The relationship between tax, pension and benefits also needs to be monitored closely to see if it can provide a greater incentive to extend working life.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Naughten</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      if she will reconsider the qualifying criteria for unemployment benefit to allow people, recently unemployed, to qualify for some payment while attempting to set up a business or self employment.
      [24317/03]

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1097">Unemployment benefit provides for periods of involuntary unemployment and is not payable in respect of any day during which a person is engaged in insurable employment or self-employment. To qualify for payment, a person  must be available for and genuinely seeking full-time work in respect of each declared day of unemployment. This means being prepared to accept any offers of suitable full-time employment immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">In considering entitlement under this condition, account is taken of the person's skills, qualifications and experience, duration of unemployment and the availability of job vacancies in the locality. As there is an onus on the individual to show that this condition is satisfied on an ongoing basis, he or she will not qualify for payment of unemployment benefit while setting up a business or engaging in self-employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">However, in certain circumstances, a self-employed person may be entitled to claim unemployment benefit for part of a week. For example, if engaged under a contract for service, that is, self-employed, for up to three days per week, unemployment benefit may be payable for the remainder of the week provided that all qualifying conditions are satisfied. Where a person is not eligible for unemployment benefit, arrangements are already in place where a self-employed person, whose overall income falls below the rate of payment appropriate to his or her family size, can qualify for an unemployment assistance payment, which is means-tested.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">In assessing means, account is taken of net income which the person may reasonably expect to receive in the next year, after all expenses necessarily incurred in carrying out the business are deducted. In this context, there are currently 1,670 self-employed people receiving an average payment of €130.83 unemployment assistance per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">The national employment action plan is the Department's principal intervention measure to support and encourage unemployed people to progress towards employment. It is particularly focused on early intervention, with those receiving unemployment payments for six months being referred to FÁS for assessment of the progression path most suited to their needs. This early intervention helps prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1102">Also, the back to work enterprise allowance scheme is available to the most disadvantaged social welfare recipients, including those unemployed for five years or more who wish to take up self-employment for at least 20 hours per week. I have no proposals to make changes to the unemployment benefit scheme at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1112">In May 2000, a special half rate old age contributory pension was introduced to enable people with pre-1953 insurance, who could not qualify for a payment under normal qualifying conditions, to receive a pension. People already qualifying for pensions at less than half rate could also benefit from the new scheme. In order to be eligible for the payment a person needs 260 paid contributions at the appropriate rate, which can comprise a mixture of pre and post 1953 contributions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_112">Based on analysis and previous experience, it was estimated that some 3,000 persons would qualify for this new pension in 2000 at a full year cost of €8.9 million. The overall claim load was not expected to exceed 5,000 people. By the end of 2000, however, over 11,500 applications had been received of which 3,545 had been awarded pensions. The Department also reviewed 13,500pro rata pension cases receiving less than half rate and 7,332 of these were successful in qualifying for the new pension. This high level of interest has continued with claims still being received at the rate of 60 per week. Up to the end of August 2003, a total of 27,562 pre-1953 pensions were awarded. Almost 63% of these pensions are being paid to residents of the UK and other coun tries. The cost in 2002, which includes the budget increases in those payments, amounted to €113 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_113">Prior to the introduction of this pre-1953 pension in May 2000, there was considerable debate about this and significant claims from pensioners, many quite elderly, for some recognition of their pre-1953 contributions. I understand there were representations from all sides of the House on this issue. The pension introduced gives limited recognition to these contributions, which did not specifically contain a pension element, and is only of benefit to current pensioners.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_114">The reason for the underestimate was, essentially, that the Department, based on its current databases, did not anticipate the large influx of claims from persons resident abroad. This was greatly influenced by a major campaign by groups working in Irish centres of population in the UK and by the Department's own publicity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_115">The numbers qualifying and the overall cost of this measure have been very seriously underestimated. That said, my Department is frequently required to estimate the costs of policy measures and its record in this regard is a good one. This has been recognised by the Department of Finance. The experience in this case was highly unusual and, as I have explained, related to lack of data. However, the Department will take on board the specific lessons of this project in estimating the costs of similar proposals in the future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1117">I assume the Deputy's question  relates to the work of social welfare appeals officers. The chief appeals officer from time to time convenes meetings of appeals officers for the purpose of discussing matters relating to the discharge of their functions, including, in particular, consistency in the application of the statutory provisions. In addition, frequent informal meetings are held to discuss issues arising from appeals and appreciation of the requirements and implications of changing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">There are currently 19 appeals officers serving in the appeals office. When allowance is made for work-sharing, this represents a full-time equivalent of 17.5 officers. Normally, all appeals officers are assigned to oral hearings once their training period is completed. The full-time officers work normal Civil Service hours over a five day week while the work sharers vary between 50% and 80% of the full-time norm. Their work involves the vetting of cases to determine which can be decided summarily and which should be referred for oral hearings, presiding at oral hearings, the completion of reports on appeals recently determined and preparation for hearings scheduled to take place on their next circuit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">An appeals officer normally spends one week out of every three hearing appeals on one of the eight circuits encompassing some 70 locations outside of the Dublin area. When an officer returns from a week on circuit, the cases for his next week out will normally have been selected. In any given week there are approximately six appeals officers assigned to circuit work. While not on circuit appeals officers are either holding hearings in Dublin or carrying out the other duties referred to previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">The selection of the circuits to be visited in any given week is based on the numbers of appeals on hand. In general, those who are waiting longest can expect to be scheduled for hearing when next an appeals officer is in the area. A small number of cases are given special priority where exceptional circumstances arise. However, some cases of long standing may not be in a position to proceed because, for example, the proposed date does not suit the appellant or his or her representative. It would seldom be possible for an appeals officer to dispose of all appeals listed for hearing in the course of a visit to a region.</p>

          <p eId="para_1122">The 2003 social welfare budget package included provision for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 5.1% to 7.6% as well as similar percentage  increases in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowances. In particular, increases ranging from 5.7% to 7.6% were provided for recipients of old age and widow-widower's pensions. It is now projected by the Department of Finance that prices will increase by an average of 3.6% in 2003 as a whole. I particularly welcome the recent decline in the annual rate to 2.9% in September of this year. Consequently, the social welfare increases allocated in budget 2003 have been well ahead of the projected inflation rate. Social welfare spending rose by over €3.5 billion between 1997 and 2002. An additional €833 million in social welfare spending is provided for during this year and this will bring the projected level of annual spending to over €10 billion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1124">Families and family life are undergoing profound changes in Ireland. The main reasons include the increasing participation of women in employment, difficulties in reconciling work and family life, growing incidence of marital breakdown and lone parenthood generally, ageing of the population and the likely growth in the numbers of dependent elderly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">The Family Support Agency was formally established in May of this year to draw together the main family-related programmes and services developed by the Government since 1997. Its functions include the provision of services in relation to family mediation, marriage and relationship counselling and family support services, dissemination of information on family related services and programmes, including parenting, and support for the promotion and development of family and community services. The agency is currently finalising its strategic plan on implementing its functions for submission next month in accordance with the requirements of the Family Support Agency Act 2001.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_123">It is against this background that I began in May this year, five years after publication of the report of the Commission on the Family, a nationwide consultation on the future development of family policy. The fora are designed to provide me and my officials with an opportunity to hear the views of a cross section of family members from different regions of the country and those who work with them, including public representatives. Their views are being sought on the main challenges that confront families today, the effectiveness of Government policies and programmes in supporting families to meet these challenges, and on what the priorities should be for strengthening families. Part of the process includes workshops on parenting, balancing work and family life, the family as carer and relation ships in difficulty. These workshops allow a more focused examination of the issues and the identification of the supports families need to carry out their important role.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_124">To date three fora have been held in Donegal on 1 May, Kilkenny on 25 September and Cork on 9 October, with two further fora planned for Galway on 6 November and Dublin on 4 December. Reports on each forum meeting are being drawn up. A final thematic report that will draw together all the issues raised is being prepared. Already a clear picture is emerging of the concerns people have on family-related issues, the type of policy developments desired and the priorities for action. The thematic report is scheduled for publication in early 2004 at the start of the tenth anniversary of the UN International Year of the Family.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_125">The Irish Presidency, with the support of the EU Commission, is also planning to hold an international conference in Dublin on 13-14 May 2004 to mark this year entitled, Families, Change and European Social Policy. This conference will address in an international context many of the issues being discussed at the fora. Drawing on the views and analysis emerging from this consultation process, it is my intention to have a clear, coherent and comprehensive statement of family policy prepared by end 2004. This will be designed to address the profound changes for families and family life taking place and to identify priorities for strengthening families in the key contribution they make to the well-being of their individual members and society as a whole.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1127">As reported recently in the 2002 Annual Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, one of my Department's telephone systems was accessed illegally at a cost of €294,136.43, including VAT, over a five week period in July and early August 2002. The intrusion used a facility of the telephone system that enables remote access. This type of access is used typically for maintenance purposes. The facility could, however, be used to allow remote callers make international calls through the Department's telephone system. Departmental staff were unaware that the facility existed on the telephone system or that it was enabled. As telephone billing is received in arrears, it was not possible to immediately identify the unusually high usage and it was only through prompt notification from the telephone supplier that the breach was identified and corrective action immediately taken. When the notification was  received, the facility which had allowed the intrusion was detected and disabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The other 19 similar telephone systems were checked and the feature was found enabled on three others which were immediately disabled. All of these systems have been in place for a considerable period of time. It was also determined that the Department's more numerous smaller telephone systems had a related, although lesser, risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">Contracts were placed in November 2002 to upgrade all 220 telephone systems to the latest versions of software and, where necessary, hardware. This work began in January 2003. The majority of these systems have now been upgraded and ten remain to be done. A full review of all perimeter security on the Department's voice and data network is being carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">My Department is a major user of information and communications technology, ICT, for the provision of customer services and internal administration. The majority of the schemes administered by my Department are computerised and most staff at all levels conduct their day to day communications using computer facilities. To support its 4,500 staff in carrying out those critical business requirements, my Department has an extensive telephone and data computer network linking all 220 Department offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">My Department reacted swiftly to the intrusion and has since embarked on a major hardware, software upgrade and installation programme to ensure continued adherence to the highest available security standards. External resources are also being deployed to guarantee a consistently high level of security on the network.</p>

          <p eId="para_1133">Relative income poverty is defined by reference to an income threshold set at a particular percentage of average – mean or median – income, adjusted for family size and composition using equivalence scales. In Ireland, data on the levels of relative income poverty have been derived from analysis of the results of the Living in Ireland Survey undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134">A wide range of factors influence the levels of income poverty at any given point in time. They include: earnings levels; patterns of household formation; the direction of tax and welfare policies; employment and unemployment levels; employment structures; and the level of recourse to welfare supports generally. These interact in a highly dynamic environment and the relative impacts will inevitably change at different points of the economic cycle.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_126">Relative poverty has increased in Ireland in  recent years, mainly because a majority have enjoyed substantial increases in their incomes resulting in a widening gap with the incomes of the less well off. The reasons for this include increased employment, an increase in the proportion of two income households, an increasing proportion of better quality, better paid jobs available to a more educated workforce, fewer dependants resulting from the decline in the birth rate and a tax system designed to provide incentives for economic development and remove obstacles to employment participation, which leaves people with more take home pay. This approach has helped to generate the high levels of economic growth that Ireland has enjoyed over the past decade and to sustain the economy during the current economic difficulties. This growth has generated the resources required to significantly improve our social protection system and social services generally and to work on closing the gap with other EU countries on physical infrastructure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_127">The substantial improvements made in social provision, however, have not kept pace with the increases in income of those in employment, especially with those in higher paid employment. Our flat rate social welfare system is very effective in making basic provision, especially for the less well off but not specifically at addressing rela tive poverty levels, especially during times of high economic growth. It is, however, a more secure and sustainable system especially during economic downturns and in the face of an ageing population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">The Government is committed to steadily improving the system by increasing payment related benefits in real terms under the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy and the recent national action plan. My Department has also commissioned research from the Economic and Social Research Institute which will seek to define more closely the factors which impact on the levels of relative income poverty in Ireland, with a view to determining whether it could be addressed more effectively. It is envisaged that this research will be completed before the end of this year.</summary>

Redirecting the established force of development and investment preferences is not a straightforward issue, nor one that can be achieved simply by Government edict and completed in a matter of months. The NSS is a 20 year strategy designed to enable every place in the country to achieve its potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">A catalyst to regional development is putting in place important enterprise supporting infrastructure as a strong counterbalancing force to make regional locations viable and attractive options when businesses make investment decisions. My Department is overseeing this regional emphasis through the enterprise support agencies, which have prioritised regional development as part of their strategic development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">For example, IDA Ireland has developed a broader vision for helping both foreign firms located here and new potential investors. Its key objective is to encourage firms to be more innovative rather than production-led, as well as focusing on regional economic development that is broader than industrial development and takes account of quality of life factors. The objective of the strategy is to create a strongly sustainable magnet in each of the regions for enterprise development.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_135">IDA has established strong connections with regional educational institutions in areas of skills, specialised training and research and develop ment and in support of its regional strategy the agency now has nine offices outside Dublin – six of which are in the Objective One region. Furthermore, key business units such as the regions and property division, ICT and health care divisions and engineering and consumer products have been decentralised to Athlone, Waterford and Sligo. On the employment front, for example, IDA Ireland has been successful in delivering 44% of new greenfield jobs in the BMW region. This is a creditable achievement in the face of the global contraction in the international mobile investment market.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_136">Implementing NSS supporting strategies is also clearly present in the regional activities of Enterprise Ireland's strategy for balanced regional development that is built on four pillars: developing and sustaining existing businesses in each region; enhancing the environment for business in each region; identifying and encouraging new start up companies with strong growth potential; and identifying new opportunities for economic development in the regions, including investments by expansion-minded Dublin based companies</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">These pillars have formed the blueprint for Enterprise Ireland's activities over the past three years. In 2002 56% of total approvals were to regionally based clients. So far this year, 65% of approvals are for regional clients. In 2002, 35% of new high potential start up – HPSU – companies were located in the regions. This year, 51% of HPSUs are located outside Dublin. Enterprise Ireland is implementing well thought out activities in each of the regions to ensure that technology and innovation supports are in place to develop the capability of companies regionally.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">Enterprise Ireland targets existing companies and high potential start ups, to accelerate their growth by linking with regional research centres. Regional third level colleges are in turn supported in business-related programmes around basic and strategic research, promoting campus companies and in collaborating with industry. Enterprise Ireland has committed over €27 million to provide incubation space in 12 colleges throughout the country. This support strengthens all important links between business development and third level education. The following centres have been assisted. Athlone IT, Carlow IT, Cork IT, Dún Laoghaire, Dundalk IT, GMIT, Galway and Castlebar, Tralee IT, Waterford IT, St. Angela's College, Sligo, National College of Ireland, Dublin, DCU, UCD and NUI Galway.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_139">Under the webworks programme, regional development hubs will be set up to generate initial mass in the regions for firms that will be strong research and development and export performers. Webworks are state of the art buildings for high tech, office based indigenous projects. Enterprise Ireland is developing centres in four locations – Sligo, Galway, Cork and Waterford – and a fifth will be located in Limerick. Work is expected to commence on all five locations in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_140">At the micro enterprise level, the funding of community based enterprise centres is a crucial part of the drive to create new regional enterprise. Over the past two years, Enterprise Ireland has committed €8 million to assist local communities to develop their own enterprise space. Some 35 projects have been helped in this way and they are located as follows: north-west, five; west, five; mid-west, six; south-west, three; south-east, four; mid-east, three; north-east, four; Dublin, two; and the midlands, three.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">While earlier expectations of regional employment expansion may be hampered in the short-term because of the poorer economic climate worldwide, essential enterprise infrastructure improvements are making a difference and contributing to making regional business centres more attractive for the technologies and entrepreneurs of the future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1239">The person named applied for premium for 13 cows and seven heifers under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme. The terms and conditions of the scheme require that where an applicant has applied on 14 animals or more he must continue to own, possess, hold and maintain on his holding during the retention period a number of suckler cows at least equal to 60% and at most equal to 85% and a number of heifers at least equal to 15% and at most equal to 40% of the total number of animals for which premium was requested. On examination of the application submitted by the person named it was found that four heifers calved during the six months retention period leaving 17 cows and three heifers. The three heifers constituted the minimum 15% heifer requirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">On 11 August 2003 he sold heifer tag number 181691420134 and replaced it with cow tag number GAB811852.

          <p eId="para_1242">Reduction penalties on claimed animals are calculated in accordance with paragraphs 39 and 40 of the terms and conditions of the scheme.

          <p eId="para_1248">The advisory group on the role of women in agriculture, which had its origins in the White Paper on Rural Development, published its report in September 2000. The advisory group's report contained 36 recommendations in total, covering a broad range of policy and operational areas, relating to 19 Departments and agencies. These areas were: statistical evaluation of women farmers; employment and training; information technology; social inclusion; representation, and personal finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">Action was taken, in as far as practicable, on the individual recommendations in the advisory group's report.

The establishment of a women in agriculture division in my Department was not among the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">The establishment of a National Rural Development Forum, which meets in open session twice a year, provides a forum for continued attention to many of the issues raised in the advisory group's report. It should also be noted that, subsequent to the publication of the report, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established. In addition, elements of the report were incorporated into the National Plan for Women published in 2002 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department is currently preparing a report on progress across all recommendations in the advisory group's report on the role of women in agriculture.</p>

The office is open to the public between 9.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday. Approximately 90% of customers are PAYE taxpayers mainly seeking adjustments to their current year tax credits and emergency tax. The office also assists these customers in making claims for repayments of tax following a period of unemployment and in respect of earlier years. The claims are then referred to the customer's tax district for processing. Where a statement of liability – P21 – is required, the necessary information is sought from the customer and the request is referred to the customer's tax district for processing. Many customers require housing forms to be signed for the Department of the  Environment, Heritage and Local Government and South Dublin County Council in respect of housing grant schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1266">The office also deals with self-employed customers and provides general information regarding their obligations under self-assessment and pay and file. Assistance is provided in completing registration forms and tax returns and payments in respect of tax due are accepted at the office. The distribution of C2 certificates to the construction industry in Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow is also managed from this office. The office does not deal with telephone inquiries. These are dealt with on the Revenue lo-call service at 1890 60 50 90 or in the appropriate business area. The Revenue Commissioners also have an office at St. John's House, Tallaght, Dublin 24, which deals with vehicle registration tax.</p>

          <p eId="para_1272">The Government decided to reduce authorised num bers in the public service by 5,000 by the end of 2005 and on the distribution of 4,300 of these posts between sectors. I intend to revisit the issue early in 2004 to see where the balance of 700 posts can be identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">Authorised numbers will have been reduced by a total of 1,073 posts by the end of 2003. This will be followed by a further reduction of 1,479 posts in 2004 giving a total reduction of 2,552 by the end of 2004. This total does not include any of the balance of 700 posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">The 2,552 total will be made up of 400 posts in the health sector, 550 in the education sector, another 550 in the Civil Service, 220 in the Defence Forces, 667 in the local authorities and 165 in non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">I have already stated that I intend that the reduction should be distributed appropriately across all grades and levels. The reduction will be achieved through natural wastage and it is up to each individual public sector manager to work within the parameters outlined to them. There will not be a reduction in front line persons such as gardaí, nurses and doctors.</p>

          <p eId="para_1299">As the Deputy will be aware, I set out the Government's approach to and priorities for the Intergovernmental Conference in my speech in the House on 15 October. Broadly, we have identified tax, aspects of criminal justice and defence as priority issues. We have also indicated that where appropriate, we will support improvements to the proposals on the institutions. There is also a range of other matters on which improvements can be made without radically changing the draft. We will take the opportunities which arise to support such improvements without losing sight of the overall balance and coherence of the text.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">Discussion and debate of the draft constitutional treaty should be as wide and inclusive as possible. The submission to which the Deputy refers is, therefore, a welcome contribution. It covers a wide range of issues. The Intergovernmental Conference is considering the text prepared by the Convention. However, it is not yet possible to say whether all of the issues to which the submission refers will arise for substantive discussion. The Government has welcomed the important work carried out at the Convention towards ensuring a positive outcome on the incorporation of the charter into the new constitutional treaty. If the charter is to be given legal effect, it is vital that all of the relevant parties – citizens, the Union's institutions and the member states – can have clarity and certainty as to its scope and application. For that reason, the Government strongly supported the amendments the Convention recommended to the charter's provisions governing its interpretation and application. These recommendations should be accepted by the Intergovernmental Conference. The Government has also welcomed the increased role national parliaments and the European Parliament will play under the new constitutional treaty, which should enhance their respective abilities to hold governments and Union institutions to account.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_142">The submission raises a number of specific questions in relation to the text of Chapter IV of Part III of the draft constitutional treaty, which covers the area of freedom, security and justice. Many of these deal with detailed policy matters which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. However, the Government supports efforts to increase the Union's effectiveness in the area of justice and home affairs. The approach proposed for asylum and immigration matters is acceptable. However, given the need to respect and protect the different traditions of member states in the area of criminal law, the Government believes that unanimity remains the most appropriate  decision-making procedure in some of the most sensitive articles in this area. We have also indicated that we do not see a need for an article on the possible creation of a European public prosecutor to be included in the text.</summary>

It aims to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Ugandan Parliament through the development of appropriate representative and administrative capabilities. In particular, it seeks to contribute to the professional development of MPs through such means as working visits to European and regional parliaments, which are intended to expose MPs to different aspects of democratic and parliamentary practice. This assistance is in line with Development Co-operation Ireland's support for the development of good governance, which is a key component of our Uganda programme, underpinning as it does the entire development process.

This policy aims to encourage a peaceful transition to democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable increase in the living standards of the Cuban people.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_143">In April 2003, Ireland and our EU partners condemned the summary trial and lengthy prison sentences imposed on 75 dissidents for exercising their right to freedom of speech, as well as the  summary trial and rapid execution of three ferry-boat hijackers, which were in breach of international minimum standards for the implementation of the death penalty.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">Mindful of reports about the poor detention conditions of prisoners with serious health problems, the EU on 5 June called once again on the Cuban authorities to release immediately all political prisoners and appealed to the Cuban authorities to ensure that prisoners were not exposed to inhumane treatment. The EU also took a number of diplomatic steps, in line with the policy set out in the common position. The measures adopted on 5 June 2003 were to limit bilateral high-level governmental visits, to reduce participation in cultural events, to invite Cuban dissidents to national day events at EU embassies in Havana and to proceed to an early re-evaluation of the EU Common Position, which had not been due to take place until December 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">On 21 July 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, confirmed the objectives of the Common Position. The Council noted that since the previous evaluation of December 2002 not only had there been no positive steps by the Cuban Government in terms of improved respect for human rights, but the human rights situation had actually deteriorated. The Council also noted that since the beginning of 2003 the Cuban authorities had clamped down on private small businesses, further curtailed access to the Internet, impounded satellite televisions and confiscated foreign newspapers and radios. Nevertheless, the Council reaffirmed the validity of the Common Position's constructive engagement with Cuba as the basis of EU policy towards that country, to be pursued through continuing political dialogue with a view to producing tangible results in the political, economic and civil rights spheres, as well as by means of development co-operation in order to,inter alia, improve the living standards of the Cuban people.</summary>

While some progress has been made in alleviating the suffering caused by 20 years of civil war and, by default, the type of human rights abuses so often found in times of conflict, the overall human rights situation in Sudan remains grim. Through our membership of the EU and of the intergovernmental authority on development, IGAD, international partners' forum, Ireland will continue to press the Government of Sudan for progress in such areas as democracy, freedom of the media and religious freedom.

While the encouraging progress made in the peace talks has rightly been the focus of international support, the EU has not forgotten that the issue of human rights in Sudan needs to be urgently addressed. Therefore, the EU continues to accord high priority to democracy, good governance and the rule of law in its ongoing dialogue with the Government of Sudan. In addition to that political dialogue, in March 2003 the EU opened a dialogue with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement to encourage thede facto leadership in southern Sudan to play a progressive role in human rights in that region. During its Presidency of the EU in 2004, Ireland will play its part in efforts to achieve a consensus resolution of the Sudanese problem.</summary>

Ireland, along with its EU partners, avails of every opportunity to encourage the Tunisian Government to take further measures to strengthen democracy and respect for human rights. We will continue to impress upon this Government the importance of implementing all necessary reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">The Government believes that the human rights dialogue between the EU and Tunisia is enhanced by the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement under the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. In particular, Article 2 of the agreement states that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, guides the internal and international policies of the parties and will constitute an essential element of the agreement. The agreement also commits Tunisia to developing the rule of law and democracy, including the upholding of fundamental freedoms. At the most recent meeting of the EU-Tunisia association council on 29 September, the EU availed of the opportunity to make its concerns known to the Tunisian Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_1318">The Government is deeply concerned about human rights in Zimbabwe. It has been clear to Ireland and the EU for some time that the Government of Zimbabwe is not a willing partner in dialogue  on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, so much so that a political dialogue initiated by the EU to address these issues was closed in February 2002 following the failure of the Government of Zimbabwe to protect human rights in that country and to engage on the subject at any meaningful level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">On 18 February 2003, the EU adopted a Common Position on Zimbabwe which noted the degradation of the political situation in Zimbabwe and renewed sanctions imposed on those the EU deems most responsible for the violation of human rights. Also in February, the EU issued a declaration expressing its concern at detailed incidences of arbitrary arrests and inhumane treatment of opposition members and civil society organisers and calling on the Government of Zimbabwe to engage in meaningful dialogue with the opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">The EU has identified a number of benchmarks for the Government of Zimbabwe to meet, which could lead to a normalisation of relations with the EU. Among the short-term benchmarks identified were an end to political intimidation and violence, the restoration of democratic values and respect for human rights. Medium-term measures to be undertaken by the Government of Zimbabwe include introducing a number of proposals to Parliament to redress current restrictions on freedom of expression and association.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The situation in Zimbabwe is grave and it is a particularly dangerous time for individuals who actively oppose the Government. I condemn utterly the abuses being carried out by state forces and other groups affiliated to the governing party and the lack of accountability on the part of the Government of Zimbabwe in these matters.</p>

While a ceasefire has been in place for some time between the parties, the conflict in Western Sahara has given rise to serious humanitarian issues which remain unresolved, including the plight of the Saharaoui refugees in Algeria. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross are actively involved with the Polisario and the Government of Algeria to alleviate the situation in the camps, which are mainly located in the Tindouf region of Algeria.

          <p eId="para_1325">I have set out the Government's position on Papua, including its human rights record, a number of times this year. At the April meeting of the EU external relations Council Ireland, together with our EU partners, adopted revised Council conclusions on Indonesia. We support the development of a strengthened dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia as the best means by which to address our concerns. I met with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, at the EU-ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting at Brussels in January 2003 and raised issues of particular concern, including the situation in Papua. Deputy Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, also met with Mr. Wirajuda at the ASEM Foreign Ministers' meeting hosted by Mr. Wirajuda in July 2003 and reiterated these concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1326">Officials of my Department raised these concerns when they met with their Indonesian counterparts at the ASEM senior officials' meeting, held in Jakarta on 12 and 13 May 2003, and again at the senior officials' meeting on 21 and 22 July 2003, which preceded the ASEM Foreign Ministers' meeting. Officials of my Department also meet regularly with representatives of the West Papua action group. On 12 September 2003 they met with Mr. Aloysius Renwarin, director of the Papua-based Institute for Human Rights Study and Advocacy, ELSHAM, and were briefed on the situation in Papua.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">The Government continues to monitor the situation closely and will continue to encourage the authorities in Indonesia to act with full regard to the interests of the people of Papua. In this regard, I welcome the decision of the Indonesian Government in August to suspend the implementation of the presidential decree dividing Papua into three provinces. Ireland, together with our EU partners, will continue to support the development of a strengthened partnership and effective dialogue between the EU and Indonesia. The Government sees this as the most effective framework at this time for addressing our serious concerns about the situation in Papua.</p>

We pursue these concerns together with our partners in the European Union through appropriate channels in the United Nations and in our bilateral relations. EU heads of mission have undertaken a number of <i>démarches </i>in Islamabad to convey these concerns to the Pakistani Government on behalf of the EU. During a recent <i>démarche</i> on 23 June 2003 the local troika raised concerns regarding the application of the death penalty, the protection offered to religious minorities and discrimination against women.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">The EU Presidency plays an important role in fostering a constructive relationship with Pakistan in which positive developments with regard to human rights can be encouraged. As a member of the troika, Ireland participated in an EU ministerial mission to Islamabad this week.

The discussion of democratisation and human rights in Pakistan was a core element of the mission.</p>

          <p eId="para_1353">My Department's policy to combat educational disadvantage and early school leaving are designed to include related and complementary strategies to improve participation rates and outcomes in mainstream schools and to provide  second-chance education and training for those who left school early without any qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">The findings from an evaluation carried out on education maintenance allowance in East Ayrshire, Scotland, shows that while there is an increase in participation and improved retention is most evident in young people from low-income families, it is unlikely to retain those who are unhappy in school and who have little experience of academic success. The causes of early school leaving cannot be attributed to one single factor. They are multifaceted and complex, such as family history of early school leaving, intellectual or physical challenge, disruptive behaviour, severe literacy problems or learning difficulties, economic stress or distress in one's family background, membership of an ethnic minority group or membership of the Traveller community. The problem of early school leaving requires movement on a number of fronts, including legislative and curricular reforms and preventative interventions. This is the approach my Department is taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board is an important plank in the campaign to keep students at school and will provide a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. With regard to the curriculum, my Department's strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students, which aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision and meet the needs of the diversity of pupils in our second level schools by expanding funding for programmes such as the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme, the vocational preparation training and the leaving certificate applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">The school completion programme has been implemented to target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. In line with current thinking, it favours an integrated cross-community and cross-sectoral approach based on the development of local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. The school completion programme recognises that a wide variety of home, community and school-based factors can contribute to low school attainment and early school leaving. Consequently, strategies designed to address the needs of young people at risk of early school leaving must include a range of actions that impinge on these aspects of young people's lives and must be holistic and child-centred by nature. It entails targeting individual young people aged four to 18, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes.</p>

It is designed to offer a programme of integrated general education, vocational training and work experience. A training allowance is payable to participants at different rates, depending on age. A similar programme in a culturally supportive environment is operated for Travellers in a network of senior Traveller training centres. My Department operates the following means-tested grant schemes for further and higher education: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third-level maintenance grant scheme for trainees; and the grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. The higher education grants scheme is administered by local authorities, while the other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_151">The employment of teaching personnel is a matter for individual boards of management. My  Department does not have information on the number of schools that have vacancies for permanent teachers. Temporary teachers are employed by boards of management to replace teachers who are absent on career breaks, job-sharing, parental leave, carer's leave or unpaid maternity leave. In addition some ex-quota posts are sanctioned by the special education section of my Department on a temporary basis. There are currently 56 temporary teachers employed in primary schools in County Donegal.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_152">The primary sector, including schools in Donegal, has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and to provide for those with special educational needs. The difficulties being experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career break and job-sharing schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_153">My Department has introduced a range of measures to address the current shortage of qualified teachers and is also examining further options for addressing the teacher supply issue in consultation with relevant interests. Since 1999, more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the BEd programme in the colleges of education. This represents a doubling of the number admitted to the programme in 1996. The total intake in the 2002-03 academic year is approximately 1,350 students. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97. There are currently some 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the Colleges of Education. I have recently announced that I will be prepared to recognise graduates of a new primary teacher training course for the purposes of primary teaching. The new course is being accredited by HETAC and it will be delivered by Hibernia College. It is important also to acknowledge that the colleges of education have done much to increase the output of primary teachers to meet the needs of schools arising from significant additional teacher allocations in recent years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">In addition to increasing the output of graduates, other initiatives have been introduced to increase the number of trained personnel. BEd graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications are now recognised as fully qualified. Montessori-trained teachers who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years' duration at St. Nicholas Montessori College, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or received the Montessori qualification awarded on completion of the three-year full-time course at the AMI college, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools and special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in  certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. I am committed to ensuring that the existing shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated within the next two to three years and in this context my Department will continue to consider new initiatives and keep existing initiatives under review.</summary>

The level of such tariffs and the terms and conditions attached also need to be examined in order to ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal. This area comes under the jurisdiction of the Commission for Communications Regulation and I have asked the commission to bring forward proposals to remedy this. Meanwhile, I will be keeping this matter under review and will continue to encourage mobile operators to address this matter themselves.

This policy direction had the specific purpose of ensuring that the regulatory framework for electronic communications plays its part in contributing to the achievement of the Government's objectives regarding the widespread availability of open-access, affordable, always-on broadband infrastructure and services for businesses and citizens on a balanced regional basis in addition to general communications objectives: greater industry sustainability, regulation only where necessary, regulatory impact assessment, consistency across platforms and with other member states, regulation of retail prices, management of the radio frequency spectrum and the establishment of a universal postal service.

          <p eId="para_1436">Cork City Council applied in December 1999 for grant-aid under the local authority swimming pool programme for the refurbishment of Churchfield swimming pool. The preliminary report for the project was received in my Department in July 2000 and approved in December 2000. This approval allowed the council to have the detailed contract documents prepared, which were received in September 2002. The contract documents were approved in December 2002, which allowed the council to invite tenders for the project. I hope to be in a position shortly to respond to the council in relation to the tender documentation as the refurbishment was received in April 2003 and is under consideration in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">The total estimated cost of the refurbishment is €8.74 million, with eligible costs under the swimming pool programme at €7.28 million. The maximum grant available under the local authority swimming pool programme is €3.8 million, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and the grant amount is capped at the time of allocation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1444">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">As the determination of eligibility for health services is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board and neither I nor my Department has a function in the matter, my Department has asked the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority to urgently examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy.

With a view to addressing concerns in this area, the commission was established in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: "To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area."

Investment in this instance is required to repair existing roofs, to improve bathrooms and to deal with pressing fire and safety issues in the existing hospital buildings. The board had originally envisaged, at the time of assessing the minor capital needs in this case, a funding requirement of approximately €150,000. However, in light of the approval given by my Department to the board on 9 October last to proceed to tender for the construction of a replacement for the existing hospital, the board, in conjunction with my Department, agreed a revised minor capital funding requirement of €110,000.

The mountain bike unit has been successful in tackling anti-social disorderly behaviour in Dublin parks and estates and works well in conjunction with other units. Overall, the unit has proven to be successful to date due to its commitment, ability to respond quickly and effectively and capacity to provide a high visibility presence.

Information is supplied to the council on a statutory basis under the Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act. Community gardaí are in close con tact with community leaders and move quickly to target areas of criminal and anti-social behaviour.

        <summary eId="sum_161">I point out to the Deputy that the board operates a priority system to deal with certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and the applicants concerned do not have to go on a waiting list. In 2002, the total number of priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 1,650 or almost 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year. In addition, managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For instance, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or of losing title to a legal remedy if legal services are delayed, the managing solicitor  can accord such cases priority status. The board constantly monitors the operation of its law centre network with a view to ensuring the maximum throughput of cases at each law centre.</summary>

Where the technology for certain, infrequently required, DNA tests is not available in this jurisdiction, a decision is made, following consultation by the gardaí and laboratory staff, to send samples abroad.

          <p eId="para_1570">Section 14 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m. This restriction does not apply on the occasion of a private function at which a substantial meal is served to persons attending the function. The term "bar" in this context is defined as any open bar or any part of licensed premises exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor and includes any  counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public. The restriction does not apply to other parts of the licensed premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1571">While the restrictions set out in the 2003 Act are in line with the recommendations of both the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the strategic task force on alcohol, I am willing to consider the possibility of alternative arrangements for functions where the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons attending the function is not permitted and where such events are properly supervised and controlled. This is a matter which I will examine in the context of the forthcoming codification of the licensing laws. My intention is that an outline of the codification Bill will be available by mid-2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_1592">A study of the prisoner transportation system was carried out in 2000 by a prisoner transportation review group comprising officials from the Irish Prison Service, the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána. It was chaired by a former Garda chief superintendent with a logistics background. Their report formed the background to a further review of the escort and transportation of prisoners in 2001-2002 which was carried out by a staffing and operations review team, SORT. In 2002, this review was in turn followed by further examination of prisoner escort patterns across the Prison Service in the context of the overall staffing and operations  review project and the preparation of a proposal for negotiation with the staff side. The focus of all these reviews was to explore more efficient ways to undertake the escort function.</p>
          <p eId="para_1593">The Irish Prison Service has proposed that the escort function should be provided from within the service by a centrally managed escort corps which would rationalise the way in which escorts are conducted. This is one element of a composite proposal for change to eliminate the perennial overtime problem in the Prison Service which has been put to the staff side and is currently the subject of a ballot.</p>
          <p eId="para_1594">Pending the outcome of that ballot it would be inappropriate to speculate on the potential cost or cost savings impact in adopting an alternative approach to the provision of prisoner escort services. As to what it would cost to contract out this service, this would be entirely dependent on the scope of the service proposed for outsourcing and on the outcome of a tendering process.</p>

It does not, however, indicate the actual strength of the Garda Síochána, but rather how best to distribute the strength at any given time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1637">The termination of the new house grant scheme was a difficult decision which the Government was required to take in order to ensure a sustainable match between Government resources and expenditure. One of the stipulations which was clearly outlined to applicants in correspondence and through advertisements in the media was that to receive the grant, people must have occupied their new homes by 13 November 2003. This deadline was adopted to achieve closure of the scheme, to allow reprioritisation of this budget provision to other housing and social programmes and to prevent speculative applications on houses that may not be built for years to come.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_164">A total of 25,329 new house grant applications were received prior to the closing date of 4 December 2002. Of these, 13,827 applications were received between 14 November and 4 December 2002, which was more than the total number of applications received in 2001. At this point, it is difficult to quantify the potential number of applicants whose houses will not be built on time and will thereby be affected by the 13 November deadline, as there are still more than  three weeks remaining for individuals who have received provisional approval to return their applications for payment. There are also queries outstanding on a significant number of grant applications, for which my Department is awaiting replies. Some of these applications may prove to be invalid.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_165">I am aware that difficulties are being faced by some housing grant applicants in meeting the deadline of completing and occupying their new homes. My Department is in the final stages of consideration of how the difficulties being faced by some applicants might be addressed. It is the firm intention of my Department to address this issue in a manner that reflects the need to ensure fair treatment for the individuals involved but also the need to achieve closure of the scheme. This consideration is being undertaken as a matter of urgency as I wish to provide clarification as quickly as possible for those people for whom compliance with the deadline is presenting problems.</summary>

An application in this instance under scéim na mbóithre áise was received by my Department on 2 April 2002. The application was examined in the usual manner. The improvement works in question did not qualify for a grant under the conditions of the scheme because there were no dwellings on the road. Grants are available under this scheme for repair of county council roads, not to exceed 50% of cost, and for repair of access roads and bog roads, for which 100% of the cost is available for qualified applicants. In the case of access roads not classified as council roads, these roads must serve at least one residence and one landowner, except in exceptional circumstances where medical or suitable third-party certification is provided. It is understood that the circumstances have since changed and on this basis the case is now being re-examined and it will be considered with other cases when funding is next being allocated.</p>

      <b>Mr. Crowe</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      her proposals to tackle child poverty.
      [24393/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_473">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1645">The reduction and eventual ending of child poverty is a top priority for me and for the  Government. The causes of child poverty, as for poverty generally, are multi-faceted and combating it requires a range of measures and interventions. Strategies to address child poverty and the measures to give effect to them are set out in the revised national anti-poverty strategy, the national children's strategy and the more recent national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. The overall target is to reduce the number of children who are consistently poor to below 2% by 2007 and if possible, eliminate consistent poverty for children by then.</p>
          <p eId="para_1646">Significant progress has already been made in achieving the 2007 goal in the period since 1997. The results of the 2001 Living in Ireland survey, to be published shortly, show that the number of children who are consistently poor has more than halved in the four-year period 1997 to 2001, falling from 15.3% in 1997 to 6.5% in 2001. With this rate of progress, the elimination of consistent poverty among children by 2007 is now a realistic target. The best way of achieving a reduction in child poverty is by reducing the numbers of parents who are unemployed and the current low rate of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, is probably the main reason consistent poverty among children has fallen so much. The aim must be to maintain high levels of employment and remove obstacles to employment take-up, especially in the case of lone parents and parents with large families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1647">For those on social welfare, payments will continue to be increased in real terms, with the lower rate to be increased to €150 in 2002 terms by 2007. The basic level of child income support is to be set at 33% to 35% of the minimum adult social welfare rate by 2007. A key objective for other services is to move towards greater equality for all children in terms of access to appropriate education, health and housing. For example, in health care, one specific aim is to reduce the gap in low birth weight rates between children from the lowest and highest socio-economic groups by 10% from the 2002 level by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1648">Ending child poverty is one of the special initiatives to be undertaken under Sustaining Progress and is being chaired by the office for social inclusion in my Department. The objectives include: better medical and health services within the community for young children and their parents; priority for early education and child care facilities for disadvantaged families; ensuring every child obtains a threshold of numeracy and literacy; accelerated provision of play environments for local communities; wider availability of parenting support services for families at risk; and maximising the efficacy of child income support arrangements.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_166">The newly established Family Support Agency will strengthen the institutional framework for the development of effective and responsive family support services. Family policy is currently  being reviewed more generally through a process of consultation in regional forums with family members, those who work with them and public representatives. Issues relating to the causes of child poverty and how best to remedy it come within the scope of the consultation. These issues will also feature in the international conference on families, change and European social policy being hosted by the Irish EU Presidency next May. The priority is to ensure that one outcome of these various initiatives will be a comprehensive, coherent and co-ordinated strategy for ending child poverty, which will also contribute to improving the quality of life and life chances for all our children and build on the considerable progress already made in this regard in recent years.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1650">Reductions in the numbers of staff in my Department are to be achieved over the period to the end of 2005 in line with Government policy on reducing public service numbers generally. These reductions will be achieved on a gradual basis over the period and the priority in this regard will be to minimise the effects on front-line delivery of services to the public. Restrictions on the filling of vacancies in the Department have applied from the beginning of the year and will continue. The restrictions are not being confined to any particular grade or level of staff and have regard only to the needs of the business areas concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1651">A review of the work and staffing levels in each area of the Department is under way at present aimed at ensuring that the reductions in staff numbers have the least impact on priority service delivery areas. In addition, certain efficiencies and reorganisations of work are being introduced under the terms of the Department's action plan under the Sustaining Progress agreement, which will help to reduce the impact of the staffing reductions in particular areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1654">I propose to take Questions Nos. 272 and 273 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1655">SI 527 of 2002, which came into effect on 22 November 2002, provided for the continuation until 31 December 2003 of the current levels of maximum rent, as determined by the health boards, in respect of which rent supplement is paid under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Concern was expressed at the time that the new regulations could have an adverse impact on social welfare recipients' ability to secure accommodation in the private rented sector and could lead to people becoming homeless. There has been an increase of more than 6,000 in the number of recipients since the regulations were introduced. This significant increase of more than 11% in the number of rent supplement recipients since last November shows that the anticipated adverse impact did not occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_1656">I am not aware of any individual being made homeless as a result of the regulations. I am aware of cases where rents were reduced to the prescribed levels and other cases where no increase in rent was sought by the landlord. The privately owned rent index published by the Central Statistics Office shows that rent levels have been falling consistently since April 2002. In light of all of this evidence, I am satisfied that the action taken has not had an adverse effect on the position of social welfare recipients in securing private rented accommodation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1658">The person concerned applied for carer's allowance on 17 August 1999. The conditions for receipt of carer's allowance are that  full-time care and attention is required and being provided and that the means test which applies is satisfied. Her carer's allowance was awarded from 19 August 1999. Following a review of entitlement, she was disallowed carers allowance with effect from 30 May 2001, as she was not providing full-time care and attention as prescribed in legislation. She was notified of this decision and the reasons for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1659">The person subsequently appealed the decision and her case was referred to the social welfare appeals office.

          <p eId="para_1661">The family income supplement, FIS, is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families and thereby preserve the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. A range of improvements to the family income supplement scheme, including the assessment of FIS on the basis of net rather than gross income and the progressive increases in the income limits, have made it easier for lower income households to qualify under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1662">In the 2003 budget I provided for further increases in the FIS income limits with effect from January 2003. These increases raised the weekly income limits by €17 at each point, adding an extra €10.20 to the payments of most existing FIS recipients. The average weekly payment now stands at €59.90 per week, with 12,024 families receiving a supplement under the scheme. The question of further improvements to the income thresholds is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and Government commitments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1676">One of the key objectives of the 2003 social welfare budget package was to protect and if possible enhance the real value of all rates of payment. Budget 2003 provided for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 5.1% to 7.6%. The main rates of qualified adult allowances were also increased by the same percentages, thereby ensuring that they did not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate. It is now projected, by the Department of Finance, that prices will increase by an average of 3.6% in 2003 as a whole and I particularly welcome the recent decline in the annual rate to 2.9% in September of this year. Consequently, the social welfare increases provided for in budget 2003, in both the personal and qualified adult rates of payments, have been well ahead of the projected inflation rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1677">At a time of economic uncertainty, I am committed to safeguarding the position of all social welfare recipients. The levels of increases to be provided in social welfare payments, including qualified adult payments, in the 2004 budget will have regard to trends in the cost of living, Government commitments and priorities as well as the overall Government financial position.</p>

          <p eId="para_1679">Since 1994, successive Governments have held the rate of child dependant allowance, CDA, constant while concentrating resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme, CB. Over that period, the combined CB-CDA payment has increased by more than double the rate of inflation. Child benefit is issued regardless of the employment status of the child's parents and does not contribute to poverty traps, whereas the loss of child dependent allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, child benefit is in fact more effective than child dependent allowances as a child income support mechanism when account is taken of these incentive issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1680">The Government's commitment to this policy is reflected in the substantial resources we have invested in the child benefit scheme since entering office, including an additional expenditure of €1.27 billion on child benefit when the current programme of multiannual increases is complete. We will then have moved from a position in 1994 in which 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of child dependant allowance, to a position where child dependant allowance will account for less than 33%. The issue of increasing child dependant allowance has been raised a number of times. The increased investment in the child benefit scheme by the Government in recent years has been of major benefit to families and is a most effective use of the resources available for child income support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1681">In the partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the importance of child income support arrangements is recognised, with a commitment to examine the effectiveness of current arrangements in tackling child poverty. The question of increases to the child dependant allowance will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the context of priorities generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_1683">The Government will continue its policy of providing significant increases in pensions and in this regard is committed, through the  programme for Government and Sustaining Progress, to a new target rate for the basic pension of €200 per week, to be achieved by 2007. The improvements announced in the 2003 budget saw the old age contributory pension increase to €157.30 per week and the old age non-contributory pension increase to €144 per week. In addition, the Government is also committed as part of Sustaining Progress to increasing pensions over a five to ten-year period to 34% of average industrial earnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1684">Also in the programme for Government and in Sustaining Progress, the Government is committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults, aged 66 or over, to the same level as the personal rate of the old age non-contributory pension. This process had already commenced in budget 2000 and a number of special increases have been granted since then. The rate of the qualified allowance on the contributory pension now stands at €121.50 per week, which is about 84% of the maximum rate of the non-contributory pension. From October 2002, new applicants for pension can arrange for the payment of the allowance direct to their spouses or partners. Improvements for pensioners remain one of the Government's main priorities. Social welfare provision for this group will be kept under review and further improvements will be considered where appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1687">I propose to take Questions Nos. 284 and 285 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1688">At the end of September 2003, 111,650 people were receiving an old age contributory pension from my Department. A further 85,859 were receiving a retirement pension and 86,996 were receiving an old age non-contributory pension. The balance between means tested and social insurance-based old age pension has shifted significantly in recent years with the latter now accounting for some 69% of pensions paid. This can be attributed to the progressive extension of social insurance, which has resulted in an increasing number of those reaching the age of 66 qualifying for a contributory-based pension. This is in keeping with Government policy aimed at ensuring that the majority of workers, including the self-employed, are covered for non-means tested pensions under social insurance.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_167">In addition, improvements in the qualifying conditions of old age contributory pension, such as the recent pre-53 pension, have broadened the scope of entitlement of those who would otherwise not have qualified for a contributory pension or non-contributory pension by reason of not satisfying the means test.</summary>

      if her attention has been drawn to the policy of the South-Western Area Health Board to cap the rent allowance at a figure substantially below the average rents in the Dublin area; if her attention has been further been drawn to the fact that this policy is forcing people to become homeless, as in the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12; if steps can be taken to remedy this in the case of this person; and if this policy can be changed.

          <p eId="para_1690">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation needs. The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the health board and neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">One of the conditions for receipt of rent supplement is based on the amount of rent a person may incur. Each health board sets a limit on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur, taking the household size and other relevant circumstances into account. This is to ensure that the rent is reasonable and that the health board is not subsidising the cost of overly large or overly expensive accommodation. On 22 November 2002, I introduced regulations which provided for holding the maximum rent levels until the end of December 2003 at the values that had been set by the health boards at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1692">The legislation governing rent supplements allows health boards to exceed their maximum reasonable rent limits in cases where, in the opinion of the board, exceptional circumstances exist. I am not aware of any case in which action by the health board has resulted in any individual being made homeless. The South-Western Area Health Board was contacted on behalf of the individual in question and has advised that on receipt of a recent rent supplement review form it came to the board's attention that the rent being charged in this case had increased to €1,250 per month. The maximum reasonable rent limit appropriate to the individual's circumstances is €950.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_168">The health board is satisfied that accommodation is available at the maximum rent levels it has set. This is borne out by the numbers of  people receiving rent allowance who are paying rent at or below that level. In the opinion of the board no exceptional circumstances exist which would warrant exceeding the appropriate rent limit. In accordance with standard practice in such instances, the individual in question was advised by the community welfare officer that her new rent was in excess of the appropriate limit and that payment of her current rent supplement would continue for a period of six to eight weeks in order to provide her with an opportunity to secure more reasonably priced accommodation or  seek a reduction in the rent being charged by the landlord.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_169">On the matter of changing the current policy, I consider that setting higher maximum rent limits than are justified by the open market would distort the rental market, leading to a general rise in rent levels that would disadvantage people on low incomes. A decision will be taken in the near future on the levels that will apply in 2004, following consideration of the exceptional cases as notified by the health boards, updated information from the Central Statistics Office and submissions which have been sought from the health boards.</summary>
