I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted the notices to my office.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a comprehensive statement about, and answer questions on, the disappearance of crucial files from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform relating to the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and to discuss the need for an immediate and thorough investigation into this situation and whether the files can be recovered to facilitate further inquiries into these atrocities.

For tomorrow's sitting it is proposed to impose guillotines on four Bills.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I will oppose the late sitting when we come to it. Proposals have been put to the Government Whip from all of the Opposition parties to properly and fairly convene the Dáil in full normal plenary session on Friday to allow for Leaders' Questions, Order of Business, Question Time, the Adjournment and so on. On that basis, this side of the House is more than happy to co-operate with the Government.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	11	A Cheann Comhairle, if you are allowing comments on each of the later items—

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I will come back to it, but I support the view expressed by Deputy Rabbitte.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The procedure for dealing with Report Stage of a Bill in this House is already very restricted in terms of the time allowed for the comments a Member can make on amendments. There is no point in the Government coming up with guillotine motions to add to the guillotine that is already in Standing Orders for debate on Report Stage. This House should be given proper time to debate Report Stages of Bills and guillotines should not be imposed. We do not approve of this approach which the Government always seems to come up with.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I concur with that comment. We had the farcical situation last night on Report Stage of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003 when amendments were introduced that were not even reached during the debate. In the case of those amendments which were reached, we were not given the opportunity for adequate discussion.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	21	That is not true.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	That is not true. Deputy Rabbitte was not in the Chamber anyway.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I watched the performance of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, on the monitor last night. I was immensely impressed by the depth of his lack of knowledge of the amendments.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	35	This is not the way to organise Report Stage. Under Standing Orders, it is restricted as to who may speak for how long and how frequently. It is regrettable that we have to resort to the guillotine in this fashion.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	36	It has become a feature of this Administration that more and more legislation is rushed through the House without adequate time to be considered by Members.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	37	That is because the Deputy is holding up the Order of Business.

We have seen the consequences of this unseemly haste with the debacle of the European Arrest Warrant Bill 2003. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to talk to the Chief Whip and the Taoiseach so that we—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	39	We are dealing with proposal No. 3.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I know. This is the point. Legislation is being rushed through the House when business should be conducted in a more orderly and considered fashion. Sooner or later, we will get things badly wrong in this House.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Is the proposal for the sitting and business of the Dáil tomorrow agreed to?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	42	No. The Friday sittings approach adopted by the Government is a farce.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	43	We are simply trying to get legislation passed.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Members have no opportunity to raise questions with Ministers or the Taoiseach. There is no Order of Business and no divisions. It is simply a way of getting business through without any real participation from the House. All of the parties recognise that we need sensible Friday sittings and to modernise procedures.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	45	It is not sensible to keep calling a quorum during a Friday sitting.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The Government, therefore, has to introduce Dáil reform and not persist with the current Friday arrangements which are simply for the convenience of the Executive. It has nothing to do with making Parliament more relevant. It is regrettable that the Aer Lingus Bill 2003 will be guillotined tomorrow at 1 p.m. when many Members wish to speak on it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The Government Chief Whip is chairperson of the Dáil reform committee which she has refused to convene this session. Some 22 Bills were promised and only three have been produced so far. Having had a paucity of business in the early stages of this Government, it is now proposed that we guillotine no less than four measures on a cosmetic Friday sitting. With the greatest respect, it is not the way to organise business in this House. I object on behalf of the Labour Party.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I agree with the comments made by Deputies Richard Bruton and Rabbitte. If the House is sitting tomorrow, will the Tánaiste make time available for a debate as to why Ireland was not awarded a contract for the reconstruction of Iraq, as Ireland so ably assisted George W. Bush in its destruction? Does the Tánaiste not feel it is ingratitude on the part of the Americans?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I welcome the Barron report on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and thank Mr. Justice Barron for his work. I understand how it brings back the pain for the victims' families which has been unremitting through the last 30 years. It is pleasing to see that many of the families see this report as an important step in the process of bringing closure.The report raises important questions and suggests shortcomings the way in which the follow-up inquiry was handled. It leaves the unmistakable impression that forces outside of the paramilitary groups may have been at work and have not yet been brought to account. It also raises questions as to the level of co-operation that was obtained from the British authorities for Mr. Justice Barron's work. I hope the committee will be able to address these important questions. I am glad to see that the appropriate Oireachtas committee will meet the relatives to give an opportunity to find a way forward to deal with outstanding issues and, hopefully, bring closure for them. I welcome this important step in that process.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Deputy Richard Bruton has rightly pointed out that the matter is before the appropriate Oireachtas committee, but I will hear comments from the four Opposition parties with a comment then by the Tánaiste.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I welcome the publication of the Barron report and thank Mr. Justice Barron for the painstaking work put into it. I acknowledge that the serious matters that are the subject of the report have now been referred, in the first instance, to the appropriate Oireachtas committee.Given the horror of the atrocities that were committed, it would be appropriate before the House rises for the Christmas recess if the Tánaiste agreed to an initial debate in the House on the report. Our citizens would expect no less than that the Dáil, having received the report, would have an initial debate after all Members had an opportunity to consider in some detail the findings, terms and context of the report and the environment that obtained in the country in 1974.When will the Nally report and the Cory report be published? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took the Nally report in August and promised he would publish as much of it as he could put in the public domain as quickly as possible. The Cory report was taken in October and again the Taoiseach has committed to publishing it without delay consistent with the usual prudent obligations. When will those two reports be in the public domain as they also deal with matters of the utmost gravity?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	52	On behalf of the Green Party, I welcome the publication of the Barron report. We should have a debate on it in the House before Christmas. The report has not brought closure for the families, many of whom are disappointed with it. While I do not want to pre-empt the discussions of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, does the Government still have an open mind on holding a public inquiry? Does the Tánaiste understand the continuing pain of the families? Will she meet them and will the Taoiseach continue to meet them to discuss the possibility of such a public inquiry?
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Along with my colleagues, I welcome the publication of the Barron report. From the report it is evident that there is an indication of British state collusion in this matter. My party has continually called for a public inquiry. The people of Monaghan and Dublin, the victims of this terrible atrocity, deserve a full public inquiry into what happened on that date. The House needs to send a loud and clear message that nothing else will suffice for or do justice to the families of the victims of that atrocity on which there is very substantial evidence of British state involvement.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I raised a crucial matter under Standing Order 31 this morning.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Chair has ruled on the matter.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Will the Tánaiste comment on the disappearance of files from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is a separate issue to that to be investigated by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	61	It is unfair that you want to silence people in the House on such a matter, a Cheann Comhairle.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I have raised this repeatedly with the Taoiseach over the past five years.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	65	It is unfair.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I join other Members in expressing my appreciation to Mr. Justice Barron for this report and also for the work done by the late Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, who began the task before his untimely death. The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were unspeakable and cowardly acts against humanity resulting in 34 people losing their lives. Many more were injured. As Deputies have acknowledged, the pain and suffering continues today and will probably be with the families forever. The Government is always willing to meet the groups representing the families, including Justice for the Forgotten, and they have acknowledged that. In the light of Deputy Rabbitte's request, I will discuss with the Whip whether it is desirable to have a debate in the House before we adjourn for the Christmas recess.The report is now with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and the Government will be anxious to see what recommendation comes from that committee. Every Member of the House can contribute to and participate in its work. We would welcome widespread participation in this.I discussed the Nally report with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning. He has the report and is anxious to publish it as quickly as possible.

In page 3, lines 5 and 6, to delete "THE BROADCASTING COMMISSION OF IRELAND" and substitute "RADIO TELEFÍS ÉIREANN".Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 seek to address what the Labour Party considers to be the central problem of this Bill. The Labour Party supported strongly the increase in the RTE licence fee on the basis of the development of greater accountability, transparency and a commitment by the public service broadcaster to carry out a wide range of additional functions and engage in additional programme making to benefit the viewing public. My party's central problem with the Bill as it stands is that it seeks to establish the mechanism of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, or BCI, through which a portion of the licence fee will be diverted to a new broadcasting fund. This raises many issues about the editorial role of the BCI and the possible future development by Government of other methods by which it could restrict the ability of the public service broadcaster to independently and sufficiently carry out its functions.As I said on Second Stage, the noted commentator Fintan O'Toole has stated that revenue lies at the heart of independence for public service broadcasting. Over the history of RTE, the State has sought at times to interfere unduly in the operation of the station. Therefore, the Labour Party regards this legislation as the thin end of the wedge in terms of licence funding. Throughout the world, we see the spectacle of growing commercialisation of broadcasting and alleged interference with editorial control in the operation of many satellite, cable and commercial channels. Punches are pulled or, as in the case of FOX News, stations become mere cheerleaders of government policy rather than its independent critics. The Labour Party takes fundamental issue with the road down which the Minister has chosen to go in this instance.It would have been more appropriate to introduce this Bill after the publication of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland Bill. Major broadcasting proposals will be brought forward through the legislation in which we will see how the Minister intends to formulate the new body to regulate broadcasting. The authority will adopt key functions which are currently carried out by the RTE authority. Would it not have been better, therefore, for the Minister to wait until the role of the new authority had been clarified and until we had seen with what commissioning functions, if any, it will be tasked? In the meantime, we are providing the broadcasting commission with extensive powers in respect of the funding scheme despite the fact that it is in its last months of effective operation.The timing of the Bill is inappropriate. The Minister would have done better to examine the role of the broadcasting authority, its membership, its broadcasting policy and commissioning remit, if any. Over the coming months, the existence of this fund will raise the issue of a dual mandate for the BCI which will have both a regulating and a programming function through its role in formulating the structure of the funding scheme. It would have been better to provide responsibility for the scheme to the public service broadcaster. That is the Labour Party's core objection to this Bill.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	124	We had a similar debate on Committee Stage last week. It is important that the development and administration of the scheme is separate from any individual broadcaster. For this reason, responsibility for the scheme has been assigned to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and will pass to the broadcasting authority in due course. The amendments tabled by Deputy Broughan would have the effect of assigning responsibility for the scheme to RTE. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage the production of additional quality programmes by all broadcasting services, not just RTE. Given that RTE may apply for funds under the scheme, the preparation and administration of the scheme by RTE would represent an unacceptable conflict of interest.As it is important that the development and administration of the scheme is separate from any individual broadcaster, these roles have been assigned to the broadcasting commission. It is likely that RTE would not like to be presented with such a conflict of interest. I cannot accept the amendments tabled by Deputy Broughan for the reasons I have outlined.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 3, line 9, after "PROJECTS" to insert ", INCLUDING CAPTIONING PROJECTS".The fact that many amendments are being discussed together provides an opportunity to speak on a matter of concern to the Opposition spokespersons. In fairness to the Minister of State, his amendment No. 21 attempts to address our concerns. The establishment under this Bill of a fund, or a pool of money, to be spent on the promotion of Irish programming under a range of headings presents an opportunity to improve the level of subtitling, or captioning as it is technically called, on our television screens. I said at length on Second and Committee Stages that it would be a mistake to miss the opportunity provided by this Bill to allow independent broadcasters and RTE to apply for assistance in respect of projects that improve the levels of access to television for the deaf or the hard of hearing by providing subtitling. We will not solve our subtitling problems unless we make dramatic changes to the legislation.Although it is possible for the Government to signal its intent to fund or partially fund improved captioning services, this needs to backed up by further legislation at a later date. The Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has been instructed to negotiate with broadcasters to try to improve the levels of subtitling and captioning on our television screens. It is important that we acknowledge that RTE 1 has made progress in respect of captioning. I welcome the fact that approximately 63% of programmes on RTE 1 at peak times are captioned. It is unfortunate that the figures in respect of Network 2 are not as impressive. The record of TV3 in providing captioning or subtitles has not been impressive. I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, but I understand that "Coronation Street" is the only programme on TV3 that is captioned.It is clear that we need to make progress. The BCI will be responsible for taking charge of the fund being established under this Bill and deciding how to spend it in support of certain programmes. This responsibility will probably be given to the BAI in future. I am glad that the Government's amendment No. 21, which I am sure the Minister of State will comment on in a moment, seems to attempt to provide for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing. I would like to clarify the rationale underlying some of my amendments.Amendment No. 2 relates to the Title of the Bill. We feel that the Title, which states that the BCI will prepare "a scheme or schemes for the funding of grants to support certain radio and television programmes and projects", needs to be strengthened. The Bill would be strengthened by adding the words "including captioning projects" after the word "projects". I do not feel strongly enough about the amendment to push it to a vote, but I would like the Minister of State and his advisors to consider whether it is necessary.Amendment No. 14 relates to section 2 of the Bill. This section is central to the legislation because it sets out what the fund will be spent on and clarifies its purpose. It is important that this section be strongly worded to signal our intent to companies such as TV3, which will not be persuaded to provide significant levels of captioning and subtitling from the goodness of its heart. It is a commercial operator which is under some financial pressure. The provision of captioning and subtitling on television programmes costs significant amounts of money. TV3 will not provide captioning until we have taken two measures. We should offer it some financial assistance to ensure it can put in place such services. We should pass laws that set targets which must be achieved by TV3. It is a debate for another day.The Minister of State said on Committee Stage that he is not satisfied that we should spend public moneys on assisting private broadcasters to provide captioning. He suggested that they should provide such services without the assistance of public moneys. RTE would not have achieved the level of service it has achieved if it had not been in receipt of such funds. Some 63% of programming on RTE 1 at peak times is subtitled because we pay a licence fee which is used well by RTE. If we are to demand that TV3 should reach similar levels of service, as I believe we should, we have to offer it a means of applying for assistance. I do not suggest that we should fund subtitling on TV3 in full, but partial funding assistance should be provided so the captioning and subtitling service we want can be made available. The Minister wants such a service.I recognise that the Department has come some way towards trying to meet the Opposition's concerns, and I look forward to listening to the Minister of State outline his rationale behind the changes he is introducing under amendment No. 21. I thank him for it.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	127	In amendment No. 15, I urge the insertion, after "literacy", of "and measures including captioning or subtitling to improve access to television programmes". It is extraordinary that, at this late stage, we should have to insist that this be included in the legislation. It might have been expected under equality legislation and under the normal democratic workings of our country that national broadcasters, be they in the public or commercial sectors, would have set themselves targets long ago and fulfilled in so far as is possible technically the aim of having 100% of programmes captioned. A significant group of our fellow citizens have a hearing disability. Obviously they want to follow all the key current affairs and sports programmes. It is a serious state of affairs that we have not insisted on that.As Deputy Coveney rightly concedes, it is an expensive business. It requires the employment of technical staff and the utilisation of equipment. Technically, it has been possible for a long time. I commend RTE 1 once again on the quantity of programmes it has captioned in recent years and for its determination to bring about a situation where the output of that station, Network 2 and TG4 is 100% captioned. The Opposition has witnessed an intense campaign by the Irish Hard of Hearing Association, the Irish Deaf Society and others over the last year or two to try to resolve the situation.To the Minister of State's credit, he has come forward with amendment No. 21, in which he states: "The Commission, in preparing a scheme, shall have regard to the understanding and enjoyment of television programmes under the scheme by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing."  My only problem is that it is not prescriptive enough. It does not lay down an absolute law that a percentage of programmes under the fund will be captioned. It is a step forward, but it does not go far enough. Any of the amendments tabled by the three Opposition Deputies here would go that little bit further. My own would clearly indicate that measures must be taken to ensure that programmes commissioned under the fund are fully accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing.We had a debate last night on the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill produced by my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is present. We heard the Government's response to it regarding the role of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. That obviously has a wide remit and a clear responsibility regarding the access rules under a European directive. I only got a chance to speak on it for about five minutes last night, but it was a valuable Bill on children's advertising. The BCI is obviously engaged in a long consultation programme, which I imagine will not end properly until perhaps the middle of next summer. It could follow exactly the key issues put forward by Deputy Eamon Ryan in his Bill.However, one of the problems that I have with the organisation is that those desirable aims seem to be realised so slowly. In the case of children's advertising, on the BCI website at least, it is encouraging to see how it has tried to engage with the public on the issue, especially with children. However, I am not sure that there has been the same engagement with people who are hard of hearing or if there is the same determination to bring forward rules on access. Why could it not have been done heretofore? While welcoming the Minister's amendment No. 21, I feel that the Labour Party amendment No. 15 is stronger. I accept my colleague's amendments too. They are more prescriptive and would make for better law. Given that we have a significant obligation to citizens with disabilities, we should lay down the law on this matter and say that we want captioning from national television broadcasters – full stop.

I commend the Minister of State on going some of the way. In fairness to him, he has entered into the spirit of our amendments. In hindsight, it is possibly a pity that we did not have an amendment which required every programme made with this funding to be subtitled. I do not know how he could have done that. However, that is perhaps the level of forward thinking in which we should be engaged. It may not be possible at this stage to achieve that, but at least we have signalled our intent in the Bill, and one hopes that it will encourage programme makers and the commission to move towards ensuring that every programme produced as a result of the fund is subtitled.I praise RTE for being a commendable example of the benefits of public service obligations on companies with such remits in that it strives to achieve what is right. We must also acknowledge that, while we praise the Minister for the wording and agreeing to meet some of the concerns of the Opposition amendments, we have a great distance to go on this matter, especially regarding our regulation of commercial broadcasters. I hope that approval of the amendment is not seen as our having properly addressed this issue. We will have to revisit it and ensure that all have proper access to broadcasting produced in this country or bought in from other jurisdictions. I commend the Minister once again on the amendment he has tabled.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Before the Minister replies, I wish to make a final comment. I have been studying his amendment while the other two Opposition speakers had the floor. To be fair, the Minister's amendment deals with amendment No. 18 in my name, which concerns the issue that Deputy Eamon Ryan has just raised, namely, that all programmes funded under the scheme should be fully accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. In other words, we suggest to the BCI that any programme it funds under the scheme should have captioning. That is welcome.The problem with the Minister's amendment, as I read it – and I hope Members will correct me if I am wrong – is that it does not deal with amendment No. 14 in my name or with amendments Nos. 15 or 17. Their intent is that part of that pool of money be reserved for applications by independent broadcasters which need some assistance in providing captioning or subtitling.There are two separate issues. The Minister has dealt with the first, which is that projects funded under this Bill be captioned, since they should be accessible to those who are deaf or hard of hearing. The Minister's amendment deals with that, and I commend him on it. The other side of the coin is, in my view, almost more important.Some programmes will be funded under this scheme but they will not form the majority of programmes shown on television. The more important issue is whether we will allow anyone to apply for assistance to provide more subtitling or captioning on televisions screens, for example, TV3. For example, are there provisions for TV3 to approach the BCI with a proposal to subtitle certain prime time television programmes, such as news and current affairs programmes, which many people would like to access? The broadcaster may need assistance in setting up a captioning unit or upgrading equipment to provide subtitling, but the Bill does not provide funding for that aspect when it should.I do not want to be mean-spirited because the Minister of State has come some way towards ensuring that the programmes which are supported will require captioning. However, it is more important to ensure TV3 and other independent broadcasters, such as community stations, can provide for captioning and can get some assistance for doing so from this pool of money. This is not addressed by the Minister of State's amendment.

#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	131	We have had an excellent debate on Committee Stage and again on this Stage on the area of subtitling and captioning. There was broad agreement that subtitling is an important issue and we agreed to consider it seriously for this Stage, which we have done.Funds will not be made available for existing programmes on RTE and TV3 because it is outside the scope of the Bill. Nonetheless, we have sought to address Deputies' concerns in regard to programmes funded under this scheme.Amendment No. 21 in my name provides: "The Commission, in preparing a scheme, shall have regard to the understanding and enjoyment of television programmes under the scheme by persons who are deaf or hard of hearing."  This is a reasonable way to proceed as it requires the BCI to take account of the issues and concerns raised during this debate. It requires the BCI to take into account the ability of persons who are deaf or hard of hearing to enjoy programmes funded under the scheme.In regard to existing programmes on RTE 1, Network 2 and TV3, the BCI is currently examining the area of subtitling and captioning and the issue is best left to it. The Bill deals particularly with the special programmes to be initiated under its provisions.With regard to the point raised by Deputy Eamon Ryan, I expect the BCI to take on board the amendment which we have tabled today and, as far as possible, the programmes produced will be subtitled or captioned. There may be some programmes which are unsuitable. For instance, I understand there is a difficulty in regard to subtitling live events. However, I expect the BCI to take on board the spirit of the amendment and to seek to ensure that the programmes which are prepared will have a subtitled content.

I wonder if amendment No. 21 goes far enough. It states that the commission, in preparing a scheme, "shall have regard to the understanding and enjoyment of television programmes under the scheme. . . ". It could be interpreted that any programmes under the scheme should be captioned. Why can that not be stated? A number of Fine Gael amendments are more specific in regard to whether this applies to the literacy aspect or to programming. In that context, perhaps the funding could be specifically geared in order to assist broadcasters to meet the remit of captioning.This is a valuable step forward and, as is always the case with the Minister of State, he has listened to comments from the Opposition and has attempted to meet them. However, the amendment does not go far enough. This is a golden opportunity. Therefore, will the Minister of State make it stronger in order that we could say we had clarified this aspect of the fund for the benefit of people with hearing disabilities?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I welcome the Minister of State's intentions in amendment No. 21 and, on that basis, I will withdraw amendment No. 18 because he has addressed what I try to state in it, namely, that all programmes under this scheme need to be captioned or subtitled. In other words, they need to be accessible to people who are deaf of hard of hearing. The Minister of State has attempted to do that in a fair manner.I will not withdraw amendment No. 14 because it deals with a different issue, which the Minister of State indicates is outside the remit of the Bill. However, we should ensure it is within the remit and I see no reason it cannot. If we are providing for archiving, which is within the remit of the Bill, I see no reason we should not provide for subtitling or captioning. If the Bill was dealing purely with providing programmes to outline Irish history, culture and the other issues provided for under section 2, it would be difficult to introduce a new section on captioning or subtitling. However, when there are new sections dealing with improving adult literacy and the development of archiving of programme material produced in the State, the Bill is clearly dealing with issues outside of programme content. Within that remit there should be assistance to those involved in improving captioning and subtitling services on television. For that reason, I will press amendment No. 14 and will withdraw amendment No. 2 since my point is made on amendment No. 14.

The BCI is already considering the issue of subtitling. When it makes its report or issues recommendations, it may require broadcasters to pay from their own resources. The BCI was given that power by the House. We expect that it will report reasonably soon. It would be wrong to use some of the limited money in the fund to do what Deputy Coveney suggests. I appreciate the impetus behind the Deputy's amendment and I am aware that we need to deal with the issue of subtitling as it relates to the national and other broadcasters. However, the Bill is the wrong mechanism to use in that regard. While I accept what Deputy Coveney has said, I cannot make provision in the Bill for the matter with which the amendments deal because it falls outside the scope of the legislation.

The section deals with definitions and interpretations and states that "commission" means the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The amendment on Committee State suggested that the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, should it be established, should also be included here. The Minister of State indicated that we could not include the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in a Bill when it does not yet exist. If plans change in the next six to eight months and the authority is not established, it would be stupid to have it included in legislation.Acceptance of amendment No. 4 would mean that the definition would state that "commission""means the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and its successors". This is a technical point I thought I would put forward for the Minister of State's consideration. If the amendment is not necessary, I will be happy to withdraw it.

In page 4, lines 12 and 13, to delete "and submit to the Minister for his or her approval".Amendment No. 6 seeks to delete the phrase "and submit to the Minister for his or her approval". I expressed concern on Second and Committee Stages about the level of ministerial control that might exist in respect of the schemes that would operate under the fund. The Minister of State will say that this does not give the Minister direct control over programming, but it will give him a great deal of influence over the type of issues which may, under the legislation, be considered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland or the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has not spoken on any Stage of the Bill in the Dáil, indicated in the Upper House that broadcasting should be left to the broadcasters. That is his mantra. He stated on several occasions in the Seanad that broadcasting is the remit of broadcasters and the Oireachtas provides the conditions in which they, through the RTE Authority or the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, operate. Having created a level playing pitch and set down standards in respect of public sector broadcasting, the operation of advertising, etc., we then let broadcasters make whatever programmes they want.The difficulty with the Bill is that it appears to require strict invigilation on the part of the Minister in respect of the scheme as it will emerge. It must be said that the Bill contains desirable ideals in respect of new programmes on history, historical buildings, the natural environment, folk, rural and vernacular heritage, traditional and contemporary arts and our native language. I tried to add programmes on science to that list on Committee Stage. The Bill also deals with the development of archiving of the audio-visual record of our nation. These are laudable objectives but I am concerned about the extent to which the Minister might be able to interfere with the operation of the scheme.As already stated, amendment No. 6 seeks to remove the requirement that the scheme be submitted to the Minister. In other words, the scheme should be operated, under this legislation, by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and its successor.Amendment No. 23 seeks to delete lines 38 to 40 regarding the amendment of the scheme. Section 2(5) states that a scheme submitted to the Minister may be amended or revoked by the commission. Section 2(6) gives the Minister power to direct the commission or to make changes to the amendments to schemes. The Minister and his successors are, therefore, given an extensive remit under these provisions. The mantra the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, repeated in the Upper House in respect of leaving broadcasting to broadcasters should guide our way forward.I am concerned about this matter and I support Deputy Eamon Ryan who has tabled an amendment which provides a safeguard by suggesting that any amendment to the scheme should be presented to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. We, as representatives of the viewing and listening public, would then at least be in a position to comment at that stage.I am nervous about this process. We have only a small fund and the Minister of State said it may cost approximately €400,000, out of €7 million or €8 million, to administer this process. Perhaps, as a result of index-linked licence fees, the fund may become reasonably substantial. One of the criticisms in this regard, when put in the context of domestic programming made by RTE, is that the fund would cover only one reasonably good television series. We are speaking about a relatively small amount which could become important as time goes on.We should not provide for the Minister to be in a position to manipulate the general remit of experienced broadcasters or those who have an interest in communications. We are opposed to the principle of removing part of the licence fee in this fashion. At least if it proceeds, the new commissioning agent will be independent in terms of how it operates the fund as required by this legislation. I will press amendment No. 6.

Deputy Broughan makes a valid point on the necessity for maintaining a gap between us, as politicians, and broadcasters who should be independent in their decisions on editorial policy. Our first principle is to ensure broadcasting is removed from political interference or control so it can mirror society. I am not sure which official from RTE said that. I am not too sure what reflection of society we would get if the mirror were in the Minister's hands. I support Deputy Broughan's general point on the need to put a safe distance between us, as politicians, and any broadcasting decision.Deputy Broughan's point relates to the overall scheme. My amendment No. 25 is tabled because I fear we are, if we pass the legislation as drafted, not only giving the Minister control in terms of approval of the overall scheme but also in subsection (6) saying that he may direct the commission to support a specific television or radio programme. The Minister is being given the power to say "Yes" or "No" to an application by a specific programme for funding.To my mind, the Minister is not acting as a policymaker or legislator in this regard but as a programme producer. The first thing I would do, if I were a producer seeking to have my programme made, is put my case to the Minister. People believe it is who one knows in this country that matters and that, if one provides a little encouragement, one's programme will be funded by the scheme. I raised on Committee Stage the question of why the Minister believed he should have the power to direct the commission to include a specific programme in the scheme. However, I did not get clarification on that point.I have maintained amendment No. 25 as drafted on Committee Stage. Providing that any decision by the Minister to grant funding to a specific programme will have to be put before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources means any such direction will be made public. If my amendment is not accepted, that provision will cast suspicion over any future scheme or programme which it might be suggested the Minister insisted be included in the scheme. It would be impossible to find out the truth. Acceptance of my amendment would ensure transparency and protect the Minister from such accusations.Perhaps the Minister of State can inform us when replying of the reasons the Minister might have to direct a specific programme to be included. Acceptance of my amendment will protect the Minister from accusations of corruption, favouritism and cronyism that would no doubt ensue. I am anxious to hear what the Minister of State has to say in this regard before I comment on it further.When debating the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill earlier this week, the Minister said he wanted nothing to do with decisions about the type of regulations applied to advertising. He said it was for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to decide such matters and we should not interfere in the process. He also said that, if we as legislators were to suggest amending the legislation, we would be planning on the hoof and pre-empting the process. I disagree with him in that regard. I understand his argument but find it difficult to accept the same Minister stating he should have the power under this Bill to say "Yes" or "No" about funding for individual programmes.I hope the Minister has taken on board my concerns as expressed on Committee Stage and that he is in a position to accept my amendment. I believe the wording used provides the right approach. I had considered deleting the section but decided against that because the Minister may well have reason to amend, revoke or direct the commission regarding a specific programme. I cannot think right now of a reason he would need to do so, but one may arise in future. Should that be the case, we must ensure the process is open and transparent. The best way to ensure that is to provide that such decisions be brought before the appropriate committee for approval. No doubt the Government would have a majority and, as a result, this provision would not necessarily limit or hinder the Minister. However, it would ensure his decisions were made public. I hope the Minister of State will accept my argument and my amendment.Deputy Broughan raised a valid point about whether the Bill allows the Minister to have too broad a contact with broadcasters. The specific example I have given and the purpose of amendment No. 25 are of major importance for the future of broadcasting in this country. To allow us to go in the direction of the Minister becoming, in effect, a producer and where there is no separation between him and the broadcaster would have serious consequences for the future of broadcasting.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I support Deputies Broughan and Eamon Ryan on this issue. I am not as concerned about amendment No. 6 as I am about amendments Nos. 23, 24 and 25. I understand that the Minister, as policymaker, would require the BCI to seek clearance on the details of a scheme on broadcasting policy prepared by it for him or her.I understand from where the Minister is coming on this. He is responsible for policy. The schemes, when completed, will relate to broadcasting policy and management of the fund. I understand that the Minister would wish to see the details of the scheme, improve it and ensure it was in line with what was intended when this legislation was first introduced. Having said that, I would like those schemes to be submitted to the committee for scrutiny by Opposition spokespersons. It would be sensible to do this. The Minister of State has a fair indication of the interest we have in this area.Amendments Nos. 23 to 25, inclusive, are the most important from my perspective. I cannot understand why amendment No. 22 has not been grouped with them. The concerns strongly outlined by Deputy Eamon Ryan, and strongly supported by Deputy Broughan and I, both today and on Committee Stage, seem to be dealt with in amendment No. 22. Perhaps the amendment was introduced too late for it to be grouped for the purpose of debate. Amendment No. 22 seems to deal with the concerns expressed regarding section 2(6)(a), whereby the Minister was granting himself the ability to veto or insist on individual radio or television programmes being included on a funding scheme. That would have been outrageous. It would also have been entirely inconsistent with the trend in legislation coming from the Department as it seeks to remove the Minister from the micro-management of schemes or funding. An example of this approach is the issue of fish licences, where the Minister is trying to move away from interference, not on policy, but on its implementation.Section 2(6)(a) provides that the Minister may direct the commission, “to support in a scheme a television or radio programme. . . ”. Had that been the case, people would lobby the Minister for inclusion in schemes for funding. This would have been a retrograde step and a mistake. The Minister of State has addressed this and proposes to delete subsection 6(a), lines 34 to 37, and introduce a much softer wording on approving a scheme as opposed to approving the detail of a scheme. While this is to be welcomed, I still consider that amendments Nos. 23 to 25, inclusive, have a point and I am anxious to hear the response from the Minister of State.

Deputy Coveney is correct, it should have been grouped with the amendments now before us. Perhaps the Minister of State can outline in detail what is his intent. It is difficult for us to discover this when we receive ministerial amendments on an important issue only at the last minute. On my first reading of the amendment, I am unsure whether it clears up my concerns, particularly those I hold on section 2(6)(a). I do not understand the exact intent of this.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	146	In its wisdom, the Bills Office decides on the grouping of amendments. Amendment No. 22 seeks to allay the fears and concerns raised on Committee Stage. As Deputy Coveney has said, since we came into the Department, both the Minister and I have tried to ensure that the Minister would have no role other than policy direction. The Minister would not want to be involved with programme makers or broadcasters of the type of programmes that will be initiated under the Bill.I now turn to the amendments before us. The approval by the Minister of a scheme and laying it before the Oireachtas is important as there must be accountability. The detail of the scheme is still a matter for the BCI and relates to administrative arrangements, grant rates, assessment criteria, payment arrangements, etc. Therefore, I do not consider it to be a matter for approval by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, the committee can, at any time, call the BCI to account for the programmes it makes. It can also call the Minister before it. There is no reason the committee would not consider this legislation and how it evolves.The parameters of the scheme include objectives, annual funding and reporting and reviews. These are already set out in legislation. Section 2(9) already provides that a scheme must be laid before each House as soon as may be after it is made and that either House may annul the scheme by resolution within 21 days. The House will also see that a review can be taken under section 5 and annual reports and accounts will be made under section 6. There will be many opportunities to discuss this matter if the House so wishes. Therefore, I do not propose to accept these amendments. However, I hope to be able to deal with some of the concerns raised by the Deputies on amendment No. 22.The only involvement by the Minister under this legislation will be the approval of a scheme. Laying details of the scheme before the Houses is also important. Someone must be accountable for the scheme and the Minister will eventually be accountable for any schemes put in place. However, the detail of the scheme is a matter for the BCI.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I agree that amendment No. 22 should have been grouped with these amendments. People take for granted that the House should closely invigilate public sector broadcasting, given that Members represent the licence payers. However, I have grave concerns about the close regime of accountability that has been imposed on RTE in the past year. There is a requirement for monthly reporting, while PricewaterhouseCoopers has a large remit to consider the general direction of the charter and programme commitments, etc., of the national station.There are many forces in the commercial media that are bitterly opposed to public sector broadcasting. Many of them are beholden to major advertisers – I think of the print media and property advertisers. Questions have been raised in recent years asking how dependent the print media has become on developers, auctioneers and others from this industry. The print media seems dependent on this area and one hopes it does not affect its analysis of these problems.In view of this, I am concerned about the recently introduced close invigilation of the public service broadcaster.There have been occasions of direct and gross interference by Ministers in the performance of public service broadcasting. Perhaps the overall problem is the way in which the Bill was framed. It does not acknowledge sufficiently the difficulties in this area, which need to be treated with great sensitivity. As my colleagues have said, section 2(6) states that the Minister can direct the commission "to support in a scheme a television or radio programme in relation to any particular matter mentioned in paragraph (a),
(b) or (c) of subsection (1)”. Although this will be changed, the Minister of State's new amendment No. 22 states: “(a) to prepare and submit to him or her a scheme relating to any matter in subsection (1)”. Programmes relating to the Irish language, for example, are listed under this subsection.I know there must be accountability but I would have preferred if our existing public service broadcaster could have administered a new commissioning role regarding these objectives for other broadcasting sectors. I am still concerned about the extensive power afforded to the Minister. I do not share the Minister of State's concerns about section 2(9) which stipulates that the schemes be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This presents a wide area of transparency and accountability. These Houses would obviously be able to have a role in this regard. My concern relates to the unseen actions of a bureaucracy and a Minister. I know the Minister's Department has a small budget but it is a vast Department in terms of its enabling powers regarding a huge tranche of our national life, from broadband to the fishing industry to the vital area of broadcasting.I would have preferred a different mechanism rather than that by which the Minister can inform the broadcasting commission that he is not happy with the direction it is taking and that he requires certain programmes to be broadcast. I am not saying the Minister will suggest we should have the "Dermot Ahern Show", but he may—

Having read amendment No. 22, I did not satisfy him with my response on its intent. My reading of the amendment is that it still allows for ministerial interference in the making of certain programmes. The phrase, "to amend or revoke a scheme", means the Minister can do just about anything regarding a scheme. The line, "to prepare and submit to him or her a scheme relating to any matter in subsection (1)”, gives the Minister carte blanche to do whatever he wants. Subsection (1) relates to the type of programming included.It is interesting to note that the Minister of State has not amended section 2(7), which follows the two paragraphs he is proposing to delete by way of amendment No. 22. Section 2(7) states: "Any amendment or revocation of a scheme under subsection (5) or (6) shall be submitted by the Commission to the Minister for his or her approval”. In other words, the Minister will still be able to amend or revoke a scheme.My main point is that legislation that allows a Minister to amend or revoke a scheme in private is not desirable. I wonder if we have learned anything from the tribunals which, month after month and at a cost of millions of euro, have examined the relationship broadcasters had with the then Minister regarding licensing and other arrangements in the broadcasting sector.I have no problem accepting the Minster of State's amendment if he accepts the one small but vital principle that, if the Minister of the day wishes to amend or revoke a scheme, his or her decision should be open to public scrutiny. The Minister could be a Minister of any party. I am not trying to score political points. I accept that corruption does not belong in any one party. Any corrupt principle or cronyism would be countered immediately if the Minister had to explain his or her decisions regarding the amendment of a specific funding scheme. It is a question of the allocation of money.I hope the Minister of State accepts the sense of my amendment which still applies even if amendment No. 22 is accepted. My amendment states that, where a Minister interferes directly in a funding scheme and makes changes thereto, his or her decision should be approved by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. This would immediately end any argument about cronyism, corruption or a decision having been made behind closed doors. It would avoid future tribunals of inquiry into what the Minister did or did not do to amend a scheme or to direct funding towards a specific programme.The laying of a scheme before the Oireachtas, as set out in section 2(9), is insufficient because the real cause for concern is interference by the Minister. Committee approval is a simple, cheap, democratic and fail-safe measure that would protect the Minister from accusations of corruption and cronyism to which the Bill, as amended by the Minister of State by way of amendment No. 22, will leave the Minister open.I await the Minister of State's interpretation of paragraph (a) in amendment No. 22. However, as I stated, I have no problem accepting his amendment if he accepts the need for transparent analysis of interference by a Minister in the schemes. To ensure he accepts this need, it is necessary to accept both amendments Nos. 24 and 25.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	158	My amendment proposes the deletion of lines 34 to 37 from section 2(6)(a), page 5, and to substitute the following:"(a) to prepare and submit to him or her a scheme relating to any matter in subsection (1), or(b) to amend or revoke a scheme.The Commission shall comply with a direction under this section.This amendment takes account of concerns expressed by Deputies on Committee Stage that the existing wording could be understood as allowing the Minister to direct the commission to fund a particular programme or to have a say in the programme under the scheme. That was never the intention. It was intended to enable the commission to bring forward a scheme under any of the categories in section 2(1). This provision is necessary to deal with the possibility that the commission would not prepare a scheme and I am happy to table these amendments to clarify the matter.We have four schemes on culture, heritage and experience, adult literacy, the Irish language and archiving. The only role the Minister will have will be to instruct the BCI to draw up a scheme. He or she will have no involvement or role in the detail or content of the programme. For example, if the BCI decided it was going to ignore the Irish language, that would be a scheme passed through legislation and adopted by the House. Then, in the case of a public outcry, the Minister would surely have the right to say to the BCI that the scheme had been passed by the Oireachtas and that it should be included because the public required it.I listened carefully to Deputies on Committee Stage and I took their concerns on board regarding the possibility of the Minister becoming involved in making programmes. The amendment clarifies that the Minister's only role relates to schemes being prepared or submitted to him and that he may amend or revoke a scheme. He has no role, good, bad or indifferent, in drawing up the schemes, nor would he want such a role. He made it clear, particularly in the Seanad debate, that drawing up the content of programmes would be a matter for the BCI with no involvement from the Minister whatsoever.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	159	This goes to the nub of the problem with the drafting of the Bill and the way the proposal was brought forward. The Minister of State stated the situation clearly and if something to that effect was in the Bill, which it could be, then our fears would be allayed. As it stands I still have concerns, given the past. We recall Fianna Fáil's former leader, Seán Lemass, who regarded RTE as an arm of Government to be phoned up at different times, if necessary. Other Fianna Fáil leaders, some less distinguished than others, also had a reputation for being quick to phone the national broadcaster about programmes and we also had the appalling interference with the basic commercial policy of RTE in the late 1980s when former Deputy Ray Burke was in charge of communications.We have concerns and while I understand that with funding there is a responsibility to the House for the way in which public money is spent, the drafting of the Bill is sloppy. Maybe the whole scheme is sloppy and the concerns expressed by Deputy Michael D. Higgins and me on Second Stage, and by Senator O'Meara in the Seanad, regarding the operation and development of this idea, are a result of that idea not being well thought out. Maybe it would have been better if the Minister had come forward with another national broadcaster, funded in competition with the existing broadcaster from public money, and given it a clear remit in commissioning and broadcasting. Clearly the broadcasting authority will have considerable powers regarding this fund and in the commissioning area.I am still unhappy with the carte blanche given to the Minister regarding elements of the scheme provided for in section 2.

In page 4, lines 15 and 16, to delete "Irish culture, heritage and experience" and substitute "the diversity of culture, heritage and experience on the island of Ireland".We had an interesting discussion on Committee Stage regarding the areas under which funding for programming could be granted. There are many desirable objectives. We should insert in lines 15 and 16 the words "the diversity of culture, heritage and experience on the island of Ireland" instead of the words "Irish culture, heritage and experience". In our island as a whole it is important to reflect the two main traditions of our nation and in view of developments over the past eight to ten years in particular, it is important that there is access for programmes which show the whole range of our cultural inheritance.The Minister responded on Committee Stage that he believes the words in lines 15 and 16 of section 2(1)(a) include this. We tried to broaden the subsection. Submissions were made to us when the Bill was first published on the importance of ensuring that the programming to become available under this funding would also include all aspects of the experience of people newly arrived in our country, whether they come to work or study or are fleeing from oppression. Their experience and history, which now becomes part of our national experience, should also be included. The Minister stated it is included under the term “heritage and experience” but we feel the addition of the phrase “the diversity of culture, heritage and experience on the island of Ireland”, would be more comprehensive.Amendment No. 13 relates to discussions we had when the Bill was published and, in particular, to a submission made to me and other parties by Dóchas regarding the experience of Ireland in the international context. There is a reference in section 2(1)(a)(vii) to “the Irish experience in European and international contexts”. Many of the issues which arise are based on our economic experience. The significant expansion of overseas development aid, begun by the Labour Party during the days of a partnership Government, is one of Ireland's great achievements over the past decade. We are unhappy that we have not reached the point of 0.7% aid. It is regrettable that we are no longer on target and that the 0.7% target is being pushed out because of the performance of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, over the past seven years. Nonetheless it is a large fund.

This large fund means our interaction in the development area with countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America is important. Dóchas wants us to look at the development of globalisation in economic terms. We should consider issues such as fairness regarding the production of goods in countries in the southern hemisphere, the treatment and exploitation of workers producing products for our markets, and fair trade. I have supported many initiatives in the past to ensure that globalisation happens in a fair and egalitarian manner. Amendment No. 13 seeks to allow for the inclusion of programmes along those lines and to develop further the word "contexts" used in the Bill.

This is an important section of the Bill. Earlier in this debate, I thought we might have missed a ministerial amendment. However, I checked and we have not, which is worrying. The Minister, hopefully, will accept one of our amendments, as opposed to introducing one.There is genuine concern among Opposition spokespersons and groups outside the House regarding the Bill's definition of Irish culture. The purpose of this Bill is slightly narrow in its wording, because of the reference to Irish history, historical buildings, the natural environment, Irish folk and rural heritage, and traditional and contemporary arts – I know that is an issue for Deputy Eamon Ryan – and the Irish language. The only reference to the new multicultural Ireland is the Irish experience in a European and international context. There is a concern that it did not go far enough. In essence, the result will be that the schemes will be very much directed towards Irish language and culture, in the traditional sense. Many exciting projects which may apply to Ireland in an international context, or the effect of an international environment on Ireland and its people, may not be catered for.I gave some examples of programmes on Committee Stage, such as "Race to the Bottom", an excellent programme on the influence of sweatshops in Bangladesh on the clothing industry in Derry. That was a very good example of the type of programme that could and should be funded under this scheme in the international context. Other relevant issues include the impact of people like Tom Hyland in East Timor and the subsequent impact of that on the Irish consciousness in terms of what was happening there. Many Irish people would not have been aware of East Timor's existence, never mind the detail of events there, were it not for that type of programming.In the cultural musical context, one can refer to the development of projects such as Riverdance or an Afro-Celtic form of musical development which has occurred in Ireland. The development co-operation aid aspect is also relevant. In that context, for a relatively small country, Ireland is playing a truly remarkable role in many African countries and in other areas such as Afghanistan, where Concern and GOAL are both active. There are great possibilities for enlightening people as to the impact of Irish people and organisations abroad and, indeed, the impact of foreign cultures on this country.I know the Minister of State is attempting to address that through section 2(a)(vii), but it needs further strengthening. That is the reason I introduced amendment No. 11, which proposes to add a new subsection referring to a new multicultural experience in Ireland. I hope the Minister of State will accept that in the spirit in which it is intended, which is, genuinely, to improve the legislation rather than trying to change it in any way. I believe the existing wording is not sufficient.

The idea worked so well in the film that I plan to trap the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, bring him to Carraroe in Connemara, place Bob Quinn on the other side of the operating table and carry out a face swap. I would then bring the new Minister Bob Quinn back to the Dáil to deal with the broadcasting legislation.

My idea is not solely based on Bob Quinn's leadership and ethical concern, of which the Minister could do with an injection, but also because Bob Quinn impressed me as a remarkable broadcaster. I particularly recall one of his programmes – perhaps it was part of a series – entitled "The Atlantean", which examined the connection between our Irish – supposedly Celtic – culture and a culture from north Africa, involving the Barbary tribes in Tunisia and areas around Morocco and Algeria. That outstanding television programme broadened my mind, as a young person, to the realisation of the irrelevance of national borders and how people travelled over time.If we could arrange the operation I suggested, whereby the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources had the face of Deputy Dermot Ahern and the mind of Bob Quinn, we might have a very different Bill before us. I believe the Minister, in his Bob Quinn format, would accept practically all of the amendments which have been put forward. It is that enlightened view of the world and Irish culture which is recognising our multiethnicity, our connection with other parts of the world and the remarkable phenomenon of cultural diversity which is now occurring in Ireland as new communities come in. That aspect should be celebrated in this programme which we are about to fund. Unfortunately, however, the required operation is only available in a film context, not in real life. Accordingly, we are left with our current Minister and without any amendments to the Bill, which I greatly regret.While I will not go into the full logic behind each of the amendments I proposed on Committee Stage, it is regrettable that this opportunity is not being taken to broaden the definition of Irish culture and to recognise the fact that we have many different immigrant communities which are now part of our Irish experience. This was our chance to recognise that and ensure we have programming which reflects it.A notable event in Irish life was referred to in a newspaper report today – the fact that our population has exceeded 4 million for the first time since 1871, if I recall the heading correctly. Part of that is attributable to immigration. In Bob Quinn's film, "The Atlantean", people came over great distances with the help of the trade winds. Some aspects of the present-day inflow can be very disconcerting, in terms of people coming into this country in cargo containers and landing in very difficult circumstances. Others may come because they are involved in the software industry, bringing some of the best brains in the world to help expand our economy. People come here for a variety of reasons. That is something we should celebrate by recording it in programmes and archives, as this Bill is doing. However, I regret we have not gone as far as we might have in terms of recording that new phenomenon in Irish cultural life.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I shall inform my senior Minister of Deputy Eamon Ryan's intention to make him Bob Quinn for a day. Following the debate on Committee Stage, we have reviewed the Bill and we believe its provisions are quite adequate to deal with the concerns of the Deputies opposite. The focus of the scheme is specifically on programmes relating Irish cultural heritage and experience which, in our view, is not necessarily as limited as Deputies have suggested. I cannot pre-judge the content of the scheme itself or the likely success of any programme ideas which may be put forward. However, it should be possible to develop a variety of good quality programmes which can fit within the objectives set out in the Bill. This could include programmes with a multicultural or international dimension, or which focus on the diversity of cultural heritage and experience on the island of Ireland.I remind the House – Deputy Coveney already referred to this – that one of the categories of programme specifically mentioned in the Bill is that of the Irish experience in European and international contexts. In addition, section 3(1)(d) of the Bill specifically provides that the objectives of the scheme should include a programme which would represent the diversity of Irish culture and heritage. While I am satisfied the Bill provides that the scheme is to be focused on a programme of Irish cultural heritage and experience, I do not accept that it is, in some way, inward-looking or ignoring the modern Ireland. I believe this Bill will allow the diversity of culture in the context of our European and international experience. I would expect that programme makers will be in a position to take that into account when preparing programmes.

The original point we made on this side of the House was that there should be a broader reference to the diversity of Irish culture, as it has emerged in recent years. In that context, the Minister of State should have gone a little further with the wording.

In the future, if we have schemes coming back to the committee for scrutiny, we can make reference to that statement. I do not mean to be smart in saying that.Dóchas asked that if amendments seeking to broaden the definition were not accepted would the Minister of State explain what is meant by the Irish experience in European and international contexts and in this regard his statement has been helpful. While the wording of this section could have been clearer and broader, I am happy the Minister of State has made clear its intention.

It is coincidental that the same spirit of that work needs to be replicated in the BCI decision-making process for the fund. Ireland is small island nation with a large international network of connections. When the BCI decides on funding, I hope it is made on a broad basis rather than a narrow Irish one.

In Enniscorthy, County Wexford, there is a shop called "Afroscorthy", selling African produce, which is a sign of how integrated immigrants have become. The big difficulty is that they are not allowed to work, but that is another issue.

In page 4, line 21, after " environment" to insert "and science".This amendment has arisen following submissions made to me over the last months by bodies, such as the Irish Research Scientists' Association, about the necessity for more scientific programming by the State broadcaster and to be included in the new fund. Compared to other national broadcasters, there seems to be a dearth of programmes addressing Ireland's attempts at becoming a high-tech and scientific society. In the past, areas in science were seen as too mundane to permit exciting broadcasting and programming, though the State broadcaster and the BBC have produced some good programmes on innovation and scientific development. With the rollout of broadband and the development of communications, the remit of this Department now includes an educational role in reaching the levels of development that we aspire to, such as those reached by South Korea and Japan. It is a fair request to include all aspects of science in the remit of the Bill.Amendment No. 9 proposes to insert in section 2(1)(a)(iv), after the word “heritage”, the words “social economy and the voluntary sector”. The drafters of the legislation considered that the programming of our local heritage was an important area that would be funded. However, district and local development over the last several years has included the social economy and voluntary area, an aspect that is not celebrated enough. People on the ground have created a system of self-help through district Government and economic development. I am proud to have been involved in such efforts in north Dublin city. In section 2, there is an emphasis on looking backwards. However, recent achievements in the local and economic self-help area should also be in the remit for programming. I ask the Minister of State to consider this.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	183	The concerns on the Opposition side are that the Bill is backward rather than forward looking and these amendments are an attempt to rectify this. Amendment No. 10 aims to be in line with Government policy, as set out by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, in the recent Arts Act 2003. This sees no distinction between contemporary arts and traditional arts. Irish traditional music and other traditional arts are just as contemporary as any other form of music, such as rock. Once a differentiation is introduced between the two, one is killing the flow and innovation that is in traditional music and other arts. The amendment intends to bring a bit of modern Ireland back into the Bill, which, as Deputy Coveney says, is badly needed.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	184	The scope of the Bill, as set out in this section and in section 3, defines what the legislation is about. The categories of programmes are, and will remain, specifically focused on the subject of Irish culture, heritage and experience, and adult literacy. This is not an attempt to deny that there are many other interesting subjects for programming, but it is a more practical approach. Funding is limited and best focused on a specific category of programmes. Funding should not overlap with existing provisions, which already require broadcasters to prove a certain amount of news and current affairs programming. To extend the eligible categories would spread the scheme too thinly and dilute its effectiveness. As I have said, it should be possible to develop a variety of good quality programmes, which can fit within the objectives in the Bill, including programmes with a scientific or social theme.On Committee Stage, I said that some of the increase in the licence fee RTE received was to be allocated for an education and science correspondent, who has been appointed and is doing very good work. Having considered the proposal to remove the reference to traditional arts, I would still prefer to leave it in. While I agree that in one sense all living arts are contemporary in that they are practised and developing today, contemporary arts, as a category, is usually taken to be quite different from traditional arts. I particularly want to keep a focus on the traditional arts as an important example of Irish culture and heritage. While the Arts Act 2003 defines neither traditional nor contemporary art, it did find it necessary to define art as "any creative or interpretative expression whether traditional or contemporary".I feel the Bill adequately covers the areas mentioned by the Deputies and therefore I do not propose to accept the amendments.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I hope technological and scientific development will be covered by the present wording in these sections. There is some concern that the Bill appears somewhat backward looking. To address the need for a contemporary view, my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, wanted to remove the word "traditional". The Bill needs a greater emphasis on contemporary arts, science, and the social economy and the voluntary sector. I hope these are adequately treated in whatever schemes emerge as a result of this Bill. On that basis I will withdraw my amendment.

In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:"(c) the start-up costs of community broadcasters,”.On Committee Stage we had a lengthy discussion of the role of community broadcasting. In preparing to debate this Bill, as with other broadcasting legislation, we were contacted by the Community Media Network and various community radio stations. The Minister will agree that we have neglected community broadcasting in this country. While we have allocated licences we have not given sufficient support to broadcasters who carry out a not-for-profit community remit.In my area the leading community radio station is NEAR FM, North-East Access Radio, which covers the constituencies of Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East. Over the years that station has struggled with start-up costs, renting premises at a local community campus and subsequently has had difficulties in maintaining staff. There is a constant need to rely on community employment and jobs initiative schemes. This community radio station and others around the country have provided very valuable coverage of local events. They have been involved in a considerable amount of archiving of interviews with local citizens, including people from the north-side suburbs who lived there from a time when they were rural communities.Considerable valuable work has been done, particularly in the training of young broadcasters who emerged from broadcasting courses and then went on to commercial or public service stations. This fund could be used to support the development of community broadcasting. Recently there has been the development of community television and many community broadcasters are now moving into television broadcasting over limited areas. My amendment seeks to provide for part of the start-up costs from this fund.The Minister said this fund should only be used for programming. However, those in the community-broadcasting sector feel there is a need for funding. For years there should have been a link between community broadcasters and the national public service broadcaster, the national commercial broadcasters and a network of local stations. Community broadcasters could have been taken under the wings of these larger broadcasters to give them some assistance in the territory they cover. It was for this reason that I tabled amendment No. 19, which recommends that a specified percentage of funding be allocated to community broadcasters.My colleague, Senator O'Meara, also pressed for this amendment to be made when the Bill was taken in the Seanad. Legislation for this fund affords the first opportunity to allocate money to this very worthy cause. Some community stations have done very well in the past and have been very successful without finding themselves in the dire financial circumstances others have endured. This is an opportunity for the Minister to look at the funding of community broadcasting and, as a first step, to allocate part of this fund for that purpose.

I can understand the spirit of these amendments and agree that the community-broadcasting sector can provide valuable services for communities. As this legislation only deals with a small amount of funding, it is not envisaged that we would fund the setting up of community radio or television stations. This area is being considered as part of the Department's review of radio licensing.Community broadcasters can access the scheme for suitable programmes. As the focus of the scheme is on audiences and programmes, we cannot anticipate from where the best programmes will come. The Bill already allows the BCI to decide that funding in a particular year will be directed at particular classes of programmes or at programmes broadcast on a particular medium, such as radio or community television. The BCI will be able to direct funding to worthwhile programmes in the community radio and television sectors. Start-up, capital, training and other costs other than those relating to new programmes are outside the scope of this Bill.While I appreciate the spirit in which the amendments are tabled, I cannot accept them at this time. In the review of radio licensing we will be examining many areas, including the evolution of funding.

His colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, raised an interesting point in recent weeks when he said we had sold off valuable areas of our national spectrum. This was widely discussed in the media. When the sector is successful, elements are sold on for many millions of euro and the State has no come back. If the Minister is saying community broadcasting could serve as a means by which we could claw back funding, that might provide a basis to support community broadcasters. I would welcome that.Why will the Minister of State not agree to specifying a percentage of the fund to help meet the start-up costs of community broadcasters? Such a provision was also the subject of an amendment tabled in the Seanad. What is wrong with directing some percentage of the fund to community programmes?

It was never envisaged that moneys would be allocated to meet the start-up or capital costs of community television or radio.Deputy Broughan suggested a possible claw back. I would have no problem with that. I am sure it can be examined within our Department. Some of the funding could be ring-fenced to help community television and radio. While we have community radio in many parts of the country, community television is not widespread owing to the prohibitive start-up costs involved. It is important that the Minister and the Department should examine this issue and consider some of Deputy Broughan's suggestions.

In page 5, line 30, after "circumstances" to insert "and may in particular require that funding be allocated on a thematic basis during periods specified in the scheme".The Labour Party also tabled this amendment in the Seanad on the basis of submissions made to us. The amendment relates to concerns that few programmes will be made in respect of some of the desirable aims of the fund set out in section 2. Concerns have been expressed that proper programmes might not be made in respect of, among other aspects, the natural environment or folk, rural and vernacular heritage. It is feared the programmes in this area may represent a sop to the aims of the Bill and that funding will not be available to more ambitious projects to make series of programmes based on the themes outlined in section 2.The Minister of State has said he feels this fear is addressed, but concerns have been expressed to Senator O'Meara and me. We were told there was a need to make more specific provisions in this regard. I ask the Minister of State to look again at the amendment.

If amendments to a scheme are required, the Minister will wish to see the original scheme revoked and a new scheme put in its place. The Minister can, if necessary, direct the commission to take this action under section 2(6). As there will be no such thing as an amended scheme or an individual amendment which stands alone, it is not necessary to make Deputy Broughan's amendment. Therefore, I cannot accept it.

I thank the Minister of State for accepting the spirit of many of the amendments we brought forward on Committee Stage. On that basis, Fine Gael will not oppose the passage of the Bill. I have some reservations about the legislation, but its spirit and content is generally to be welcomed. My colleagues have some serious concerns about it. I thank the Minister of State and the Department for their efforts in this regard. We have not got everything we would have liked, especially in respect of subtitling and captioning, but the progress that has been made should be recognised.

I welcome the fact that he accepted a number of amendments. The Labour Party has a problem with the principle of the Bill.

The Bill that is about to be passed allows the Minister to interfere directly in funding decisions in respect of specific programming. It is a poor decision on the part of the Government. It is hypocritical that the Minister, who constantly says he wants to cease day-to-day interference, is assuming the power to amend or revoke detailed aspects of a scheme. I deeply regret that he has taken such a decision. It is a bad day for public sector broadcasting because we are facilitating close contact between politicians and the funding of programmes.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This is a short Bill on an important institution. The International Development Association, or IDA, is the World Bank's concessional lending window. It provides grants or long-term loans at zero interest rates to the poorest developing countries. The Bill will make provision for the payment of Ireland's share of the amount agreed at the IDA 13 replenishment discussions. Ireland pledged a contribution of €50 million payable over six years, subject to the approval of the Dáil. Today I seek that approval.In line with the IDA's principal mission to reduce poverty in the world's poorest countries, a country's per capita income must be below US$865 to be considered eligible for IDA assistance. Above that limit other sources of funding should be available. In Ireland, the initials IDA are better known for another public agency, also with important development functions, but Deputies will be interested to know that, across much of the developing world, the initials IDA mean the concessional loans and grants from this different specialised agency.The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or IBRD, which is better known as the World Bank, was established in 1944. It is one of the family of Bretton Woods institutions which were created for post-war economic and financial reconstruction. After the success of its first task, to rebuild a war-shattered Europe, the bank turned its attention to the developing countries, where there was deep and profound need for economic and social development.As the 1950s progressed and many countries, such as Ireland, achieved economic progress, often using borrowed funds to support industrial development, it became clear that the poorest developing countries could not afford to borrow the money they needed for development on the terms offered by the commercial banks or even the World Bank. They had very great needs but little ability to pay. They required access to money on easier terms.With the United States taking the initiative, a group of bank member countries decided to set up a new institution which could lend to very poor developing nations on highly concessional terms. They called that agency the International Development Association – IDA. The then US President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had seen both the devastation of Europe and the success of its post-war reconstruction, proposed that IDA should be part of the World Bank family of institutions and other countries agreed to this. The IDA's initial articles of agreement became effective in 1960.The first IDA loans were approved in 1961, to Honduras, India, Sudan and Chile. Since 1960, the IDA has lent more than $135 billion to the poorest states. Its founders saw the IDA as a way for the haves of the world to help the have-nots. Today, the IDA lends, on average, about $6 billion to $7 billion a year for different types of development projects, especially those that address peoples' basic needs, such as primary education, basic health services, clean water and sanitation. The IDA also funds projects which protect the environment, improve conditions for private business, build needed infrastructure, and support reforms aimed at liberalising countries' economies. All these projects pave the way towards economic growth, job creation, higher incomes and a better quality of life.A way for the better-off states of the world to assist the weaker ones remains the IDA mission today. However, the founders also wanted the IDA to be imbued with the discipline of a bank, not least so that borrowers would be able to adopt the discipline of working with other financial institutions. One challenge which is still with us today in addressing the great needs of IDA clients more effectively and efficiently is to develop suitable mechanisms to pool knowledge and harmonise requirements with the other multilateral institutions, within and without the Bretton Woods group of institutions, the bilateral development agencies, and the clients.Much of the effort of the IDA is concentrated in Africa, the site of some of the most intractable problems in the world at present. At current rates of population growth, sub-Saharan Africa will grow to more than one billion people by 2020, despite declining birth rates and the increasing number of deaths from AIDS. Both the IDA and the World Bank have had a huge impact on fighting the problem of HIV-AIDS, the greatest heath problem of our era. The World Bank and IDA are the largest investors in AIDS projects of any institutions in the world.The need for AIDS-related funding is continually expanding and is one of the reasons this Bill arises now. The HIV-AIDS pandemic has killed 23 million of the 63 million people it has infected to date and left 14 million orphans worldwide. It has left countries in Africa in particular without many of working age. It has killed care-givers and teachers. Africa faces continued loss of human capital and life with severe impacts on economic growth. In some countries, life expectancy has been cut by up to ten years due to the HIV-AIDS crisis. The IDA supports multisectoral efforts which aim to ensure co-ordination with other multilateral and bilateral donors in providing a platform for addressing the pandemic. Africa's development issues are complex and interwoven. The IDA continues to examine these issues systematically and seek ways to respond in a flexible and timely manner.Conflict has imposed a large cost on African countries, both in human and economic terms. Alongside efforts to address its key determinants of poverty, unemployment, and low education levels, the IDA has begun to examine how best to contribute to the reduction of conflict in the region. Ways to re-engage with and redeploy IDA resources to countries emerging from conflict are being actively pursued. In addition, IDA has stepped up its involvement in countries' efforts to improve governance and ensure greater political participation.While the mission of the International Development Association remains the provision of soft money to the poorest countries, there will always be need for periodic inflows of new money from those countries, including Ireland, which are prepared to inject capital into the IDA. This is a much smaller group of countries than the 184 countries that are in membership of the World Bank. The IDA is funded largely by contributions from the governments of the richer member countries. Their cumulative contributions since 1960 are about US$109 billion. More money is needed for the IDA every three years to replenish its funds. Funding for the 13th IDA replenishment will allow the association to lend about $23 billion, of which donors' contributions will provide a little more than half. The remaining funds come largely from reflows of previous IDA credits, as well as other non-donor resources.Periodic replenishment of IDA resources is inevitably the product of long and complex discussions, not only about the capital needs but on other issues such as the future operation of the institution. The agreement for the 13th replenishment of IDA includes two major changes to which I wish to refer: the conversion of loans to grants and the establishment of performance standards.Regarding this issue of loans vis-à-vis grants, in July of 2001 the USA proposed that the World Bank and other multilateral development banks replace up to 50% of future lending to the world's poorest countries with grants. This proposal was controversial with many IDA donors and some borrowing countries concerned that the loss of loan reflows would hurt the long-term viability of the IDA program.Without significant new commitments from certain major donors being in prospect in future replenishment discussions, future IDA activities might become difficult. In short the money going out through grants would not come back in through repayments and it might not come back through new donor commitments either. While the need for aid was never more necessary, obtaining international commitments from some non-EU states to support future IDA needs for resources will be likely to prove difficult.The need for funds for other aid projects, such as the reconstruction needs of Afghanistan or more recently Iraq, create competing calls for the scarce international resources being committed. Other donors fear the broader use of grants would create an unhealthy dependency on foreign aid and hinder the development of international creditworthiness.In July 2002, the IDA donors eventually and in some cases reluctantly agreed to a complex plan to convert 18% to 21% of future IDA loans to grants. Under this plan, IDA-only countries will receive 100% of their assistance for HIV-AIDS and natural disaster reconstruction projects on grant terms. Post-conflict and debt-vulnerable countries with a per capita income of less than $1 per day will receive 40% of their assistance on grant terms separate from and in addition to HIV-AIDS or natural disaster funds. All other countries with a per capita income of less than $1 per day will receive 23% of their assistance in the form of grants, again separate from and in addition to programmes to deal with HIV-AIDS and natural disasters. It is as yet too early to assess this change, which is only in its earliest stages.The introduction of a framework for measuring results was another innovation of the IDA 13 replenishment arrangement. The objective is to better assess the effectiveness of IDA programming in contributing to key development outcomes, including those reflected in the millennium development goals, MDGs, and in the growth agenda underpinning these goals. The IDA 13 arrangement called for the development of a system that reflects country priorities, links to the MDGs, and assesses the IDA's contribution to development results. The Irish have been generous in dealing with requests for measures to assist others less well off than ourselves in the past and I have no doubt that House will wish to follow that path today. I commend the Bill to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18533	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I support the introduction of the Bill to the House. It is a worthwhile programme but I wish to comment on the general context of development aid and this area itself.The Government has set itself a target of achieving a level of development aid of 0.7% of gross national production by 2007. While some progress was made between 2000 and 2003, it has been arrested this year. If the Government's target for 2007 is to be taken seriously, we are now well past the half time-mark to achieve it, yet we have only a quarter of the target movement achieved. Therefore, we still have to achieve three quarters of the Government's commitment to raise aid between 2000 and 2007. I am concerned that this year the apparent tightness in Government finances resulted in an end to the progress which had been evident in making greater commitments to development aid.If the Government is serious about its commitment, the Minister must make a firm strategy statement regarding how it plans to achieve its target for 2007. Some agencies in the field are concerned that the move in 2004 to stop in its tracks the slow progress that was being made means that the Government is rowing back from its commitment. It would be encouraging to hear the Minister of State indicate, on behalf of the Government, that the commitment remains firm. The agencies to which I refer could then rest assured that, in light of a multiannual framework, they could build on the basis of growing contributions from the State.There is clearly a case for making this contribution and for achieving the target the Taoiseach has set. However, Ireland has an important strategic role to play in terms of ensuring that other countries honour their commitments. Ireland will play such a role next year when it holds the EU Presidency and it is regarded, in view of its non-colonial past, as being an honest broker. I was disturbed by some of the material provided by the World Bank to the effect that there has been a collapse in the level of aid being given by other states to meet development needs in recent years. It appears that countries are rowing back on their commitments. It is important that Ireland not only reiterates its commitment and puts in place a strategic plan to achieve it, but also seeks to use its considerable international influence in respect of this matter.Ultimately, it is in everyone's interest that we build a more stable world with less poverty. Such stability must be built on everyone having a stake in the success of world economies and social development. There is clear evidence that, in the past two years, the sense of global determination to address poverty has fractured as other concerns, particularly those relating to terrorism, have entered the arena. While the issues are not linked, the Government needs to continue to focus the important strategy of addressing world poverty which was evident in the development of the millennium development goals but which appears to have lost its momentum since the heady days when those goals were set.Any contribution to the World Bank and the IMF, raises questions about the policies these agencies pursue in developing countries. I am out of touch with the sort of policies that are being pursued. However, some years ago I did some work in the former CIS countries and I was staggered by the simplistic formula the World Bank and the IMF seemed to apply to states which, in the instance to which I refer, were seeking to shake off the shackles of a communist regime. They had a simplistic and blind faith in neo-classical economics which, I accept, may well be geared towards countries with good infrastructures and institutional bases. However, running hard on issues such as privatisation, opting immediately for market-based pricing without having serious regard to the effects on the society involved, and pushing for capital market and free market liberalisation at a furious pace, was questionable. To a large degree the World Bank and the IMF were trying to apply thinking that had developed in a different climate to countries which needed to have their institutions evolve rather than, in a sort of crash, bang approach, having what existed previously destroyed and replaced with something entirely new.What we were faced with in the instance to which I refer were bright-eyed and bushy-tailed people trying to tell countries how to change. Suggestions from the IMF or the World Bank regarding what changes should be made carry quite a weight because, at the end of the day, these organisations write the cheques. A person I knew, Joe Steiglitz, came out at one stage with a trenchant criticism of the way the World Bank had put together its policies in many of these countries. From my limited experience, I understand the thrust of what he was saying about the simplistic, one size fits all approach that was adopted during the period in question.I hope the World Bank has made substantial moves away from its previous position. Looking at its website, I was encouraged to see that it appears to be adopting a more holistic approach to the societies it is trying to help to develop. It is important that the Minister, on behalf of the Government, take every opportunity to try to ensure that the policies pursued, while not tolerating some of the corrupt practices that are evident and institutionalised in some developing countries, including some of the former CIS states, must be sensitive towards the sort of structures that are capable of being redesigned and of continuing to work successfully. The pace of policy change must be judged in a way that is coherent and does not create excessive pressure on the weakest, which has all too often been the case, in the societies to which I refer.Many people are concerned about the success of the initiative for highly-indebted countries. There is a fear that this initiative, while welcome, has focused too much on a bankers' interest approach to debt problems and has not concentrated sufficiently on the needs of countries. I am interested in whether the Minister of State believes there is scope for tilting the emphasis within the HIPC initiative away from the traditional bankers' approach and towards a more developmental approach. The Minister of State referred to the US initiative of trying to move more substantially towards grant aid rather than debt aid. Perhaps a similar shift in emphasis could be applied in respect of the highly-indebted countries.I read a report on the IMF website entitled the Impact of Debt Reduction under the HIPC Initiative on External Debt Service and Social Expenditures. The report records that there were significant reductions, approximately 30%, in debt service for some of the most indebted countries. One of the overall targets was to increase social spending as a result of the restructuring and this was secured in the case of Latin American countries which are at the upper end of the scale in terms of countries in severe difficulties. As far as African countries are concerned, however, spending on social programmes remained doggedly at just 5% of GDP and unchanged in the years when this programme of debt reduction was applied. This suggests that the programme is probably doing more good for those who are at the upper end of the scale and lifting those which are able to lift themselves, while leaving the countries with the greatest difficulties to struggle.It is alarming that these states devote just 5% of GDP to cover all social programmes. We would criticise the Government if it spent only 8% in the area of health. That is not to mention what is spent on education, housing and the various other areas. The countries to which I refer have tiny GDPs and the squeeze on social spending in their jurisdictions is clear, despite the impact of the HIPC programme. As it continues to commit to its development aid targets, I hope the Government will be able to exercise influence on the policies to which I refer and ensure that they are replaced with more inspired policies.By and large, I welcome the introduction of the Bill. It is important that Ireland should continue to support this initiative. The IDA is a significant player in many of the most worthwhile programmes and I am sure it is a useful influence in terms of the way policy is developed. I hope Ireland will use its voice in these agencies to promote a more positive developmental approach in this area than has been sadly evident in recent years.It is alarming that the HIPC initiative, which was supposed to be one of the leading edge initiatives introduced for disadvantaged countries, is now spending less than it did in 1995. This agency is receiving a bigger share of the cake than heretofore, yet it is spending less than it did in 1995. The evidence suggests we are moving too slowly, some would say we are going backwards, and that the need for momentum has never been greater.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I welcome the brief discussion on this Bill and call for a degree of accountability and transparency from the Department of Finance, particularly the Minister for Finance, on Ireland's participation in the Bretton Woods institutions, in the context not just of our domestic role as regards Ireland's interest in them but in terms of our role in its development policies.There has been ongoing criticism of the Industrial Development Association and other international monetary institutions in regard to developing countries. While the World Bank has undergone a degree of reform that is not only overdue but welcome, it has a long way to go. While a number of UN agencies to which Ireland, in the context of a rising aid budget, is now a significant contributor have undergone a level of reform, they have a long way to go in terms of the tide of human misery which besets the developing world and in terms of the unfairness in trade and the international framework which bedevils the developing world.There has been all-party consensus on growing the Irish aid budget. Nonetheless, there is no room for complacency on our part in terms of the programmes we support and the effectiveness of our actions in regard to those programmes. When in Cancun, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and various members of the Irish Government solemnly reaffirmed Ireland's commitment to reaching the 0.7% goal for the development aid budget by 2007. It might be helpful if everybody now acknowledged that this particular target, in terms of budget 2004 and the Estimates, has in effect been abandoned by this Government.There has been a clever public relations focus on our commitment to development. While the budget, in absolute terms, is rising, the Estimates show we are at a standstill in 2003-2004 in terms of our commitment to development. That is reality. The year-on-year increases are, however, important and welcome. It is equally important that they are well spent.I have spoken before of my reservations about Ireland simply signing blank cheques for UN agencies and, in this case, for the IDA and the Bretton Woods institutions. I do not think the poorest people in the world, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, are well served by the hands-off approach the Minister for Finance has chosen to take to the Bretton Woods institutions in respect of Ireland's contribution to IDA, HIPC and other initiatives.Good arguments have been made – Deputy Bruton referred to some of them – that our decision to sign up to HIPC was a bad one. Subsequent events have borne out the position I and others took that HIPC lacked ease of access for the poorest countries in the world and was subject to conditions they could not meet. Those who framed the initiative knew that, hence the understanding referred to by Deputy Bruton.It is a shame that, in terms of political cant and hypocrisy, the poorest people and the poorest Governments on the globe should have vast pots of money trailed under their noses by this and other Bills when, in fact, much of that money will never be drawn down on a timely basis when it is most needed. That is reality. All the grand global conferences will not make a difference to the female children who will never attend school, to the villages that will never get water and the patients who will never be treated for AIDS. For instance, we cannot deliver on relatively simple objectives such as treating expectant mothers with drugs that would prevent the onward transmission of the virus to their babies. The number of such programmes is lamentably small compared to the needs which exist in sub-Saharan Africa.I salute former Presidents Carter and Clinton who, in their retirement, have tried to highlight this issue. It is an absolute shame and a disgrace that we are signing up to another large tranche of money while real delivery, in terms of needs on the ground in Africa, is pitifully small.There are a number of issues which the Irish Government needs to flag. The Minister has not yet told this House the outcome of the discussions in Cancun on the poorest farmers in the world and their access to markets. We have never properly debated the outcome of those discussions.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The Minister of State needs to listen to what I have to say. These are issues of life and death for many on this planet. I do not accept that what the Government is doing is sufficiently accountable or sufficiently transparent.Ireland will take up the Presidency of the European Union in January and may take on responsibilities in regard to the EU constitution. Up to now development issues have had an integrity in the European Union and have not simply been subsumed in wider foreign policy and military concerns. In the ongoing constitutional discussions the role and integrity of development aid, genuinely assisting poverty reduction in the poorest countries in the world, should not play second fiddle to a wider militarised European Union agenda. That important issue cuts across the debate on neutrality. It relates to the integrity of our and the European Union's approach to development issues, which should not be specifically linked, as some from a right wing agenda in Europe are suggesting, to wider issues of European Union political, diplomatic and, above all, military considerations. What will Ireland do, during its Presidency of the EU, in that regard?I also want to address the reforms in the World Bank, with particular reference to poverty reduction and support credit, so-called PRSPs. I draw the attention of the House to a number of Irish NGOs, particularly Trócaire, Concern and the Debt and Development Coalition Ireland, that have, along with the Harvard-based Bretton Woods project, analysed the effect of these new strategies. Deputy Richard Bruton referred to his experience in the CIS. I worked in Tanzania for three years in the 1980s and had the privilege to be there when men with briefcases arrived from the IMF. What did this mean for the structural adjustment programme? The school, health and water budgets were savaged as the men from the ministry cut the things that make a country function for ordinary people.I am sorry the Minister for Finance is not here as we have discussed this matter on a number of occasions. In his lovely right wing way, he seems to think that a little bit of toughness can sometimes be good for people. He seems to think that if one is brought up with no education and no access to medicine or fresh water, it will make one a stronger person. That is rubbish. If someone in Ireland has an expectation of access to education, clothing, medicine, shelter and clean water as being among the basic norms by which we describe a functioning economy that looks after and gives life opportunity to most of our people, why should we adopt different criteria when it comes to sub-Saharan Africa?Most of the bank's new programmes have been put in place in Uganda. While an intense critique of Uganda and its Government is ongoing in Ireland, particularly regarding what has happened in the Congo, I do not want to talk about this at this time. The Ugandan Government gets five stars in all IMF evaluations regarding its efforts at poverty reduction and the bank has used Uganda as a model for its poverty reduction and support credit schemes, but I am disappointed at how much real difference it has made to poverty reduction on the ground.Garret FitzGerald established the Irish aid programme 30 years ago. A succession of Ministers of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, including Deputies O'Donnell, Kitt and I, have, in a non-partisan way, sought to make the Irish programme effective. I am deeply disappointed that the Department of Finance has failed to bring Ireland's critical voice and contribution to some of the bank's programmes and point out what they are doing in countries like Uganda. These programmes are now dressed up as reform programmes that offer poverty reduction strategies. For example, the bank has sought to address the water issue. However, it comes with ideological thinking that could have come straight from the Chicago School of Economics. The water system in Uganda is to be privatised and people will have to pay water charges.Disastrous structural adjustment programmes have taken place in Uganda. Schools were closed all over the country and girls, in particular, were removed from education. In a family with six or seven children, the boys will be sent to school. To its credit, the Ugandan Government has reinstated large elements of relatively free or cheap access to primary education. It has been one of the big successes in recent years. When clean water schemes are put in place, why does the bank, with its stupid right wing frame of mind, insist that the network should be privatised? It does not make sense.I also want to draw attention to the bank's cost structures. Devesh Kapoor, who works in Harvard, is seeking to reform the bank through the Bretton Woods project. The bank's administrative budget is approximately $1.2 billion, which also covers countries other than developing ones. Client services account for less than half the overall budget while expenditure on the corporate secretariat amounts to more than two-thirds of what goes on lending. The rest reflects majority shareholder driven mandates, either directly or through the so-called stakeholders. The bank is spending much of its money on corporate structures and overheads, and having its western experts travel around the globe. The bank's strategy at local level on poverty reduction means that NGOs and local groups are to be the driving force evaluating what a government in a Third World or sub-Saharan African country does. However, the expenditure of resources is concentrated on headquarters. I do not know that Ireland can stand over signing blank cheques for such administration. The same also applies to the cheques we are giving many UN agencies. In many cases, bank structures and UN agencies are the only way of delivering certain types of benefits to countries. Nonetheless, we must retain a critical voice as to how this money is spent; every dollar spent on headquarters is a dollar taken from the world's poorest people. We are entitled to get an answer from the Department of Finance as to how it evaluates and keeps watch on what the bank spends on administration vis-à-vis developing countries.I now turn to local structures. These are correctly supposed to be critically important to poverty reduction. When one goes into a clinic or school in Tanzania, Malawi or Uganda, one is supposed to be able to examine its budget for the year. One is supposed to be able to ask the director or principal how he or she is spending the money. What resourcing is given to those local groups? What status have they been given? The bank is happy to cloak itself in local participation. However, as with partnership structures in Ireland, cloaking itself in local participation means that such structures must be supported. Whether the local university is carrying out more critical and technical evaluations or this is being done by local community structures, they must be supported. In most parts of the Third World, people have to work hard to make a basic living for themselves and their families. If they are not assisted in this evaluation, it simply amounts to window dressing adopting the language of popular participation and community evaluation without having any substance to it.When I worked in the university in Dar es Salaam, the men from the bank – they always were men in those days – suggested that the university could cut its student numbers by a certain percentage. We know the formula in Ireland for social welfare cuts. Anger over the 16 social welfare cuts is high among social welfare recipients. How much higher is it among the poorest of the poor in developing countries and those servicing the front-line institutions, primary schools, clinics and hospitals?When we debate this issue next year, I would like the Minister for Finance and his officials to state perhaps five areas that were targeted for strategic improvement as a result of Irish participation in the preceding year. The first might include the resourcing of the local evaluation and participation process in drawing up plans. This should be made a reality and not just a matter of public relations. A second area that should be targeted and reviewed severely is that of headquarters' costs of the banks and institutions. As I said, a dollar spent in headquarters is a dollar taken from the poorest countries.The United States has a strategic veto and is engaged in a series of military initiatives which I hope will not last long and which I hope are an aberration in the country's history. They have incredible consequences for those in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries. The US is effectively vetoing positive reform of poverty reduction on the ground.Let me give some examples of people speaking with forked tongues. What is one supposed to do in respect of poverty reduction? One is supposed to reduce military expenditure. However, given its strategic military overview, the United States is very anxious that particular allies spend money on military items. Expenditure on military hardware by Pakistan is high, yet it has an unfortunately high number of people with no literacy capacity whatsoever, particularly women. These are tricky issues for the Department of Finance to raise, but it is important that it does so.The fourth area where targeting is necessary concerns our upcoming EU Presidency. In the ongoing discussions on the new EU constitution, there is a view that the development budget of the European Union should become more geared towards its diplomatic, political and military aims. Until now, the issue of development co-operation has occupied in the Union a space of relative integrity, free from direct political, diplomatic and military considerations. During the Presidency, the Government should encourage a discussion on the role of development moneys within the Union and ascertain how we can ensure the EU constitution will remain focused on poverty reduction and capacity building in some of the poorest countries in the world. If we manage to do so, it may, in the longer and shorter terms, be the best way to enhance the diplomatic and political aims of the Union. If we focus our development assistance co-operation programmes on democratic reform, access to social capital in education, housing, clean water and basic primary health care, this in turn will enhance enormously the prestige of the Union.Deputy Michael D. Higgins stated that, in the context of the conflict in the Middle East, the long-term EU focus on assisting the development of a properly resourced Palestinian state remains a very important contribution to the peace process in the region. Unfortunately, the US Government has not enhanced this process.This debate presents an opportunity to reflect on what the Government has been doing regarding development. Our overall development programmes are, for the most part, good. More imagination could be used in developing new programmes and expanding existing ones. Our voice could be heard at a much more serious and sustained level in respect of development policies. The recent DAC report on Irish aid awarded very high marks for poverty reduction programmes, etc. However, as we are now allocating much more money to Irish NGOs, UN agencies and banks, we lack sufficient mechanisms to monitor what those bodies do with it. For the most part, Irish NGOs, with which I still work very closely, have an excellent record, but everybody benefits from continuous evaluation and feedback on how well his objectives are realised.

It is also about sharing wealth and moving towards equality, justice and true democratic principles. Above all, it is about doing something practical and positive for poorer states.I welcome this debate, which gives us all a chance to deal with poverty and injustice throughout the world and to speak up for the countries that are not being served well by the more wealthy states. Wealthy states have a duty and responsibility to assist poorer countries. Ireland has a long and interesting record in terms of international humanitarian famine relief and peacekeeping. Those who say Ireland sits on the fence or that it is squeamish on foreign policy issues should be told to put up or shut up. I refer in particular to the recent statement by Commissioner Byrne, which was disgraceful and showed a complete lack of understanding of the Irish view at an international and humanitarian level. There is nothing squeamish about putting our soldiers' lives on the line in Liberia or, in the past, the Lebanon. There is nothing squeamish about our efforts to assist Third World countries or about trying to assist and develop the peace process in the Middle East.It is important that we examine the important details in the legislation and the role of the Industrial Development Association in general. The Bill is designed to enable the Government to make a total payment of €50 million to the 13th replenishment of the association. As on previous occasions, the Bill amends the International Development Association Acts 1960 to 1999 to allow payments to be made to the IDA. As many are aware, the IDA is the soft loan arm of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, or the World Bank, which was established in 1960. The IDA provides highly concessionary financial resources to low-income countries to help them reduce poverty and achieve faster, more environmentally sustainable, broad-based growth. It is the single largest source of concessionary financial assistance to the world's poorest countries. In the fiscal year 2002, IDA assistance was provided to countries that have a per capita income of less than $875 per annum.The IDA helps the world's poorest countries reduce poverty by providing "credits" which are loans at zero interest with a ten-year grace period and maturities of 35 to 40 years. These countries face complex challenges in striving for progress toward the millennium development goals set out and agreed at the Monterey Conference on Financing for Development of March 2002. For example, they must respond to the competitive pressures as well as the opportunities of globalisation, they must arrest the spread of HIV/AIDS and they must provide clean water and basic education. They must often deal with conflict and its aftermath.Investment in public services is also required when dealing with poverty in Third World countries. Recent research clearly illustrates that countries with high levels of social expenditure have low levels of poverty. This requires investment in health, education, housing and child care services, as well as in income support. While Ireland has increased its level of social expenditure we need to look at ourselves and the international community to continue to ensure that historical deficits are made up. As a society and international community we also need to decide whether we want a two-tier system, where those who can afford services get them and those who cannot do not, or whether we wish to build a society or international community based on quality services for all to which we are all prepared to contribute. A strong social system can complement and support economic growth, which is crucial to this debate. It does not need to be an either/or situation. Active policies and investment in people, particularly at an early age, are key and I encourage Ireland to push this agenda internationally.Many of these issues were debated at recent European Union meetings to discuss national action plans against poverty and social exclusion submitted by member states to the European Commission. Six key priorities have been identified across the plans: increasing active labour market measures; ensuring minimum income schemes are adequate; increasing access of the most vulnerable people to housing, health, education and culture; reducing early school leaving; ending child poverty; and reducing poverty among immigrants and ethnic minorities. A key issue for most states is the need to allocate resources to ensure the implementation of the plans, especially in the more difficult economic conditions in Europe. As we look forward to hosting the EU Presidency in the first six months of 2004, I hope these issues will receive greater attention and debate at both Irish and European levels.Section 1 of the Bill amends section 3 of the International Development Association Act 1960, as amended by subsequent legislation, by the insertion of new subsections (2)(o) and (p) which provide for the contribution to the 13th replenishment of a sum not exceeding €50,000,000. Section 2 of the Bill contains the short title and collective citation.The IDA is among the key multilateral institutions involved in this task and is specifically charged with responsibility for poverty reduction and the promotion of growth and development. Today nearly 3 billion people live on less than $2 a day and 1.1 billion people on less than $1 a day. The mission of the Minister of State and the IDA is to support efficient and effective programmes to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in its poorest member countries. The IDA helps build the human capital, policies, institutions and physical infrastructure needed to bring about equitable and sustainable growth. Its goal is to reduce the disparities across and within countries, to bring more people into the economic mainstream, and to promote equitable access to the benefits of development. These are the core issues in the legislation, which I strongly welcome.When dealing with the IDA and poverty in general, we cannot walk away from the issues of war, justice, hatred, oppression and racism. Let us remind ourselves of what Nelson Mandela said in 1994 when he was made President of South Africa. He stated:No-one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate and if they can learn to hate they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.That message is very relevant to today's debate. It is relevant to the Holy Cross school in Belfast, the West Bank, Liberia, Chechnya, Afghanistan and Iraq. In the last few days American forces in Iraq admitted their fighter jets killed six more children in an attack on a compound used by a so-called militant near Gardez in Paktia province. This is in addition to the nine children killed by American fighter jets on Saturday. Children are obviously becoming legitimate targets in many conflicts, which is unacceptable.As opposition grows in Iraq, more and more people are asking if it is the new Vietnam, and some of the facts support that view. The attrition rate among US forces in Iraq, the percentage of soldiers killed or wounded, is 9.25%, which is already higher than the level in Vietnam. Of course there were many more US troops in Vietnam at the peak of the war than there are in Iraq, but it took three years, from 1962 to 1965, for the death toll to reach the level it has already reached in Iraq. There are only 30,000 soldiers on the front line in Iraq and it is clear they face a high risk of becoming casualties. No wonder, then, that 14 soldiers recently committed suicide and dozens of others have maimed themselves to avoid active service.

There should also be sensible community policing by gardaí, given recent incidents at Shannon Airport.I said that when discussing international poverty and disadvantage one must include the race issue, which is part of the international problem. I have some sensible proposals to deal with the rise of racism both in Irish society and internationally. We must face up to the reality that immigration in Ireland, and across the world, is a permanent reality and one which will enhance our nation. We must also accept that cultural and ethnic diversity should be respected and supported. Immigrants and their communities, in Ireland or elsewhere, should be empowered to improve their quality of life and Ireland should comply with international laws, obligations and undertakings on immigration, and legislation should always be humane and just. These are the values I want to put forward. On the international level I would like more radical reform of policies assisting Third World countries. I welcome this debate on the IDA.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	226	Members, including myself, have tabled a number of parliamentary questions over the past year querying how the Minister for Finance interacts with the World Bank and its sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund, on development issues. The Minister has studiously avoided answering the questions and, when specific scenarios have been pointed out, he has not availed of the opportunity to contribute to the debate on these issues. Earlier this year, the annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF was held in Washington. The Minister attended the meeting but he did not take the opportunity to raise development issues.This issue is at the nub of the legislation because, while the International Development Association engages in work endorsed by every Member, it is an arm of the World Bank. Many people dealing with development issues recognise that the World Bank throughout its history has been as much a part of the problem as it has been part of the solution. The bank has been reformed and we all hope the ongoing debate about the bank will result in better reforms. However, in terms of its ethos, organisation and effect, the bank has, in many cases, damaged developing countries.We must analyse how taxpayers' money can be used to the maximum effect. Ireland must willingly endorse one principle as a prosperous nation, which is to distribute its prosperity in a fair way in a world that is unfair. The International Development Association provides grant assistance to countries that have a per capita income of less than $875 annually, which equates to $2.50 a day or €2 a day. A total of 2 billion people live on less than $2 a day. The association assists a large number of our fellow inhabitants on the planet. At the end of the day, an allocation of €50 million by a country such as Ireland is small beer. It is three times the cost of the Punchestown racecourse development. That is why I am sorry the Minister for Finance has chosen not to take part in the debate and I hope he avidly reads the Official Report. He does not believe this area is a serious element of his brief.The International Development Association has addressed the scourge of HIV-AIDS in many countries that benefit from the soft loans it provides, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa. World AIDS Day has been held on 1 December for a number of years. The most recent figures regarding the number of people affected by AIDS were announced last week and 30 million are affected in sub-Saharan Africa. While Ireland's contribution is significant, it only amounts to €1.80 per person for that group.This is a short Bill which updates the legislation that enabled Ireland's accession to the association in 1960 and provides for the allocation of €50 million. However, it must be examined in the context of Ireland's commitment to overseas development assistance which the Taoiseach has stated should reach 0.7% of gross national product by 2007. The allocation in the Book of Estimates equates to 0.41% of GNP. The Government needs to more than double its existing allocation in overseas development aid to achieve its target. It would need to increase the allocation by approximately €180 million per year in the intervening years. However, the Government's commitment is not being supported with resources.I acknowledge that, by allocating 0.41% of GNP, Ireland remains one of the larger donor nations, but other countries have achieved an allocation of 0.7% of GNP. Given Ireland's prosperity, it should aspire to achieve that target. The scale of poverty in developing countries needs to emphasised. Ireland does not experience poverty on the scale of the countries it seeks to help through this allocation. While Ireland, as a prosperous nation, has a responsibility towards developing countries, the Government often gets the balance wrong in terms of distributing wealth domestically.The Minister of State referred to the competition for resources in the area of development aid because of circumstances in Afghanistan and Iraq. If this is Government policy, then the situation is much more serious that we thought. Development aid must be based on the principles outlined by Deputy Burton such as access to common resources, including water, food and shelter, and it should not be linked to geopolitical issues that have caused the conflicts in such countries. If the Government's policy is to frame its development aid programme by taking cognisance of the resource needs of conflict countries, which are determined by the states which caused the conflicts, we have significant problems.Everybody accepts the general principle behind the association and the allocation provided in the legislation. It is unfortunate the Government is not being more proactive in the debate and I fear this might be seen as an indicator of the its commitment towards achieving the target for overseas development aid of 0.7% of GNP. I hope I will be proved wrong on this because the public believes this commitment can, should and, in terms of moral responsibility, must be honoured. I hope the Government lives up to that responsibility.

The Bill facilitates a Government payment of €50 million to the International Development Association, an arm of the World Bank. There are significant problems about the way in which the World Bank and, more particularly, the International Monetary Fund operate. These include the piling of debt on heavily indebted countries and the tying of loans to a strict monetarist model of economic management, to privatisation and the exploitation of these countries by multinational corporations, thus worsening poverty and debt. It is a continuous cycle.Fundamental reform of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund is needed. Voting rights need to be amended to increase the voting strength of the developing world. Europe is over-represented and European representation must be reduced in favour of more equal regional representation. The South African finance Minister Trevor Manuel has proposed the establishment of an independent expert committee to study the issue and initiate reforms. During its EU Presidency the Government should back the Manuel proposal. I and other Deputies urge it to take up that proposal during its six month opportunity.There are two ways through which the Government can address world poverty: Irish overseas development assistance and the forthcoming EU Presidency. Overseas development assistance is an investment in global social justice, especially in the area of human rights – yesterday was International Human Rights day. It is money well spent.The Government has pledged to increase ODA spending to the United Nations target of 0.7% of gross national product by 2007. Given that this is now the fourth wealthiest state in the world according to statistics, we can well afford it. Many of our European neighbours do better. Five have already reached and exceeded the UN target. Luxembourg and Norway have committed to increasing their spend to 1% of GNP by 2005 and Sweden has committed to reaching 1% by 2006.What is our record? Not only did the Government fail to increase ODA to 0.48% of GNP for 2003, despite a prior agreement between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance, it clawed back on the 0.45% ODA spend originally promised for 2002. In the budget for 2003, the Government compounded this disappointment with its failure to ring-fence ODA and make a multi-annual commitment to progressive incremental annual increases to the target date of 2007, and with its effective freezing of 2003 ODA spending at the 2002 level of 0.41%. The Government now proposes to freeze ODA spending in 2004 at a level of 0.41% of GNP for the third year running. This is a depressing record.Development Co-operation Ireland and Dóchas have recommended managed ODA spending growth in the form of an incremental increase each year until the target is reached. Other Deputies outlined the details but I will repeat them. The targets now are 0.48% in 2004, 0.5% in 2005, 0.62% in 2006, and 0.7% in 2007. Sinn Féin endorses this approach.During its EU Presidency in 2004, the Government has extra responsibility to meet this commitment. It would set an example by so doing. Surely the example of the past three years is not the one we want to present to other member states or to an expanding European Union. The Government must show leadership to those EU and other states which have yet to meet the UN ODA target, by committing to ring-fence the ODA spend and to making annual incremental increases to 2007, beginning with a minimum spending increase to 0.48% of GNP for 2004.There are other issues of global social justice which the Irish EU Presidency should prioritise. I propose to put four issues to the Minister which I hope he will note. First, the Government should commit to bringing the EU partners on board to match Ireland's 2002 commitment to developing country debt cancellation with the urgent priority being debt cancellation for countries with high HIV-AIDS prevalence. It should facilitate a joint approach of EU member states which, like Ireland, are members of the international financial institutions to achieve reform and progress on debt cancellation. This is an important issue.Earlier this year on behalf of Sinn Féin I signed an open petition outside the Central Bank, as did other party representatives, which called for this step to be taken. Representatives of political parties in this Chamber signed that petition and each of us must follow through on our written commitment with action.Second, the Government should work towards reform of the international financial system and to strengthen the voice of developing countries in international economic decision-making. With the collapse of the World Trade Organisation round in Cancun, the Presidency programme must prioritise trade justice. It must commit to supporting creation of a multilateral binding code of conduct for EU participation in trade negotiations.Third, the Irish Presidency must ensure that poverty eradication is a guiding principle for EU external action and ensure policy coherence in this regard. It should propose the establishment of a permanent EU monitoring group to review members' implementation of Monterey and Barcelona commitments which include aid increases, aid harmonisation and the untying of aid.Fourth, not for the first nor probably the last time, I avail of this opportunity to make the case for the Tobin tax. The Irish Presidency programme should show global leadership by committing to the introduction of legislation establishing a Tobin tax in the State and campaigning to establish the EU as a Tobin tax area. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has to date ruled out the introduction of a Tobin tax but France—

He should note that France has introduced this tax and it can be done where the political will exists. The Minister's answer on this issue requires more than the cynicism and lack of interest shown to date. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to use his office to shed light on the important steps which must be taken.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Ireland's contribution to international development aid is welcome. No matter what contribution is made, it is never sufficiently large. However, it does us no harm to assess the magnitude of the situation to which Ireland should address itself. The aid situation is growing increasingly urgent, especially in Africa where warfare, starvation, drought, HIV and AIDS are a serious challenge for international development agencies.This is a good time to focus on Ireland's contribution as a small country. Our bilateral aid programme is well focused, in general, as also is our multilateral aid programme. However, as some development agencies have suggested, we should do our utmost to ensure that development aid goes in the direction for which it is intended. Failure in this regard only bolsters bureaucratic or corrupt governments, agencies or groups and helps them remain in power, thereby causing the type of devastation which the international aid programme is intended to address. Considerable strides have been made in connection with the HIV-AIDS situation in Uganda and much useful work has been done. A positive outcome in the region is that it has given some indication of what can be done when the various agencies concerned, including those in Uganda, address the issues and decide to take action on them.We need to be mindful of the vast size of the African continent, as this gives a perspective on the magnitude of the task which lies ahead. Other speakers referred to the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and various other agencies which have played a role in this area in the past, perhaps not always with the intention of achieving what we would see as the objectives of the International Development Association. However, in making its contribution, whether through the Departments of Finance or Foreign Affairs or at whatever level, the Irish Government has a duty and responsibility to seek to influence in a positive manner the direction and policy aspects of assistance which may be given.The Government can also encourage other contributing countries to follow suit by using its influence to promote a more equitable situation for victims and those in need of aid who await an outcome without being in control of the agencies through which aid is directed towards them. We should ensure that we can at least influence the manner in which aid is distributed as well as the extent and quality of aid delivered. Continuous assessment of progress is required. In the absence of such assessment, the tendency may be to allow existing programmes to continue without interruption, thus resulting in the same mistakes being made that were made in the past. Action on this is important.I compliment the bilateral aid programme in particular through which Irish agencies have involved themselves directly, adopting, as it were, their opposite numbers in the countries concerned. Lesotho, where an appraisal is taking place this week, is a good example in this regard. During an election monitoring mission in the country, I took the opportunity to visit the various Irish agencies which operate there in a responsible manner through taking on board local conditions and leading the way in guiding the local population in tackling problems. This development has continued under various Irish Governments over many years and augurs well for the bilateral aid programme. It is open to inspection, and this has been encouraged by Governments over the years. That is as it should be.I refer again to the health issue in Africa. I acknowledge the Minister's comments on the size of the African population and its likely increase to one billion by 2020. At this stage, a serious question must be asked, having regard to the progress to date, as to whether we are likely to achieve the result which is desirable and necessary to address and control the HIV-AIDS issue effectively. If this does not happen, the problem will drag on. The year 2020 is still quite far ahead. We must resolve the problem far sooner than that. Otherwise it will simply be replicated.While everybody may not necessarily agree with the views of John O'Shea of GOAL and the Government has on occasion strongly refuted some of the matters he has brought to our attention, nonetheless, what he has brought to our attention is important. It is essential that international aid, whether through the International Development Association or other channels, should be clearly seen to go directly to those for whom it is intended. Most importantly, the benefit must not go to intermediate or superior agents or agencies, bureaucrats or others who would seek to cream it off. The aid must go directly to those for whom it is intended to alleviate their problems. First, this will give hope to those concerned and, second, it will achieve progress.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. I have often spoken on IDA Bills as they have come before the House. Usually, they have tended to be nodded through as if there was not much scope for disagreement on them. While few Members of the House would usually wish to vote against such Bills, they raise important issues, some of which have been referred to by previous speakers. In the short time available to me, I will refer to a number of issues which I consider important.In the first instance, we have long passed the point where the Minister for Finance did not present an annual report on what happened in our name in the international financial institutions. As I understand the situation, we have not debated such reports in the House, although one has had sight of them at a distance. While acknowledging this, my party and, I imagine, other parties would be amenable to facilitating a detailed debate on this issue.I attended the previous meeting in Athens of the so-called parliamentary forum associated with the World Bank. I understand the next meeting will take place in the spring. At the previous meeting, there was a presentation by the head of the World Bank, Mr. Wilkinson. His speech, which I had heard previously, seemed open and reform minded. We also had an address from Mr. Kruger of the International Monetary Fund whose speech was appallingly poor in terms of economics, richness and backward ideological position. Among the parliamentarians present in Athens, there was a view that we would spend our time a great deal better by dealing with the achievement of the millennium goals agreed at the UN summit on development financing in Monterey. Those have been referred to earlier in the debate.  Dealing with the millennium goals would be disturbing for the World Bank, but we should speak plainly. We should have an opportunity to discuss in the House what is said in our name. I will come to this point shortly.With regard to the World Bank presentation in Athens, while I have not read the report of the Minister for Finance, I would like to know precisely where he stands on what was being sought in the context of the new instrument for global facility. I have not had an opportunity of reviewing this and I would welcome the opportunity.Few Irish people seem to advert to the fact that the institutions which we now criticise and against which there are many street protesters were originally United Nations sourced. The World Bank – originally a development bank – was responsible to the economic and social committee of the United Nations, through which it reported to the UN Secretary General It was a UN institution which spun away into a total lack of accountability and, very often, confrontation with some of the poorest people it should support. In the same way, the IMF has an interesting history and there is the particular history of the International Development Association to which the Minister of State helpfully referred in his speech.Where does the Government stand on the Washington consensus that leans on the policies and publications of development economics from the development institutions? There is a current debate going on among young African economists and those involved in the new partnership for development in southern Africa on a matter that we in Ireland spoke on in the 1950s and 1960s, namely, the right to choose our own path to development. Behind these institutional bodies' policies, there is an absolute refusal to acknowledge that there are different paths to development and alternatives to the neo-liberal, market and export-led economic models which are being imposed on poor countries.The Department of Finance has always intrigued me by the manner in which it rushes to quote figures from the OECD. OECD economic research is regularly wrong, based on poor databases and does not enjoy enormous respect among serious-minded economic theorists. On the other hand, the most qualified, internationally refereed published work comes from the UN Commissions for Africa and Latin America. The UN Commission for Europe has published the best studies on the energy requirements of Europe and the transitions in the Russian economy. However, its work is never quoted by the Department for the simple reason that the academics who write the reports are genuinely independent economists who are able to evaluate the consequences of one model rather than another. What the Department of Finance relies on is tarted-up flimsy journalism that comes occasionally from OECD reports, while neglecting serious economic work from the UN commissions. I have not seen UN commission work referred to in any speech by the Minister for Finance in the last ten years.This Bill is aimed at assisting countries that have an annual net income of less than $875 per head. Why is health and education expenditure not ring-fenced and the calculation of the relationship in terms of debt taken into account? For every country in Africa, where debt payments are exceeding the combined health and education expenditure, every 1% of GDP given to health and education as opposed to debt, can save the lives of 21,000 children. People regularly want to be shocked by, say, famine, into paroxysms of reaction. Why do we need one famine to succeed another? Why do we need hundreds of thousands of malnourished children to die after we have seen it all before? The blunt answer is the economic model cannot be tested.It was easier in the Middle Ages to question a natural law theory than it is to question the Washington consensus today. It is being purveyed by bureaucrats who simply ignore Nobel Prize winning economists, such as Amartya Sen. Questioning the model is not allowed. However, I want the model to be debated in the House instead of the farcical discussions held at the Committee on Foreign Affairs in which aid, trade and debt are discussed separate from each other.Global aid has been falling consistently. For every dollar of aid that goes to developing countries, $2.25 is returned by the African countries in unfair trade. Aid has fallen by a third since 1994 and halved since 1990. If one runs the population figures of the most vulnerable and at risk countries, alongside the fall in aid, one realises that so many millions more people have been put at risk. A Minister for Finance, irrespective of what party he or she might come from, should tell this House where we stand with regard to the world millennium development goals. How much was pledged and how much has actually been provided and spent? Where are we on the undertakings given at the conference in Johannesburg?In Uganda life expectancy is less than 43 years. What people do not realise is that after the Cancun talks, in order to comply with WTO rules, Uganda has been told to wind up chicken farming. These aspects of an indigenous, ecologically responsible local economy must cease to satisfy externally imposed WTO criteria. There is also the nonsense that we have opened our markets – bar the arms trade – for these poorer countries to sell in. However, if a country produces certain types of fruit and exports them raw – which is impossible – it can qualify for export. However, if the fruit has more than a 25% sugar content, it is ruled out. Another example is in the monopolies of chocolate production. Those poorer countries that produce cocoa are blocked in moving up the value chain and gaining access to markets. It is only a camouflage to say they get everything except arms. It is about delivering what is needed for these economies.The principle issue is an intellectual, moral and political one. Do we allow the poorest economies the right to construct a local, responsible economy to meet their basic needs first? Are we saying that they should press on for a neo-liberal, market, export-led model, irrespective of the consequences. Faced with that, what is being said in our name at the meetings of the IMF and the World Bank? This is what democracy is about.I can translate everything I said into terrible realities. In 1999, $128 million a day was transferred from the poorest countries to the richest in debt repayment. For each additional 1% of GDP that could have been shifted from that to the combined health and education expenditure, child mortality could have been reduced by 24%. Zambia paid $438.5 million, 14% of its GDP, in debt service in 1999. If that had been spent on Zambian health care, infant deaths could have been reduced from 202 per thousand to approximately eight per thousand. Another example is Mali where in 1999 the figure was $88 million in debt relief and $54 million on education and health expenditure.

I congratulate those who have been returned with increased mandates and I commiserate with those parties which have lost seats. All of the outgoing Assembly Members have made a contribution to political progress. Many of them have consistently and courageously promoted dialogue, partnership and reconciliation, often in challenging circumstances. I hope they will remain active in public life and continue to offer their service and experience for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland.It is important to recognise that more than 70% of those elected are from pro-Agreement parties. All of the parties have stated in their election manifestos that they wish to see a stable political process and want to see devolved government work. This in itself, despite the differing perspectives, is an encouraging signal.In the past week, the Taoiseach and I had meetings with Sinn Féin and the SDLP to explore the options for a way forward. Our key priority is to secure a sustainable basis on which the Assembly can be restored and the Executive quickly established. In the coming days and weeks, it is our intention to continue our intensive engagement with all of the parties in Northern Ireland. As already signalled by the Taoiseach, that invitation includes the DUP. I will continue in my ongoing contacts with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and hope to meet him again when the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, meet in London next week to review progress in the light of our contacts with the political parties.As provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, and in accordance with a commitment contained in the joint declaration, the two Governments have now jointly written to the parties in the Assembly seeking their views on the conduct and agenda of the four-year review of the Agreement. As has been stressed by the two Governments, this review will examine the operation of the Agreement. It will not renegotiate its fundamentals.Both Governments will also continue, through the framework of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to take forward the implementation of the range of commitments outlined in the joint declaration. In addition, the various all-island implementation bodies continue to exercise their important public functions and the British-Irish Council continues to operate, and met on 28 November at summit level in Cardiff.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I thank the Minister for his reply. I join him in wishing those who were elected well and commiserating with those who have lost their seats and have given such public service.With a view to making political progress in Northern Ireland and on the island generally, would the Minister agree that those whose loved ones died in the Monaghan and Dublin bombings deserve truth and justice? In pursuing that we should not correct an injustice by doing another injustice to the reputations of others by denigrating them when their duty was to ensure that the terrible turmoil that happened in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, did not spill over into the South.In that regard, would the Minister agree that it would help the process if the Barron report and the output of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights were to be the first tranche of a truth and reconciliation commission examination? If such a truth and reconciliation commission were established it could go on to hold hearings about the atrocities at Omagh, La Mon and Enniskillen. It might have more success than a public inquiry, which might not reach conclusions. A truth and reconciliation commission with powers to grant amnesty and recommend compensation might allow for everybody involved over the 30 year period to render an account, make amends where appropriate and seek forgiveness. This in turn might being closure and advance the peace process.Has the Minister given any consideration to such a truth and reconciliation commission along the lines of that which operated so well in South Africa? Would he see merit in considering such a proposal as a means of dealing with the various issues and bringing them to closure?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I have not given detailed consideration to establishing such a commission. As envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement, the implementation group has been discussing ways and means in which the victims of violence can be acknowledged and helped under the process of peace and reconciliation.I welcome the publication of the Barron report, which I hope will go some way to giving answers to the families of those killed and injured in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. As the Deputy is aware, the Barron report has been referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for consideration and I do not want to pre-empt the work of the committee by commenting further at this stage. The committee will report back to the Dáil and Seanad within three months with its findings on whether the Barron report addresses all the issues covered in the inquiry's terms of reference, the lessons to be drawn, any actions to be taken in light of the report and whether a public inquiry into any aspects of the report would be required or fruitful.

Arising from the recent elections, does the Minister envisage there will be an Executive in Northern Ireland this side of St. Patrick's Day?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Both Governments are committed to seeing if such a prospect is available to us. We all know that the best outcome for all the people of Northern Ireland is for the Good Friday Agreement to work in all its aspects. The institutions are the democratic core of the Agreement. In his public comments the Taoiseach has outlined that under the paragraph 8 review, we are anxious to see if, in conjunction with the British Government, we can find a basis consistent with the objectives and aims of the Agreement to proceed with the establishment of all of the institutions, which would be in the interest of the people.As I said, more than 70% of the people voted for parties that support the Agreement. We respect the mandates of all parties and I am encouraged by some public comments made in the aftermath of the elections in which people seem to be exploring how they can constructively engage within the framework of a paragraph 8 review. In recognising the mandates, I hope there can be a full recognition of the responsibilities that are now thrust upon us all to make this work consistent with the Agreement that was endorsed by the people on both sides of the Border in 1998.

It demonstrates that rational discourse from civil society on both sides is possible. Furthermore, the initiative proposes a solution to final status issues such as the right of return of Palestinians and the division of Jerusalem.I hope the formal launch of the Geneva accord, which took place on 1 December, will provide some impetus for dialogue and negotiations between the two sides in the conflict. Ireland was represented at the ceremony to launch the accord by our ambassador to Switzerland. The Nobel peace prize laureate, John Hume, was among the distinguished international speakers.The authors of the initiative have indicated that they will wish to discuss their ideas with us, as we are about to hold the EU Presidency and I look forward to this contact. The authors of the accord are currently undertaking consultations with various international figures, including the US Secretary of State. The EU foreign and security policy representative, Dr. Javier Solana, has invited the authors of the accord to discuss it with him in Brussels.The international quartet roadmap remains the blueprint for a settlement as it contains all the elements which must form part of any comprehensive peace package. The measures envisaged by the Geneva accord do not conflict with the roadmap, but give some indication of how the difficult problems associated with final status issues might be addressed.

In the context of it being of assistance to the quartet proposals and the roadmap for peace, following meetings between authors of the Geneva initiative and the Government, which is about to assume the Presidency of the European Union, will the topic be specifically addressed by seeking to bring together the two initiatives during the period of the Irish Presidency?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Although the Israeli Government's initial reaction to it is disappointing, the accord proposes solutions to problems which must be solved prior to the formation of an independent Palestinian state. The accord demonstrates that there are parties on both sides of the conflict who are willing to address these final status issues in a rational manner. It is particularly important during difficult periods, such as the present one, that contacts between civil society representatives should be fostered and encouraged.The Middle East dossier will be a prominent file during Ireland's EU Presidency despite the rather pessimistic background against which we are operating. Our problem at the moment is to get phase 1 of the road map operational to move towards final status issues related to phase 3. As I have said, the Geneva accord is helpful as it demonstrates that people on both sides are prepared to confront these issues rationally and to set out a prospectus which suggests what a solution will look like in the final analysis. Unfortunately, the failures of parliaments in respect of the first and second phases of the road map mean we are not yet at the stage when the governments and the Palestinian authority will sit down to discuss the detail of agreement on final status issues.As I have said, I hope the publication and support of the accord will provide an impetus to talks which have been stalled for far too long. A political track forward needs to be found quickly.

Is the Minister of the opinion that progress is possible given the current Government's attitude and its total rejection of the overwhelming will of the United Nations by the building of a dividing wall?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The comment of the Israeli Government pre-dated a meeting I held with its Foreign Minister. The meeting, which took place in Brussels, involved a very civil and frank exchange of views. I look forward to working with Israel's Foreign Minister, Mr. Silvan Shalom.Rather than accept the idea that the Irish Presidency will be a particularly difficult one, my job will be to present the European Union stance. That is the Presidency's responsibility. We must move away from the idea that the EU is hostile to any one side in terms of trying to facilitate agreement and dialogue. While some elements of the Israeli Government and public opinion do not agree, our approach is even-handed. There are many in Israel who recognise the benefits of the Quartet approach. The Quartet approach should prevent the use of governments on either side of the Atlantic as proxies for particular positions. The Quartet road map has the potential to overcome the perception of governments as proxies by parties in the Middle East region itself. I look forward to making every effort with the high representative and others to bring our particular experience of peace building to bear on the Middle East situation.The initial requirement is a ceasefire. The Palestinian Authority and the Prime Minister are working hard to achieve that at the moment. Even if it is not accepted fully, we must continue to make the case that Israel's security is best guaranteed by political perspective which will effect a just and equitable solution to this problem. We cannot achieve peace and stability in the region without adopting a realistic political perspective which will be supported by all sides with the momentum called for by the road map.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	244	A key role of Ireland's embassies and consulates abroad is the promotion of Irish trade, investment and other interests, including culture. The functions of this role are carried out in close co-operation with other Departments, State agencies and the private sector. This co-operation ensures that the State's network of diplomatic and consular missions adds real value to this task.Embassies and consular missions perform a range of representational and promotional functions in the economic and cultural spheres. These include hosting business support functions, conferences, seminars, exhibitions, readings, book and music launches and debates. Irish embassies and residences abroad represent a valuable State. Hosting Irish-related events at an embassy location can provide a uniquely Irish ambience for an event while offering support to a State agency, business, cultural or other group.Local circumstances dictate when and what can be appropriately hosted in State properties. Our network of embassies should generally be available to host events which promote Ireland's interests in the political, economic or cultural spheres. No fee is charged by an embassy when it is hosting events which promote Ireland's commercial and cultural interests. In certain cases, the costs of such events are met from the embassy's representational budget. In other cases, however, the cost of an event may be borne by its organisers. While it is difficult to put a figure on the cost or gain to the Exchequer, it is my belief that any short-term costs are offset by the long-term increase in interest in Ireland.

There seem to be some difficulties in drawing a distinction between a goodwill function and one which has a strong commercial element. My attention was drawn to this area when the Taoiseach's son-in-law was provided with the use of the Irish Embassy in London to launch his latest CD. I do not raise the matter to suggest inappropriate behaviour on the part of the Taoiseach, I simply draw attention to the fact that embassies are funded by Irish taxpayers. It is interesting to note the way in which they are used. It is important that Members of the Oireachtas know about this as we are answerable to the taxpayers in respect of the circumstances in which Irish embassies are used.Does an ambassador follow a protocol in these cases, or is the decision at his or her discretion? If an event is strongly commercial in nature, must it first be cleared with the Department of Foreign Affairs? As the Minister has pointed out, no fee is charged at any stage. That is interesting. I suppose we do not want to make the accusation that events can be used as political opportunities. However, I sometimes wonder what is the purpose of events such as the wedding reception which the Lord Mayor of Dublin hosted in the Mansion House and how they serve the taxpayer.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The costs in respect of the specific event mentioned by the Deputy were borne by the organisers. No costs were incurred by the State. The use of the embassy for the launch of the CD in question was assessed as providing an excellent opportunity to promote Ireland and Irish music. I am of the opinion that our network of embassies should generally be available to host events which promote Ireland's interests.There are no set criteria regarding what events can or cannot be hosted at an embassy. The knowledge and experience of officials on the ground and local circumstances dictate what can appropriately be hosted in State properties and when an event may take place. Our network of embassies is a valuable asset to the State and should generally be available to host events which promote Ireland's political, economic, cultural or tourism interests.No costs were incurred by the State during the recent use of the London embassy to mark the fifth anniversary of the existence of the group in question and the launch of its new CD. All costs were borne by the organisers. Similar events have been hosted in the embassy, including the recent reception for the Irish Youth Foundation and the launch of a music CD of the late Rory Gallagher. As with the Westlife launch, the latter event was fully sponsored by the record company involved. Several receptions for the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and An Bord Bia were fully sponsored by those bodies. Launches of books about Robert Emmet and WB Yeats also took place at the embassy. A lunch was held for the Irish Chamber Orchestra.

Dialogue between the EU and the US will take place at foreign minister and senior official level during the Presidency. While it is too early to indicate in detail the topics for discussion during the summit, the agenda will embrace political, economic and trade issues, as well as other areas of co-operation. A strong and close relationship between the EU and the US is important for the growth and prosperity of both sides. It can provide a basis for international peace and security. I look forward to working closely with the US to develop this important relationship during our Presidency.

It is a good, healthy and useful development. It will help Ireland to increase its influence and improve relations between the EU and the US. Reports in the US have suggested that a number of EU member states, including Ireland, are to be excluded from applying for contracts to carry out certain works in Iraq. I understand there will be a total budget of €15.2 billion for 26 contracts. On what basis has the United States decided on such an exclusion? Will the Minister support the EU's stated intention of raising these matters strongly with the US Government? Ireland, which has facilitated the efforts of the United States in Iraq by allowing overflights and refuelling to take place here, has been placed behind countries like Tonga and the Marshall Islands. Does the Minister agree with the comments of US Senator John Kerry, who said he could not think of anything dumber, more insulting or more inciting? Will he raise this matter forcefully with the US Administration?

We await Commissioner Patten's advice to the Council on the matter. I understand at this remove, without having had a detailed appraisal of the issue, that it relates to moneys being provided by the United States for the reconstruction of Iraq. Neither I nor the embassy officials have had an opportunity to make inquiries about the basis of the inclusions and exclusions from the list. I understand that the US decision does not affect sub-contracting. I am not aware of many Irish companies that have declared an interest in reconstruction issues in Iraq. Detailed inquiries are being made in respect of this issue, which has arisen in the last day or two. As soon as full information is available, we can take it from there.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The proposed arrangements for the ratification of the new EU draft constitutional treaty are quite clear. They involve no change from the existing arrangements. When unanimous agreement has been achieved among Governments at the Intergovernmental Conference, the treaty must be ratified by all member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. Nobody has seriously challenged this requirement at the conference. Ireland will not support an alternative approach. The new treaty will not enter into force if it is not ratified by all member states. A decision by a member state not to ratify the treaty can have no legal bearing on the state's membership of the Union. It is obvious that political difficulties will arise if one or more member states experiences difficulty in ratifying the treaty. In such circumstances, all member states will have to come together to see what can be done.Although we must await the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference, I cannot envisage why the Irish people should not react positively to the new treaty in due course. Most of the positive aspects of the new treaty as proposed by the European Convention are not being contested at the conference and will stand. Many of the issues in respect of which we have raised concerns are being addressed as the negotiations progress. The Government will continue to work to defend Ireland's interests. The views expressed by the President of the Commission are his own. Although the Commission attends the Intergovernmental Conference as an observer, the Governments of the member states make decisions and sign treaties.

What is the Irish view of this suggestion? How will the Minister react to the comments this weekend? Will the Minister accept that he is not wearing any clothes, so to speak, in respect of Irish neutrality? The new Article 40.7 has been designed as a fig leaf to hide the Minister's nakedness. Does the Minister agree that the new Article 40.7 constitutes a mutual defence clause? It states clearly that "member states shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance". That constitutes a mutual defence clause. Ireland's suggestion that it should be made clear that the Union's security and defence policy "shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states" is nothing more than Jesuitical nonsense.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	277	An inability to listen to answers is part of Deputy Gormley's problem. The Deputy also raised certain defence issues. It is important to point out that we have provided the safeguard clause since Maastricht. We negotiated the clause at Maastricht, as it was clear that there are different defence and security policy traditions in the European Union. The Community method involves accommodating those traditions. Deputy Gormley has always failed to acknowledge that successive Governments have been involved in successful negotiations. When a defence working group, of which Deputy Gormley is a member, produced a proposal which left me with very little room to manoeuvre, I was capable of negotiating Ireland's position and ensuring that its tradition is respected. The safeguard clause ensures that there is no automaticity involved in such a mutual defence clause, as far as Ireland is concerned. The whole purpose of our negotiating strategy is to achieve that. It is far better to acknowledge that something has been achieved, rather than denying it.One should not suggest, as Deputy Gormley sought to do, that the phraseology has been developed as a cover. It has been included in treaties since the Treaty of Maastricht, when European security and defence policy was first given a base in the EU treaties. I have said that it is there to acknowledge the fact that there are different defence and security policy traditions in the EU. We respect those with other traditions and we obtain mutual respect for our tradition. Regarding our position—

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	279	—in respect of neutrality, there is no change in our legislative or constitutional arrangements. We will update the treaty references in the event of a successful outcome to this treaty process. We will put a proposal to the people. We will ensure that our constitutional protections are updated by means of an updated treaty reference. We will maintain independence of action. There will be no automaticity. Decisions on the participation by Ireland in the European security and defence policy arrangements will be taken by the sovereign Government, with the approval of Parliament. That is a fair outcome and is what we sought to achieve. It has been respected and it should be acknowledged.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	280	On a number of occasions in recent months, I have set out the Government's position regarding Tibet. Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, and has, from that time, recognised Tibet as an integral part of China. The Government has consistently called on the Chinese authorities to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people. We will continue to address our ongoing concerns regarding the protection of human rights in Tibet, along with the general human rights situation in China, both bilaterally and within the framework of the EU-China human rights dialogue, as well as through appropriate action at the UN, including at the Commission on Human Rights.In that regard, I am encouraged by China's first ever policy paper on the EU, published on 13 October 2003, which includes a commitment to continue dialogue, exchange and co-operation with the EU in the area of human rights. More specifically, it calls on EU representatives to visit Tibet and welcomes EU support for the economic, cultural, educational and social development of Tibet.Mrs. Kesang Takla, the London-based representative of the Dalai Lama, is scheduled to visit Dublin later this month. In the course of her visit she will meet with my colleague, Deputy Kitt, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development assistance and human rights, on 18 December 2003, to discuss the current situation in Tibet. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, had a similar meeting with Mrs. Takla in September 2002. I understand that Mrs. Takla is also scheduled to brief the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.During her state visit to China, from 6 to 16 October 2003, President McAleese had meetings with both President Hu and Premier Wen. In the course of wide-ranging discussions, the President conveyed Ireland's general commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The issue of Tibet was not specifically raised, given that our more specific human rights concerns, including those relating to individual regions and cases, are the subject of regular and ongoing official meetings and contacts between the two Governments as described above, which are the most appropriate fora for addressing such specific concerns.I assure the Deputy that, within the existing frameworks, Ireland will continue to call on the Chinese authorities to respect fully the rights of the Tibetan people, and to voice our support for genuine dialogue with the Dalai Lama.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I realise that the Minister has access to information from meetings with visiting representatives such as those mentioned and through various different sources. How does the Minister keep in touch with the situation on the ground in a place such as Tibet, where we clearly do not have an embassy or permanent diplomatic representation on the ground? Does he know the last time a Minister visited Tibet, and how regularly do officials in his Department or from our embassy in Beijing visit Tibet? Is the situation on the ground monitored from time to time, or do we rely on reports from other sources?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I can find out when the last ministerial visit to that region took place. I know from personal knowledge that the ambassador to China based in Beijing has been in Tibet on several occasions and is quite aware of the situation, keeping up to date with it as far as he can. We also rely on the European Union. We have an EU-China dialogue. I was in attendance as a member of the Troika at a meeting of that dialogue in New York during the General Assembly deliberations in September. Those issues were raised then.The best way to describe the Government's position is that we feel that the best way to achieve progress regarding the situation in Tibet is through meaningful dialogue between the Government in Beijing and the Dalai Lama. As I said, in that regard I welcome the reports of positive dialogue between Chinese officials and a delegation of the Dalai Lama's envoys when the latter visited China during the summer following the change of leadership in China. I am disappointed that there seems to have been no follow-up to that visit, but we expect to obtain a full assessment when Mrs. Takla visits Dublin later this month.It is also important to point out that in March 2002 the Dalai Lama wrote to the Foreign Ministers of EU member states, including me, asking that the EU appoint a special representative for Tibet. In a joint response at that time, the EU Ministers were unanimously of the view that nominating an EU special representative would not achieve anything practical. That position has not changed, and it remains the shared view of EU Ministers that our concerns regarding Tibet are most usefully expressed to the Chinese authorities directly.The EU restated its position on Tibet and raised its concerns at the reports of torture in prisons in Tibet. In response, the Chinese authorities gave an undertaking to investigate any specific complaints of torture, stating that prisons in Tibet were subject to the same regulations as prisons in the provinces. The Chinese delegation also referred to the recent discussions between the Chinese Government and the envoys of the Dalai Lama, indicating its readiness to engage in further discussions. We believe that is how we should proceed.

Raising matters directly with the Chinese authorities had some limited success regarding the whereabouts of some people being held. Frankly, however, I got the impression that visits by our ambassador to China were very difficult to arrange and were merely tolerated by the Chinese authorities. I, and perhaps all the members of the visiting delegation, would say that what was taking place was a kind of cultural genocide being visited on the Tibetan people. The economic, social and cultural realities were appalling. I put it to the Minister that he will not get very far by continuing with what was going on just now. There must be an escalation of European Union concern. We should drive on and offer ourselves during the Irish Presidency to facilitate a breakthrough regarding contact between representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Regarding a breakthrough, contact has already been established this summer. We have been disappointed by the lack of follow-on, but we will obviously continue with those efforts and, as President of the European Union in March, we will be able to consider how to address the question of human rights in China during the session of the Commission on Human Rights. That is another area in which we can advance the dialogue in a way which the Deputies would like.

Seven informal ministerial meetings, six in Ireland and one in Brussels, as well as other high-level ministerial meetings and conferences, will also be held during the Presidency, and I have arranged that a calendar of such high-level meetings giving details of dates and locations be deposited in the Oireachtas Library and kept regularly updated.The agendas and topics to be discussed at each meeting are a matter for each Minister involved but in all cases are dependent on several factors, including the outcome of the remaining Council meetings under the Italian Presidency. I will be hosting an informal EU Foreign Ministers' meeting in Tullamore on 16 and 17 April 2004. That meeting will provide EU Foreign Ministers with an opportunity for in-depth discussion, and consideration is currently being given to appropriate areas for discussion.In addition, I will host a meeting of EU-ASEM Foreign Ministers, bringing together EU Ministers with ten of their Asian counterparts in Kildare on 17 and 18 April and a scheduled mid-term EuroMed ministerial meeting, which will provide an opportunity for dialogue between EU Foreign Ministers and their Mediterranean counterparts, on 5 and 6 May in Dublin.On the external relations side, I envisage that we will hold five summits during our Presidency in the first half of 2004. The Taoiseach will co-host the EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit with the Mexican President, Vicente Fox, which will take place in Mexico on 28 and 29 May 2004. An EU-Russia and an EU-Japan summit are likely to take place during our Presidency, in Russia and Japan, respectively. We are also scheduled to hold an EU-Canada summit during our Presidency. Finally, we expect that an EU-US summit will take place in Ireland during our Presidency and we are working closely with the US side to establish dates.The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, will host a meeting in Wicklow in April 2004, on the theme of communicating Europe and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, will host an informal EU development ministers meeting in Dublin on 31 May and 1 June and also a major conference entitled Breaking the Barriers – Partnership to fight HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia in Dublin on 23 and 24 February.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Arising out of the last summit during the Italian Presidency, the Council decided to instruct the Commission to review all aspects of the EU-Russia agenda to see where we stand in regard to all the issues in order that we could prepare for it. We must emphasise the need for reciprocity in regard to these dialogues. There are issues for both sides which need to be advanced and we need to see progress on both sides. I am not sure the issues which the Deputy raises will form part of the agenda – it is too early to say. The Commission will revert to the Council with a full review of where we stand on the issues in order that we can decide how to proceed.

#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	320	It is a matter for the Dáil who it decides to invite, rather than any individual Minister.Will the Minister consider a precedent set by the previous Irish Presidency, wherein a special meeting was held in Cork on rural development which contributed to a substantial budgetary provision for rural development, which has not yet been quantified, which was agreed at the summit in Brussels in October 2002? Does the Minister agree it would be a useful initiative for the Irish Presidency to seek to bring this matter further and put substance on the commitment which the EU is now making to rural development? This commitment has the support of the Government, but has its origins in the special meeting organised by the previous Irish Presidency in Cork.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I freely acknowledge that meetings during the previous Presidency have brought great benefit to the country and the EU generally. The Deputy outlined a particular issue which is of importance to Ireland and the EU. I will refer his suggestion to the Ministers for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and Agriculture and Food to see what way it might be taken up.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 55 together.The Irish Shot at Dawn campaign is seeking retrospective pardons for 26 Irish men executed by the British Army during the First World War for offences such as desertion and cowardice, which were consequently repealed by the British authorities in 1928 and 1930. The Irish campaign is ancillary to the British Shot at Dawn campaign, which is seeking pardons for 306 British soldiers executed, a figure which includes the 26 Irishmen in question.I have instructed my officials to begin discussions with their British counterparts. We will do this in tandem with our ongoing contacts with Mr. Mulvaney, the Irish Shot at Dawn campaign co-ordinator. We will focus on the safety of the courts-martial convictions, the level of convictions against soldiers from Ireland, the lack of consideration of ameliorating medical conditions suffered by soldiers at the time, and the repeal of, inter alia, the offences of desertion and cowardice in the aftermath of the war, will inform our approach.Moreover, our approach will also be informed by the humanitarian considerations which inspired the Government of New Zealand to pass the Pardons for Soldiers of the Great War Act 2000, the purpose of which was effectively to grant such retrospective pardons and to exonerate the soldiers from New Zealand from the opprobrium of a fate they did not deserve.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	325	Deputy Higgins's question is first.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The question is in Deputy McManus's name, I have a question in my own name.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The Chair is acting in accordance with long-established precedent. There is nothing out of the ordinary in this.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Does the Minister agree with those of us who tabled questions on this matter, that these are appalling crimes which have no place in a humane regime? One of the crimes for which people could be shot at dawn was falling asleep on duty. In his reply, the Minister referred to the safety of convictions. However, surely the issue is not that but that these offences existed at all. This was a war in which 80% of the casualties were service men, whereas now 80% of the people who die are civilians.Will the Minister specify whether we will raise this matter directly with the British authorities in order to restore the good name of the people involved rather than examining on a narrow legal basis, the safety of their conviction for crimes which have no place in any civilised society.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I do not disagree with the Deputy's sentiments. There is no issue between us on this matter. The reason I have pledged support for the Shot at Dawn campaign is that each of the 26 Irishmen was executed for an offence which was repealed by the British Army and Air Force Act 1930, demonstrating that the parliamentary and public belief at the time was that the executions were unduly harsh. The number of courts-martial condemnations enlisted from Ireland was significantly higher than that experienced by other nationalities. A review of the levels of convictions indicates that soldiers from Ireland were four times more likely to suffer execution. Even though it was understood at the time, the horrific impact of the Great War on the mental state of soldiers was not addressed to any extent by the British authorities and was not taken into consideration by the systems of court-martial. The humanitarian approach adopted by the Government of New Zealand highlights that retrospective pardons can and should be provided. As that Act states: "These men suffered a fate they did not deserve".
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I am pleased the Minister is supporting this campaign. He will be aware that up to 26 out of 306 soldiers are believed to have been born in Ireland. That is a disproportionate number given the relative sizes of the population. People like former Fine Gael Deputy, Paddy Harte, have taken the lead in the campaign on this issue.If the legislation existed during the time of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and given that the Republic is a successor State, will the Minister say if the Irish Government has the power to issue a pardon to the 26 soldiers whom it is believed came from Ireland? Can some mechanism be found by which that could be done in the event of the British Government not issuing the required pardon?
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Or other governments.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I have not heard that argument before. I will consider it though I am not sure what legal basis one has in that regard. British military rules and regulations at the time dictated the fate of these men. I will try to assist the people involved in this campaign. It is right that I should do so.I have had a number of official meetings with Mr. Peter Mulvaney, the co-ordinator of Shot at Dawn. We have carefully researched this matter and have sought to be as informed as possible before making any decisions on the veracity of the case. This is an example of a further advance in the acceptance that service in the British army prior to independence was part of our heritage and consequently our concern for the welfare and treatment of soldiers is the next logical step towards our acceptance of that time.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Will the Minister agree that all the men shot were volunteers and not conscripts and that most of them were members of Irish regiments recruited in this State? Will he further agree that this Government is a successor in terms of legal authority to the government which recruited these men and that, therefore, rather than looking to the British to issue a pardon, given that Britain no longer has any jurisdiction in the area from which these men came, the appropriate authority to issue a pardon is this Government, of which he is a member.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I am not so sure the Deputy is correct or that it is possible to do what he suggests. I have not heard that argument before but I will consider it.The executions were carried out under British military legislation in a Westminster parliament. The means by which this wrong can be undone must come from within that legal framework. I cannot give a "Yes" or "No" answer to the Deputy. I do not know the answer to his question. As I said earlier to Deputy Gay Mitchell, I will investigate all avenues to find a way to be of assistance in this regard.The review of the matter carried out in 1998 by the British Government raises more questions than it answers by concluding that all those executed were victims of the war while simultaneously reaffirming that the convictions stand. These positions are incompatible. The case for a pardon is strong when one adds to it that Irishmen were far more likely than other nationals to be executed. The passage of time argument does not hold up. Much time has been lost because the British military, for 70 years, sealed the files of those executed. If there was sufficient evidence to convict, those records should be equally amenable to review.The success of those who lobbied the British Government in the immediate aftermath of the Great War and who radically changed the military court-martial system in such a dramatic fashion, epitomises the depth of feeling on this contentious issue and puts paid to the argument that public opinion of the time supported the military system of justice. We are not holding up modern standards against those prevailing at the time but those who questioned those standards.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	335	Will the Minister agree that if we were to establish a tribunal of inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry Act 1921, a British statute, we would ask the British Government to set it up for us? Likewise, if these men were executed under legislation passed by the united parliament of Great Britain and Ireland, the sovereign authority in this State until 1921, the appropriate successor authority with the power to pardon these men is the Irish Government?The Minister said that legislation was repealed in Britain in 1930. If it was on the British statute book up to 1930 and was extant in 1918, presumably it was also on our Statute Book. Will the Minister indicate if that legislation has been repealed here in so far as it affects the Irish Defence Forces?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	336	As I do not have supplementary information in that regard, I will forward a reply to the Deputy. While I cannot accede to his argument, I will consider it.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	342	There is no need to argue about the matter.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	343	We are here to argue on such matters.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Is the Minister aware of the British Government's response to this campaign and is he optimistic about its role in forthcoming pardons for the 306 soldiers involved? Will a decision be made in the near future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	345	While a review carried out by the British Government in 1998 stated it acknowledged these people were victims of war, it was not, for many reasons, in a position to issue a pardon. That is the reason the campaign continues and is why we should explore all avenues, including those mentioned by Deputies John Bruton and Gay Mitchell.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I have no knowledge or details of the flight path of the aircraft in question. However, I can confirm that no requests have been received by my Department for the overflight of armed US military aircraft during the period in question.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I thank the Minister for his brief reply. I tabled this question following representations from a journalist that such an aircraft, accompanied by fighter jets, had crossed over Irish territory. It makes sense for such an aircraft flying to Britain to cross Irish territory. What other route could it take?Is the Minister confident his Department is always notified about military aircraft crossing over Irish air space? Do we have the necessary technology to detect military aircraft overflying Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The management, control and monitoring of Irish airspace is a matter for the Department of Transport and the Irish Aviation Authority, the latter having operational responsibility in this area. I have every confidence the appropriate authorities are fully aware of aviation activities taking place in Irish airspace.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	349	If the Minister is confident we are notified about such operations, why is it he has no knowledge of this flight? Is the Department of Foreign Affairs notified about such operations? Which Department has responsibility in this area, is it the Department of Defence? The Minister said he has every confidence the appropriate authorities are fully aware of aviation activities. There seems to be a bit of a dark hole on this occasion in that nobody knows if such an aircraft flew over Irish air space.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I have no details of such a flight. I have every confidence the appropriate authorities would be aware if such a flight had taken place.Under the terms of Foreign Military Aircraft Order 1952 permission for foreign military aircraft to overfly Irish territory must be sought from the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Such permission is normally granted when the aircraft carries no arms or ammunitions. No request for the overflight of armed military aircraft was received for the period in question.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I propose, in 2004, to ask the Government for authority to arrange for the drafting of legislation to amend the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts 1967 and 1976.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is not one which brings forward a significant body of legislation and, at this stage, it is not clear what, if any, issues may become a priority during the course of 2004 requiring the Department to bring forward further legislation.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	361	Can the Minister broadly indicate the intent of the legislation to which he referred? Will he consider introducing legislation providing for a travel document, which would be of less significance than a passport but which would be useful for Irish citizens travelling within the European Union? I have raised this matter on a number of previous occasions. While we often speak of being both Irish and European citizens, Ireland is soon to be one of only two in 25 countries whose citizens will have to produce passports while travelling in the Schengen area. While I understand the reasons for this, the change would help allay the separateness that people feel from the EU. This could be done by Irish legislation. It would be an EU travel document that could perhaps double as a driving licence. While it would not be an identity card for use within the State, it would suffice as a travel card within the EU. While we will soon ask people to approve the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference and tell them they are citizens of both Ireland and the EU, it will be hard to convince them of this when they must travel on a passport.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	362	While it is unrelated to the Deputy's question, I will seek to determine what is the official view on this. Much of it arises as a result of heightened security and many regard it as necessary for their own safety that the authorities are able to identify all aircraft passengers.Under the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Acts, the Government may, by order, make provision for international organisations and bodies and related persons to have privileges and immunities in the context of international relations. The constitutionality of this provision has been raised by the Attorney General because of the wide discretion it gives to the Government in the making of such orders. The proposed amending legislation is designed to limit the Government's discretion in the making of the orders in question in a way that would remedy the aforementioned constitutional concern while not impinging on the general prerogative of the Government to make orders.

I do not understand the difficulty in publishing it as it is the outcome of a court decision. The Minister suggested this is the only part of his legislative programme. I would have thought that the completion of the ratification of the different obligations we have under the UN would have been included. For example, resolution 1368 was passed in response to the attacks in the United States in September 2001, while there is a list of instruments requiring ratification. Consideration should also be given to other legislation in the general rights area. Are these not part of the legislative programme?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	367	Before addressing this question, I would like to express my deepest sympathy to the family of the late Sergeant Derek Mooney who died tragically on 27 November while serving the cause of peace in Liberia through his service with UNMIL. I would also like to convey my sympathy and best wishes to the members of the Irish contingent who were injured on 27 November.The House will be aware that on 24 September 2003, the Government authorised, subject to Dáil approval, the dispatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mission in Liberia. The Dáil gave its approval on 12 November to the deployment when my colleague, the Minister for Defence, moved the necessary enabling resolution in the House. I refer the House to the Minister's comprehensive statement on 12 November.The Irish contingent comprises a motorised infantry battalion of some 430 personnel, along with a small number of additional personnel deployed at force headquarters and as military observers. At the request of the UN, a contingent of the Army Ranger Wing, amounting to some 40 personnel, has been deployed for a three-month period. The main Irish contingent will operate as the force commander's rapid reaction reserve. Its role will be the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis. In the initial stages, the Irish battalion will act in a path-finding role for UN brigades deploying beyond Monrovia. Deployment to UNMIL will be completed this month. Initial deployment will be for one year, with a possible extension thereafter, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission. In the case of UNMIL, it is not envisaged that Defence Forces involvement will exceed two to three years in duration.Deputies will be aware that the national transitional Government of Liberia was inaugurated in Monrovia on 14 October 2003. Mr. Gyude Bryant succeeded interim president Moses Blah on that date and the former will serve as chairman of the transitional Government until parliamentary and presidential elections are held before the end of 2005. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, represented the Government at the inauguration. On taking office, Mr. Bryant pledged to introduce transparency in government and respect for human rights. The process of selecting members of the transitional government and legislative assembly is ongoing. The disarmament campaign was formally launched on 1 December.Despite recent improvements in security in UN-controlled areas and progress in the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement, signed by the parties in Accra on 18 August, the peace process remains fragile. The Government believes the deployment of UNMIL is critically important in supporting the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement and for the political and economic recovery of Liberia. The Government will lend active support to the work of the United Nations special representative in Liberia, Jacques Klein, and to the EU special representative for the region, Hans Dahlgren, in his efforts to co-ordinate EU support for peace and reconstruction in this part of Africa. This will be a priority for the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Union. Through our Presidency, we will also continue to encourage all parties to the comprehensive peace agreement to carry out their commitments and obligations.

The assessment also termed the security threat as medium. Given the presence of UNMIL and the medical arrangements that have been made, does the Minister envisage that the risk assessment will soon be adjusted downwards?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	369	I am not aware that the assessment will be adjusted downwards. This is a difficult mission. I know some of the soldiers involved in it and they are happy with how well equipped they are and, being professional soldiers, are looking forward to the challenge presented by the mission. The Minister for Defence is dealing with this matter and the Deputy will be aware that a detailed reconnaissance and threat assessment was undertaken prior to deployment in the mission area by a Defence Forces team.I am aware that every reasonable step has been taken to ensure the good health of our personnel on this mission. The battalion will be equipped with a state-of-the-art medical facility and will bring its own water purification plant. The availability of back-up medical arrangements has also been ensured. A full surgical medical facility has been provided to the mission, initially by the Netherlands, which has dispatched a fully equipped naval hospital ship to Liberia to provide medical assistance facilities to the mission, and thereafter by Jordan. There is also a Red Cross medical facility in Monrovia and a full surgical medical facility in Freetown.The reports of fighting yesterday are of grave concern. It appears the fighting involved former government militia men protesting about the size of the initial payment they will receive as part of the programme of progressive disarmament. The actions of the fighters involved were met with a swift response by UNMIL forces while the chairman of Liberia's transitional Government and the UN's special representative in Liberia has roundly condemned their actions.Irish personnel were not involved in the incidents in question. I assure the Deputy that in addition to the intensive preliminary assessment work carried out ahead of the mission, Ireland keeps in close contact with the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations on all aspects of the mission. When the first commander of UNMIL was in New York for a brief period earlier this week, he made sure to meet Ireland's permanent representative to give him a full briefing of events on the ground.

The reconnaissance referred to in the Minister of Defence's statement to the House operates on two levels, that of the United Nations and that of the Irish Government. Does the Minister believe the reconnaissance of Liberian infrastructure, in terms of roads, security, etc., was adequate?My second question, which pertains to the adequacy of the medical preparations, has been asked already. I raised with the Minister for Defence the adequacy of the preventative measures against water-borne illnesses. I will be happy if the Minister for Foreign Affairs assures us in this regard. Will any Minister be visiting the Irish troops in Liberia between now and the beginning of the next Dáil session?

The troops have just arrived, as the Deputy knows, and are settling in. Obviously, we see from certain incidents that their mission is very difficult and we must continue to hope and pray that they will all return home safely.On the reconnaissance of the infrastructure in Liberia, everyone would have been aware of the poor transport infrastructure because of the wars and conflicts in the country, which have been ongoing for many years. The accident that led to the death of Sergeant Mooney was, unfortunately, one for which nobody could have legislated. It was just an unfortunate road accident.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	373	I will obtain details of the second part of the Deputy's question. From speaking to UN personnel, I know how highly regarded Irish Army rangers are. They were particularly highly regarded during their mission in East Timor. They have dealt with very difficult circumstances most professionally. That the UN sought an additional 30 members of the Irish Army ranger wing confirms how highly they are esteemed.On 14 November, Interpol issued an arrest warrant for Charles Taylor citing his indictment for war crimes in Sierra Leone. The warrant was issued in response to his indictment earlier this year by the special court for Sierra Leone for crimes against humanity and serious violations of international and humanitarian law. These charges related to his sponsorship of the Revolutionary United Front during the civil war in Sierra Leone.Ireland appreciates Nigeria's role in facilitating the departure of Charles Taylor from Liberia. However, Ireland believes strongly that those guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity should be made accountable. Ireland is a strong supporter of the special court for Sierra Leone and has been one of its most generous donors, providing $500,000 dollars for the first three years of its operation and a further $250,000 in recent weeks.

We are operating against a very difficult background and I refer the Deputy to my detailed responses to priority questions on this subject. We must not become fatalistic or too pessimistic and must continue to work with everyone of good will and speak to the wider community. There are many on both sides doing courageous work trying to maintain basic human contact and dialogue. Despite a pessimistic political outlook, we have to bring every pressure we can to bear on those who have leverage to meet the responsibilities that exist. There is a security threat not only in the immediate area of conflict, but also in the wider region and throughout the world. The conflict in Iraq compounds the situation.

It will be universally welcomed by PDFFORA, which was so ably led by the late John Lucey, who lost his life tragically last year.So many issues have been raised by Dr. Eileen Doyle in her report, Dignity at Work – The Challenge of Workplace Bullying, on bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment of members of the Defence Forces. The report showed that one third of female personnel suffered sexual harassment, and there were many other instances of bullying and discrimination. So often when we hear of sexual harassment we tend to think of the harassment of females, but I assure the House that it applies equally to males in many cases. Sexual harassment of males can also be quite vicious. There is a vicious circle that can be kept in place. When a bully sees the effects of his bullying, he or she is encouraged to continue in the belief that he or she is winning the battle.Some tentative steps have been taken to implement the report's recommendations. This Bill marks a belated but major step in the right direction. Bullying does not occur right across the board in the Army. As in any organisation, a small number of people are involved, but even a small number is too many. I know of instances which commandants have nipped in the bud but there is an issue of awareness involved here. If the authorities are not made aware of bullying it is hard to get a grip on it. Situations arise in which people observe bullying but do not report it, which makes them complicit in the crime.New laws have recently been introduced in the public service to cover bullying and harassment at work. There are major problems in the public service and I am aware of serious cases of bullying in the caring professions. This can have a severe effect on people, leading to staff losing sleep and requesting leave of absence or sick leave as they are not fit to go to work. In extreme cases people have resigned their positions while other victims have required counselling. This is a serious problem which used to be brushed aside but in recent years we have become more aware of it.A new guide on revised policy and procedures on bullying and harassment in interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces was issued in response to the findings of the Doyle report. There have been many well-documented cases of victimisation and bullying in the Defence Forces and the Naval Service, as has happened in the private business environment, schools and so on across the board. The cases usually involve an abuse of authority or a pulling of rank on a vulnerable individual, with ranks being closed afterwards. Soldiers generally felt they got a raw deal as they had no fully independent complaints procedure available to them and until now recourse was generally through the courts. This happened in a plethora of cases which became known as the army deafness claims. We must remember, however, that those being bullied are simply not fit to take cases through the courts. They are not prepared psychologically to do so, which is why cases have rarely gone to court.The army deafness cases became the principal pretext for the formation of PDFORRA and were the issue on which that organisation campaigned for a long time. PDFORRA, representing rank and file members of the Defence Forces, emphasised the need to create a workplace environment which afforded everybody the dignity and respect their membership of the Defence Forces merited. The Office of Defence Forces Ombudsman will be largely instrumental in making visible issues which up to now were both invisible and crushing for the individuals concerned.Many of those who were victimised had to carry this bullying and harassment silently and their station was a lonely one. PDFORRA was active in providing evidence of issues that had not been dealt with previously and in bringing them to the surface. The existence of the Office of Defence Forces Ombudsman will be crucial in making people aware of what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate behaviour in the workplace, but the ordinary man in the street knows what constitutes inappropriate behaviour. People can decide to ignore a colleague or to exclude him or her. Ignoring or not talking to someone can have a devastating effect on the person concerned. It can be a form of bullying but it can be very hard to put one's finger on it. When one asks the complainant what happened, it is hard for him or her to say: "Well, they wouldn't talk to me." There is a balance to be achieved. Bullying can take many forms but its consequences can be devastating.This Bill will make all concerned considerably more sensitive in their dealings with both subordinates and superiors. That can only serve to enhance the Defence Forces' productivity by making its workplace a happier and healthier one, which will be to the benefit of us all. By their nature, the Defence Forces constitute a hierarchical body, with a strictly regimented structure. In that context there is a need for a visible forum, such as the ombudsman, to defuse tensions and deal with various issues of concern to members. Hierarchical structures can also militate against the harmonious working of a defence force, which is something every nation needs. Our nation's security is only as good as the well-being of the Defence Forces. Soldiers on patrol depend on teamwork and trust in colleagues. If that were absent I do not know what would happen in the Defence Forces, particularly on missions to places like Liberia. If there was no teamwork and soldiers did not believe in each other the whole mission could fall apart.The Minister's assurance that the new Office of Defence Forces Ombudsman will be impartial and independent of the chain of command and the Department is welcome. It avoids the possibility of a conflict of interest while ensuring an independent assessment of a grievance, which is very important. It is vital that the Defence Forces Ombudsman maintains the confidence of the public, and particularly the confidence of Defence Forces personnel, who will look at him or her as the final arbiter in resolving their grievances. The appointment of the Defence Forces Ombudsman is a true vindication of all that John Lucey and PDFORRA fought for.

Dar ndóigh, beidh mé ag cur leasaithe chun cinn chun déanamh cinnte go bhfuil foralácha an Bille láidrithe, ach tríd is tríd ba mhaith linn fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo agus cuidiú leis rith tríd an Teach chomh tapaidh agus is féidir.It is appropriate that the Second Stage debate on this Bill opened on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and will continue during this year's 16 days of action against violence against women. It is fitting because it was the revelations in 2001 about the unacceptable level of sexual harassment and assault in the Defence Forces which gave rise to the Doyle report and provided the impetus to drafting the Bill.The report of the external advisory committee on the nature and extent of any harassment, bullying, discrimination and sexual harassment in the Defence Forces, also known as the Doyle report, was commissioned by the Minister for Defence on foot of the revelations of the findings of an earlier report by Dr. Tom Clonan into sexual harassment in the Defence Forces, published in November 2000. Both reports found that whereas women make up only 4% of all soldiers, approximately one third of these women soldiers suffer sexual harassment by colleagues or superior officers. Significantly, the Doyle report found that despite the current complaints procedure, many women in the Defence Forces were and are too afraid to report harassment or rape by their colleagues or superiors. They believed, and some found out, that the current internal complaints system would not result in the justice and redress they deserved.Ultimately the Minister accepted the Doyle report recommendations in full. He acknowledged that the next phase of modernisation of the military requires dealing with this issue, that bullying and harassment have no place in the modern Defence Forces and that the Defence Forces need a new culture and values. PDFORRA has also accepted the report conclusions, and have backed the introduction of this Bill. I welcome these developments.Apart from the introduction of a Defence Forces Ombudsman, the Doyle report made other recommendations, including the establishment of a confidential helpline, which has already been done and the establishment of a monitoring group, already done, to report back in 2004. We look forward to its progress report next year. The report also recommended the establishment of an equality group chaired by a Labour Court member and the establishment of a consultative group. I look forward to the full implementation of all these recommendations.Sinn Féin wants many of the same standards we have promoted for a fully independent Garda Ombudsman to also apply to the Defence Forces Ombudsman. It is appropriate that the Bill proposes an ombudsman established separately from any body charged with a Defence Forces management function, or with a mandate to review the forces' efficiency and effectiveness. I do not understand why, as he considers the complaints structure for the Garda, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is resistant on this point. He should follow the lead of the Minister for Defence on this issue.However, the Bill's provisions should go further. There must be an open, merit-based appointment of the ombudsman, selected on the basis of published criteria. The ombudsman must be adequately resourced and staffed and granted the necessary legal powers and resources to conduct his or her independent investigations. He or she must also be allowed adequate scope for investigations, empowered to investigate systemic problems, including policies and practices, and make general recommendations to eliminate causes of classes of complaints. Where determined necessary by the ombudsman, this should include matters of national security.He or she should be empowered to conduct independent investigations on matters of public interest on his or her own volition or on the request of the Minister and without the need for a complainant. This should be compulsory in the case of certain violations involving loss of life, assault or discrimination. Importantly, the ombudsman should be granted retrospective investigative powers. In conducting his or her investigations, he or she should be authorised to question witnesses, compel document disclosure and access locations as necessary. The provisions in the Bill are mostly satisfactory in this regard, which is welcome.The ombudsman should be empowered to determine breaches of the disciplinary code and to refer evidence of criminality to the Director of Public Prosecutions in making his or her conclusions. He or she should be allowed to resolve appropriate complaints informally, with the complainants' consent, or to resolve complaints formally by assigning penalties and remedies, including a recommendation for disciplinary action, dismissal, changes in policy or procedure or compensation to the complainant.Information that becomes available to the Director of Public Prosecutions that indicates Defence Forces misconduct should be automatically referred to the ombudsman for investigation. Members of the Defence Forces under investigation should be afforded the full protection of due process rights. Both parties should be afforded equal treatment before the law, including full disclosure and access to legal aid if necessary.I am concerned that the Bill's provisions fall short of these standards, particularly in regard to the lack of transparency in the appointments procedure outlined in section 2, the limited scope of functions under section 4, the limitations on investigations under section 5, the non-public nature of investigations under section 9 if the ombudsman wishes to hold a public hearing, and the non-disclosure of documents and prohibition on testimony under section 10.However, I am especially concerned about the time limits for reporting misconduct under section 6, and that there will be no retrospective investigations. These provisions should be removed from the Bill. If they are allowed to stand, there will be no justice for the women whose circumstances were the subject of concern in two reports and whose experiences provided impetus for the creation of the ombudsman. This is unfair. The majority of people in the State want to ensure all Defence Forces misconduct or other unfair treatment should be investigated, regardless of when they happened or when the complaints were lodged.In addition to the cases of the service women who experienced sexual harassment and assault, a number of other outstanding cases have arisen over the years, which should be addressed by the new Defence Forces ombudsman. I refer to the de Róiste case which has caused concern. I have also raised on many occasions the case of a member of the Defence Forces, Michael Donnelly, who was summarily discharged in 1975. He did not even have a right to a court martial and there was no mechanism through which he could vindicate his name. The ombudsman should examine such cases. He or she should not examine minor complaints but should address complaints of bullying, harassment, sexual assault, discrimination, defamation or cases where justice has been denied. I am not an expert in the field, but PDFORRA probably has a list of cases it would like investigated. That is why the time restrictions should be deleted.The crisis in the Air Corps in October resulted from concerns about inadequate safety procedures and equipment in use by the search and rescue service. There was apparent victimisation of members who raised these safety issues and threats of courts martial and demotions were made. When the ombudsman's office is up and running, he or she should be allowed to investigate retrospective cases so that the full truth can be established and the issues involved can be put to rest at the end of the day.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I welcome the introduction of the legislation. Our men and women in uniform have an onerous task and deserve the best pay and conditions. Many are located in Rathmines in my constituency. We are aware of the great sacrifices they must make when they travel abroad, but many pay the ultimate price. There is a volatile situation in Liberia which was pointed out before our soldiers were sent there. However, Sergeant Derek Mooney paid the ultimate price and, on behalf of the Green Party, I express our deepest sympathy to his family. This is another example of the great courage of our soldiers who travel abroad under UN mandates. They are well trained and provide a valuable service.A different standard of behaviour applies within the Army with which few people on "Civvy Street" can identify. This was best exemplified in the Hollywood movie, "A Few Good Men". The US army was portrayed as having a different way of dealing with disciplinary issues. It used the concept of a code red to deal with those who were not up to scratch in terms of training. Unfortunately, this is common practice. As Jack Nicholson famously said: "We do not understand it and we probably never will."  That is how the Army operates.The Bill refers to 24-hour counselling but that will be a strange concept to many soldiers. Will the Minister explain whether there is a need for counselling on a 24-hour basis? Much of the bullying that takes places results from the Army's training regime as it tries to knock people into shape. The Army must change and people's basic human rights must be considered. Bullying cannot be tolerated.The conclusion in the Doyle report was that over 75% of respondents believed the perpetrators could get away with bullying. That is not acceptable to this House. Nobody should be allowed to get away with bullying. There must be a profound change in the way the Army operates. The report also stated that one third of the 250 female personnel surveyed complained of sexual harassment and noted that over 50% of bullying allegations were made concerning activity during training, which seems to be a vital area needing investigation by the ombudsman. I welcome the Minister's intention to examine on Committee Stage amendments recommended by PDFORRA and RACO.In the context of our new duties within Europe, new situations may arise regarding multinational forces. We already have multinational forces within the UN. As we move closer towards a European army – we already have the Rapid Reaction Force – the situation could give rise to new complications where we would have to deal with personnel from other EU countries. Who would be responsible in such cases? Would it be the ombudsman here or the European Ombudsman?The time limits outlined in section 6 are unacceptable. The many women who suffered must have some form of redress. Similarly, we must get answers on the De Róiste case. The issue has gone on far too long and Mr. De Róiste still does not know why he was dismissed from the Army. The continued ignorance of his situation should be resolved quickly. There is no real justice when an issue is allowed to carry on unresolved and an individual is left in the dark about the situation.This is good legislation which is long overdue. While I welcome it, I will propose some amendments on Committee Stage. The Minister will have the support of the Green Party.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The purpose of the Bill is to establish the office of ombudsman for the Defence Forces and to provide for the appointment, functions and staff and to amend the Defence Act 1954. This legislation, when enacted, has the potential to offer members of the Defence Forces a truly independent forum for dealing with complaints and related injustices. No organisation has the capacity to deal effectively with all complaints involving people at different levels within the system. The Defence Forces are no different in this regard.The new office of the ombudsman will provide an independent statutory entity to which complaints can be forwarded in cases where a complainant is not satisfied with the response obtained from military authorities to a formal complaint under the Defence Act provisions for the redress of wrongs. The ombudsman will function as an independent entity and will be provided with clear and precise statutory powers of independent inquiry and investigation closely modelled on those of the original ombudsman legislation of 1980 but reflecting the unique circumstances and demands of the military environment.The current arrangements have provided for recourse to the informal mechanism of an external civilian complaints inquiry officer who can investigate and make recommendations on complaints of an individual nature submitted to the Minister by members of the Defence Forces. Under these arrangements the Minister has the power of discretionary reference of a complaint to the complaints inquiry officer.The issue of bullying and harassment in the Defence Forces has long needed to be tackled. An independent confidential help line and counselling service was launched earlier this year and an independent body will design, administer and analyse an exit interview questionnaire to establish the views of Defence Forces personnel on their experience of military life. The message must go out loud and clear that bullying and harassment will not be tolerated in the Defence Forces.This Bill also provides for the type of complaint that shall not be investigated by the ombudsman, such as where the complainant has initiated legal proceedings or has a statutory right of appeal, reference or review to or before a court, where the action complained of is or has been the subject of investigation under military law or relates to a military operation, or where the complaint relates to terms and conditions of service and all other matters which come within the scope of representation and are appropriate for discussion and negotiation at conciliation and arbitration. This section also provides that the ombudsman shall not investigate a complaint where for security reasons the Minister requests him or her in writing not to investigate such a complaint. The ombudsman may apply to the High Court for a declaration that the matter is not of such gravity as to warrant such a request.It is relevant that we are debating this Bill after the departure of our brave troops to Liberia on their peacekeeping mission. The cause of peace sometimes comes at a price, as the loss of 83 personnel since 1960 shows. However, our Defence Forces have demonstrated over the years that they are made of the right stuff when it comes to facing security risks, particularly in the Lebanon where hundreds of our personnel faced many difficult situations over a 25 year period. When that mission concluded in 2001 it was widely recognised that the Irish handled these situations in a professional manner. I express my sympathy to the family of the late Sergeant Derek Mooney. May he rest in peace.Irish military neutrality is a policy to which this Government is deeply attached. Ireland, however, has never been ideologically neutral or morally indifferent to the major international and security challenges of the day. Ours is not a rigid neutrality frozen in time and isolated from the evolving international security realities. Ireland's neutrality originated as an important expression of sovereignty and became practically possible with the return to Irish control from Britain of the treaty ports in 1938.Irish neutrality has not been imposed from outside, nor is it guaranteed by international treaty. It is a policy espoused by successive Governments and its core defining characteristic is non-membership of military alliances. Our neutrality has gone hand in hand with a strong commitment to international co-operation for stability and peace. There is no conflict between Ireland's military neutrality and full and active support by Ireland for collective security, based on international law.The progressive approach taken by Éamon de Valera in the League of Nations in the 1930s is clear evidence of this. When faced with the challenge to international security of Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, Ireland supported actions and sanctions against Mussolini. The League of Nations was, however, unable to deal effectively with aggressor states led by dictators. This was due to the absence of the United States from the league and the weakness of its enforcement mechanism. By failing to meet its responsibility, the world descended into war. The history of Europe from 1935 to 1945 has shown that military neutrality is not enough to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally. It is also necessary to work actively for international peace and security, taking into account prevailing circumstances.In advocating UN membership to Dáil Éireann in 1946, the former Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera, emphasised his hope that the UN would be better able to act against an aggressor than the League of Nations. He told the House:Either the time for action is going to pass in futile discussion or there must be a method by which effective forcible action will be taken.He later emphasised:If there ever is to be a rule of law, nations must make up their minds that they will take part in such enforcement because if there is not enforcement, then of course the duties and the rights that are guaranteed will be all thrown aside.It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that the safety of all personnel is at the top of the agenda. While one cannot give absolute guarantees regarding safety, we must analyse the risks involved. As well as ensuring that intensive training is undertaken, robust and modern protection assets, including armoured military vehicles and personnel carriers, must be deployed. Our troops deserve the best equipment we can give them.Although 20 countries will be participating in this mission, Ireland is the only western one making a significant contribution. This illustrates the high regard in which the UN holds Ireland and we should be honoured that the unique qualities of the Irish peacekeeper continue to be recognised. Irish peacekeepers are among the most acceptable from the community of troop contributing states for several reasons. These include their high standards of experience and their impartiality, as Ireland is recognised as a neutral country and was never a colonial power. The Defence Forces brings over 40 years of experience to UN peacekeeping. This gives the Irish solider the requirements for peace and support operations. They have a talent for earning the trust and confidence of the conflicting parties and the local population. They have demonstrated their ability to diffuse potentially explosive situations through tact, dialogue and humour.The Congo operation of 1960 marked the first opportunity for the Defence Forces to serve alongside other armies. This experience showed that the Irish troops were as well trained and suited to peacekeeping as any other nationality. Subsequent peacekeeping experience in the Lebanon, Bosnia, Kosovo, East Timor and Cyprus have reinforced this conviction. Speaking on his state visit to Ireland in 1998, President Bill Clinton said:I want to say, because I cannot leave Ireland without acknowledging this, that there are few nations that have contributed more than Ireland, even in times that were difficult for this country, to the cause of peace and human rights around the world.I commend the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002 to the House. It will serve to enhance the position of the Defence Forces as one of the best in the world.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I hope it has a speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.This legislation has been promised for over two years and was part of the Government manifesto. I am pleased it has eventually made its way to the floor of this Chamber. The Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, is delivering on his commitment and my only regret is that it was not delivered prior to the last election.The Defence Forces play an important role in Irish society and their position is guaranteed in our Constitution. Since the foundation of the State, the role and function of the Defence Forces has changed. In the State's infancy, many individuals looked with suspicious eyes at the power and influence which could be wielded by the Army and some of its senior officers. Thankfully, to their eternal credit, the individuals in command of the early Defence Forces took a military role and did not interfere with in politics. This was a bold and brave decision when one takes into account the prevailing political climate across Europe in the 1920s.Up to, and including the time of, the Second World War, the function and role of the Army was carefully monitored by politicians on both sides of the House. The 1960s was an era when new opportunities were afforded to our military personnel. Our participation in the United Nations mission in war-torn Congo was the first of many overseas duties for members of the Defence Forces. It was the start of a long and fruitful relationship with the United Nations. Subsequent to the Congo mission, our Army has taken part in peacekeeping missions in Cyprus, Syria, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia, as part of KFOR and SFOR. Our longest and most identifiable mission was in the Lebanon. Recently, Irish troops have served in East Timor and arrangements are being made to send troops to Liberia. I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy for Sergeant Derek Mooney who was tragically killed in Liberia. I wish our troops serving there a safe mission.This new force being sent to Africa will benefit from the major investment by the Department of Defence in re-equipping our Army. The new Mowag APCs will see active service for the first time in Irish colours. This has meant changes in the structure and operations of our Defence Forces. During the past 12 years, we have also seen the emergence of representative organisations for Army, Naval Service and Air Corps personnel in the form of PDFORRA and RACO. These representative organisations play a meaningful role in the running and organisation of the Defence Forces. PDFORRA has been to the fore in seeking and promoting the establishment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The late John Lucey played a pivotal role in the establishment of PDFORRA and was its forceful general secretary for many years, prior to his untimely death. He was one of the main promoters of the establishment of this office on a statutory basis. It was a source of great encouragement to him when the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, announced that he had received Cabinet approval for the publishing of this Bill. It is tragic that John Lucey did not live to see his idea through to completion. However, it is to his credit that he pursued this goal with such vigour and enthusiasm and that it is now finally being processed into law.In any organisation one has to be mindful of instances of unfair treatment, bullying and discrimination. While, I understand that none of these are major problems within our Defence Forces, it is known that some incidents have taken place. While there is a system in place to deal with such problems, some soldiers have lost confidence in it. It is timely that this Bill is now being debated. The establishment of the ombudsman's office on a statutory basis will give more confidence to individuals who feel they have been mistreated for one reason or another, to seek redress. The Minister for Defence must be complimented for taking on board the Doyle report and acting on its recommendations.In the business and commercial sector, the giving of orders can be perceived as an abuse. An army, however, is different. The passive disciplines, which are accepted in the commercial area, cannot necessarily be applied to a military structure. By its very nature, the Army must have a chain of command and a clearly defined order in which operational duties and functions are carried out. There is concern that the establishment of this office will result in these military structures being diluted or weakened by the inappropriate application of this legislation. While I know that some Members of this House have concerns about some aspects of it, if during this debate areas of weakness are identified the Minister should accept amendments on Committee Stage.The time since Deputy Smith's appointment as Minister for Defence in 1997 has been one of great change in the Department of Defence and in our Defence Forces, with the closure of barracks in 1998 and the huge problem of the Army deafness cases, which represented an abuse in some instances. I commend the Minister on the manner in which he has overseen these particular problems.We could do worse than investigate some aspects of the manner in which some former members of our Defence Forces applied under the Army deafness scheme. I have first-hand knowledge of individuals who were encouraged to take claims against the Department by unscrupulous members of the legal profession. There are companies which should hang their heads in shame for the manner in which they brazenly went after potential claimants in order to ensure they made their claim, even though in their hearts these individuals knew there was little wrong with their hearing. If politicians are seen in a poor light because of the wrongdoings of a minority, the legal profession's reputation has been severely damaged by the selfishness and greed of a small number of its members.It is extraordinary that umbrella organisations are prepared to stand over and defend the actions of some of these cowards. These individuals have effectively put their hands into every taxpayer's pocket. They have effectively mugged the Irish public by taking our money. The €300 million the Government has had to spend in settling some of these deafness claims would have been far better spent on re-equipping the Air Corps, Army and the Defence Forces in general.I welcome this legislation, which is positive for the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence. I commend the Minister for introducing this Bill.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this legislation. As other Members have done, I extend my sympathy to the family of the member of the Defence Forces who lost his life so tragically. He was a young man, as members of the Defence Forces generally are. In so doing, I remember all other members of the Defence Forces who have lost their lives serving abroad or at home over the years. I appreciate their efforts and sacrifices.We rely on the Defence Forces to back up the civil authorities and they have done so admirably since the foundation of the State and will continue to do so. Our Defence Forces are not unique in this and the same applies to many other defence forces. Our Defence Forces now frequently intermingle with the forces of other jurisdictions when serving abroad. It has been beneficial for them to meet and learn from others and I am sure the others have learnt from them also. This is part of the evolution of political and defence developments throughout the world, particularly in Europe. This will become increasingly relevant to the Defence Forces as time goes on.I have probed these issues in the past and will continue to do so in the future. We will need to reconsider as time goes by, particularly in the next six months of Ireland's Presidency of the EU. We need to focus on these issues at every opportunity and recognise that nothing remains the same. Every new dawn brings a new challenge and a change of circumstances. If we are not prepared to change and evolve, we will be left behind in terms of our preparedness.While some people have suggested there is no need for the Defence Forces, I profoundly disagree. In any democracy there will always be a necessity for authorities to back up the civil authorities when and if necessary.In welcoming this legislation, I recognise the Minister is responding to something that has been sought for some time. Along with other members of the Defence Forces, the late Mr. Lucey believed an ombudsman was a necessary ingredient to deal with the issues that arise today and are likely to arise in future. While the culture today requires this, the culture in the past was somewhat different. Various other speakers have referred to this in the course of this debate.The purpose of a military outfit is to toughen the people involved, to make them as aggressive as possible, competent, efficient, accountable and reliable. Without these important qualities, they fail to function as a military group. The degree to which they can depend on each other in all eventualities is critical to their existence, as it is to the existence of the rest of us who rely on them for defence and support. While toughening and the need to promote reliability is important, these can have the effect of pushing people into another area.I believe Deputy Finian McGrath referred to Jack Nicholson. I do not propose to do my impersonation of Jack Nicholson and I am sure that Jack Nicholson would be unimpressed if he heard it.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	389	While I appreciate that, sometimes one goes along with the status quo. One learns over the years – this is borne out when watching that particular film – that because of the nature of the business, it is different from most occupations. It tends to encourage some degree of aggression in the individual. The important element is controlling that and converting it for productive purposes.On a very few occasions in the past that aggression has exceeded the limits, often with tragic results. We have read of intense bullying, intimidation or aggression from within which caused serious problems for some of the people in other defence forces. While it is appalling that this should happen, that is the way it is. We have all heard of instances in the adjoining jurisdiction where extraordinary things happened in recent years, where the parents of teenagers or people in their early 20s had little recourse when their sons or daughters were alleged to have ended their lives. Those circumstances illustrate the necessity of introducing this Bill. The Minister and the military authorities are aware that where an individual feels he or she is assailed and besieged on all sides and has no recourse, things can end tragically. Unfortunately, in some circumstances tragedies have occurred.The ombudsman will provide individuals with the opportunity to have their cases examined in an impartial manner. The complainant will be assured that he or she is being dealt with fairly. That will relieve a great deal of the tension, pressure and fear which people experience. The office of the ombudsman will represent a useful safety valve. Those within the Defence Forces who have grievances will see the issues they raise examined and reviewed. Following the process of review, they will know whether they had just cause for their complaint. The office will be able to separate the frivolous cases from the genuine. If it fails to eliminate frivolous and vexatious complaints, the entire structure will fall into disrepute.The ombudsman will have special relevance to troops serving overseas. Members of the Defence Forces will serve overseas in greater numbers in the future and this type of service will become even more common than it has been. I hope that while serving with other nationalities in the field, soldiers will have recourse to the office of the Defence Forces ombudsman to resolve any difficulties they wish to bring to the attention of the authorities. It can be unnerving for young people in their late and not so late teens to find themselves thrust into circumstances over which they do not have full knowledge. They may not have been in similar situations before. These young men and women are entitled to the best protection and treatment we can provide. They must be secure in the knowledge that they have the support of the institutions of the State when they serve abroad.With colleagues, I have visited soldiers abroad at various locations. We can be justly proud of our troops and the service they have given to the United Nations and the countries to which they have been posted. I have no doubt that they will continue to give the same level of service in the future. It is important to soldiers in foreign locations to know they can rely on the procedures which are available to them at home. If they can be protected by the system from bullying at home, there is no reason they should not be protected abroad. The ombudsman must be able to communicate with his or her counterparts in other defence forces. Where they do not exist, there must be a procedure whereby the ombudsman can take action.We have all had the experience of dealing with the office of an ombudsman regarding social welfare, taxation, house grants and local authorities. I do not refer queries in that direction any longer as it takes a great deal of time to resolve a problem. These delays have been the result of staff shortages. I hope in the case of the military ombudsman that procedures exist which can be put into operation quickly and effectively. Parties to any complaint must have cases processed speedily. This is not to imply that cases should be dealt with abruptly but rather that they should be considered efficiently and effectively. Putting such procedures in place will greatly enhance the effectiveness of the office of the ombudsman.Many Members have referred to bullying and, in some cases, unwanted sexual attention. These behaviours can arise in all walks of life. There has been a great deal of debate on this issue over the years. We must be clinical and insist that where it is made clear that attention of a sexual nature is unwanted, that should be the end of it. There should be no continued aggression, pursuit, bullying or intimidation. It has been suggested that superiors in various organisations outside the Defence Forces are in a position to take advantage of certain circumstances. I acknowledge that everybody is human, but this behaviour does not occur in the Defence Forces and it should never start. It cannot be allowed to occur because the morale of everybody involved is at stake. If a situation develops and a male or female is made to feel that they are at a disadvantage and under threat from peers or superiors, a serious problem will have arisen. The office of the ombudsman will reassure people in the unlikely event that behaviour of the sort I have outlined occurs.The ombudsman's procedures should not interfere with other procedures. If one refers a tax or social welfare issue to an ombudsman, no other movement in respect of it may occur. As my colleague from south Kildare knows, a case may rest with an ombudsman for a year and a half or more. That would be a long time to have to wait for a dispute to be resolved. I am not too clear about what the scale of the intervention will be. What will be its schedule and timeframe in this case? Will the work of the ombudsman run concurrently with, for example, a potential court martial? Will a complaint made to the ombudsman be investigated first? I presume that a court or a court martial will be available in any event, regardless of whether the issue is brought before the ombudsman. Perhaps this matter should be teased out so that the normal sequence of events on either side is not impeded. It is something that the Minister might bear in mind. Perhaps he will refer to it in his reply as it is important to reassure those involved.The last point I would like to make is—

There should be a system of separating serious complaints from other complaints.

All Members who spoke to support the motion referred to the inherent dangers involved in the mission, which is regarded by most people as possibly the most high-risk endeavour undertaken by the Defence Forces since their engagement in the Congo.It was with great regret, therefore, that I noted the death of a member of the Army, Sergeant Derek Mooney, who was a member of the elite ranger wing. He died as a result of a motor accident 40 km south-east of Monrovia. It was an especially cruel twist of fate that this brave young man lost his life while he was working to set up a base camp for the rest of the Irish contingent, some of whom have arrived in Liberia which is still quite unstable. I join the expressions of sympathy to his parents, his fiancée, his family and his colleagues in the Defence Forces. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.It is also appropriate that I should extend good wishes for a speedy recovery to Sergeant Seán Baldwin of Newbridge, County Kildare, who was seriously injured in the same accident. Our thoughts are with him and his family at this difficult time.It would be remiss of me, during a debate on an important Defence Forces issue in the immediate aftermath of the budget not to refer to the Government's decision to decentralise the headquarters of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence to County Kildare.

It comes at the end of a period of sustained investment by the Government in the Curragh Camp. The fact that the camp had been starved of cash was obvious to anyone who drove through it in the 1970s or 1980s. I am certain that the decentralisation initiative will be welcomed by Defence Forces personnel, who appreciate the unique nature of the Curragh Camp and will benefit from consolidation of investment there.Tá áthas orm an seans seo a fháil labhairt ar an mBille. I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute briefly to the debate on the Bill. Although the legislation has been in gestation for a long time, as other speakers have pointed out, it has received a welcome from all interested parties. I wish to be associated with the remarks of many Members, including the Minister, who referred to the work of the late Mr. John Lucey, who campaigned tirelessly for an ombudsman to be appointed. I did not know Mr. Lucey personally, but I met him on one occasion, the famous day in 1998 when Magee Barracks in Kildare closed for the last time. I am aware that he did stalwart work on behalf of the Defence Forces and the representative body, PDFORRA. It is appropriate that consultation on this legislative proposal has continued. I note that the Minister said he will accept amendments on Committee Stage that reflect the concerns raised by PDFORRA and RACO.The purpose of the Bill is to establish an office of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces, to provide for the appointment, functions and staff of the ombudsman and to amend the Defence Act 1954. When this legislation has been enacted, it will have the potential to offer members of the Defence Forces a truly independent forum for dealing with complaints and injustices that can emerge. As other speakers have said, no organisation has the capacity to deal effectively with all types of complaints involving people at different levels of it. The Defence Forces is no different in this regard.The present arrangements provide for recourse to the informal mechanism of an external civilian complaints inquiry officer who can investigate and make recommendations on individual complaints which are submitted to the Minister by members of the Defence Forces. Under the arrangements, the Minister has the power of discretionary reference of a complaint to the complaints inquiry officer. A review of this process carried out near the end of 1999 indicated that the officer was dealing with between 20 and 25 cases per annum. It was found that a particular demand existed at private and non-commissioned officer level. The process used was independent of the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and the then Minister.The new office of the ombudsman will be an independent statutory entity to which complaints can be forwarded in cases where complainants are not satisfied with the responses obtained from the military authorities to formal complaints under the Defence Act provisions for the redress of wrongs. The new office of the ombudsman will function as an entirely independent entity. It will have clear statutory powers of independent inquiry and investigation, closely modelled on those in the Ombudsman Act 1980. The powers of the new office will, however, reflect the unique circumstances and demands of the military environment. We must accept that the military environment is different from any other working environment.We can see from the Liberian mission and many other missions undertaken in the past that society expects members of the Defence Forces to be ready to take major risks on our behalf and to lay their lives on the line, if necessary. They must undergo tough and robust training to take on this challenge successfully. They must be amenable and responsive to a strong chain of command. This does not mean, however, that they should be subjected to ridicule, verbal abuse, or harassment of any sort. Good military management should have regard to the dignity of each member of the Defence Forces. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case. The former Army captain, Dr. Tom Clonan, publicly exposed the issue of sexual discrimination and harassment of women soldiers.It is to the credit of the Minister and the Chief of Staff of the Army that they moved swiftly to appoint Dr. Eileen Doyle to examine and report on these problems. We can see the justification for the provisions of the Bill when we consider that Dr. Doyle found that more than 30% of the soldiers who were surveyed had some difficulties as a result of harassment, bullying and discrimination. The Minister and the chief of staff have attempted to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of harassment or intimidation by establishing an independent and confidential helpline and counselling service. By enacting the Bill, the House will send a loud and clear message that bullying and harassment will not be tolerated in the Defence Forces.It should be acknowledged that, by establishing an equality steering group to audit Defence Forces regulations and practices, the military authorities are beginning a process which should lead to greater participation by women in the Defence Forces, which is at a disappointingly low level of less than 5%.I welcome the fact that the Bill is clear in setting out the type of complaint that shall not be investigated by the ombudsman, including areas considered inappropriate by the Minister for security reasons. It is equally important that, in such circumstances, the ombudsman may have recourse to the High Court. However, notwithstanding the difficulties which are being addressed in an honest and open way, it must be acknowledged that morale in Defence Forces is high and that members record a high level of job satisfaction. The Bill before us is one more initiative in building a secure and bright future for our Defence Forces, and I am happy to commend it to the House.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The last few weeks have been of major significance to the Defence Forces. They saw our first movement of troops to Liberia and, as an unfortunate result, the sad loss of Sergeant Derek Mooney. On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to express my deepest sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues of Sergeant Mooney, the Minister and the chief of staff. It is obviously of major significance that such an occurrence should happen so early in a contingent's involvement in a foreign country. In the case of Liberia, there is such grave concern regarding members of our armed forces that it obviously set alarm bells ringing for families right across the country who had loved ones out there.The Minister knows that great responsibility is thrust on him when he comes to the House to propose such a decision, and on the rest of us when we support it. It may be only for the day that we are really concerned at what has happened. Suddenly we see what has happened to Sergeant Mooney and other members of the Defence Forces in this regard. One can see how major the decision is and the degree of concern surrounding it. The House has made many decisions in that regard over the years since the first troops went to the Congo in 1960. One can see the responsibility of various Ministers for Defence, the decisions of the House to support the Minister for Defence down the years and the benefit reflected in our Defence Forces.Down the years our Defence Forces have justly and proudly carried out their duties in many parts of the world. They have had major influence on the portrayal of Ireland as a peacekeeping nation of which each and every one of us can be proud. In latter years, many Members of this House have visited areas where Irish peacekeeping forces have been involved. One can, from contact and conversation with our counterparts in those countries, as well as ordinary people, see the benefit they derived from the involvement of Irish forces. It is to be welcomed that the decision has been made, however sad it may be that, in the early stages, we have suffered the loss of Sergeant Derek Mooney and that other members of our forces have been injured.In the last few weeks, there have been significant changes regarding the Defence Forces, specifically, as Deputy Ó Fearghaíl has said, regarding our own constituency in south Kildare. Deputies Ó Fearghaíl, Power and I have welcomed the budget decision to relocate several Departments, particularly the Department of Defence to Newbridge and Army headquarters to the Curragh. One can see a great deal of logic in relocating Army headquarters to the Curragh, because it has always been the central focus of the Defence Forces. One can see what has happened in latter years regarding the major investment to upgrade many of the buildings. In some cases, this has involved demolishing and rebuilding them. That has had an effect on the local economy in terms of employment, material acquisition and the overall context of upgrading the Curragh. I welcome that fact. As a former spokesman on defence, I have had many debates with the Minister on that issue. There was satisfaction that the work was being done and being moved forward. There is still work to be done on infrastructure to facilitate the change.For some time my sole concern has been the residential quarters at the Curragh which are in very poor repair. This issue has been the subject of debates in the House and questions have been asked of the Minister. I do not know what plans the Department of Defence has in that regard, whether it intends to change the Curragh to a completely military base or examine current residential quarters to see if they might be upgraded. Upgrading them may not be viable owing to their condition, yet members of the Defence Forces are living in married quarters. We will have to examine the decision to move the headquarters to the Curragh and the effect that will have on the general area. There will be a need to consider the residential aspect of such a decision to move several hundred jobs and its impact on the general Curragh and Newbridge area. However, it is the right decision and I welcome it.Having this opportunity to speak on this important legislation, one remembers the efforts of the late John Lucey to ensure that the Minister brought it before the House. The Bill was sought at successive annual conferences by both representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO. In the debates that took place at the conferences between the Minister and the late John Lucey, this matter was always high on the agenda. In fairness to the Minister, he took on board the fact that the legislation was necessary. I do not remember any conference at which he stated the legislation was not necessary, but rather he pointed out it was a matter of time before it was introduced.It is important to recognise the effort and time put into this legislation. I know from speaking to PDFORRA and RACO representatives that they welcome the fact that it is now approaching legislative form. It will be of major benefit to the Defence Forces, regardless of which section one is a member. The basis of the legislation is a desire on the part of PDFORRA and RACO for such a mechanism. That situation was created through the case histories brought to the associations over the years. Working within their remit as representative bodies, they were not in a position to deal with them. Had they attempted to use the mechanism that was there, they would have found it very cumbersome. That was the reason they prioritised this issue in their representations.The workings of the present office of Ombudsman have received widespread acclaim and, as one who uses the office frequently, I thank the office for its staff's courtesy and efficiency over the years. One can only assume that the incoming ombudsman for the Defence Forces will have the same courtesy and efficiency in regard to Defence Force members. The investigative approach the current office has used has been effective.The time taken between a complaint being made and when it is addressed is important. It is important that, when a complaint is made to the ombudsman's office, it is dealt with quickly because such complaints usually involve tension and have major implications for complainants because they will have used up every other mechanism, including their associations, and are fraught with anxiety and concern.I am sure the Minister and the parliamentary counsel have, in the preparation of the Bill, used the experience garnered over the years by the Ombudsman. At present, when a complaint is made to the Ombudsman's office, a reply is given out immediately and there is constant contact with him or her and it is important this mechanism continues. Upon reading the Bill, one can see a relationship between it and the legislation used to establish the current Ombudsman.Section 5 provides that even in cases involving secrecy, the ombudsman may take a case to the High Court to determine that a decision of the Minister is reflected in the decision not to permit the ombudsman to investigate it. That type of mechanism is important to representative associations in their annual general meetings and so on, in order that they can explain to members that the legislation is in favour of the complainant and the law is supportive of them in regard to their complaint, regardless of the Minister's actions in support of laws governing the Defence Forces.I welcome the Bill. It was imperative that we recognised the Defence Forces representative associations. It is the Minister's recognition of their efforts at annual conference level which has put this provision in place. Other Deputies have referred to the need for the Bill in regard to bullying and sexual harassment, which aspects must be addressed. The mechanism has now been put in place to ensure that can happen. The Minister has the full support of the Labour Party in passing the Bill and I hope it will reach its conclusion as quickly as possible. I also hope that when it is on the Statute Book, the efforts of the various associations will be recognised, together with that of the Minister and his officials. The Bill was negotiated through a number of conferences to reach today's stage and I welcome it.

Having read Deputy McGinley's speech, I am fully conversant with the issues and their importance.The Irish Army is significantly different to many other armies in that ours is primarily a peacekeeping force, which does not cause offence or take over countries. The role the Army has taken is a special one which has been recognised internationally in the number of times Irish troops have been asked to serve in peacekeeping forces. That they have done so efficiently and effectively is a credit to all those in the Army and augurs well for the new situation in Liberia where the Army is about to be deployed. The second group of soldiers to travel there is from Dundalk Barracks, and I have heard they are looking forward to the challenge and are equipped in the best and most modern manner. I am sure they will be an effective and efficient peacekeeping force there.At the age of 16, I was lucky enough to have been able to join the FCA, although that is no longer allowed. A man from Drogheda and I were outside the billet in uniform, having finished our day's work, playing a game of splits in which a knife is thrown and the first person to fall is the loser. A strict sergeant picked up the knife, told us it was not allowed under regulations because it was a quarter of an inch too long and we were marched off by a corporal to the commandant in Gormanston. However, the commandant was Mr. Peter Sands, who is the director of elections for Fianna Fáil in Louth, and he had a word in the ear of the sergeant and told us to go off and enjoy ourselves. The commandant was our ombudsman on that occasion.People can go to extremes in the Army when they get a little bit of power with their sergeant's stripes. It was a funny and silly occasion because it showed how much someone had grown too big for their boots and how wise Mr. Peter Sands handled the issue.

As other Deputies have said, difficult situations arise and people can be deeply wronged by others who make a decision on the field in the heat of battle, which cannot be easily resolved under present circumstances. An individual could go many years under a slight wrongly put on them by someone who made a poor decision and blamed the individual for it.It is important that this Bill should be enacted and the ombudsman appointed. It is also important for clarity and transparency of decision-making that the person appointed is apart from the regular Army. The person chosen to fill the position will be obliged to have broad knowledge of life in the Defence Forces. That should be one of the major criteria used because the person must be able to understand the type of situations that will arise. Soldiers who feel aggrieved will welcome the fact that a proper appeals process, separate from the command structure, will be in place and will be transparent, open and fair. That is the essence of the Bill.The role of the ombudsman will be similar to that of ombudsmen in other jurisdictions. Deputy McGinley outlined the position in Canada and other European countries and the different roles played by ombudsmen in these places. If a serving soldier knows that his rights will be protected, above and beyond his natural expectation of fairness and fair play within his unit, that is good and proper.I was previously employed as a teacher and I worked with many young people for whom careers in the Army were always attractive. The Air Corps, which was based at Gormanston, was chosen by many people from Drogheda and Dundalk because they could serve and live locally. There is a tremendous tradition of military service and commitment in Drogheda. Another politician with military connections in the town is the former Deputy, Michael Bell, who served as a lieutenant there for many years. Drogheda has many connections with the Defence Forces, particularly the FCA. The Army taught us all some of the organisational—

That was slightly less than we would have expected. Be that as it may, Michael Bell has again entered the fray in Drogheda politics. This is an important and useful Bill and those in the Defence Forces will benefit greatly from it.Beidh mé ag caint as Gaeilge go ceann bomaite.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. This is the first occasion on which I have been able to contribute on a Bill that is being steered through the Dáil by my fellow countyman, the Minister, Deputy Smith. It would be remiss of me if I did not compliment the Deputy on the job he is doing in his capacity as Minister with responsibility for the Defence Forces. We always watch with pride when he inspects guards of honour, be they at home or in some other jurisdiction. Wherever the Minister goes, he does an excellent job and takes his work seriously. Many of his duties involve supporting the Army in its peacekeeping role in troublespots throughout the world. It is a proud job for anyone to be obliged to do, particularly in light of the reputation the members of the Army have built up as excellent keepers of the peace.I recall, as a young man in Tipperary, when members of the Army went to the Congo on peacekeeping duties. A young man who played hurling for the local parish and as a minor for Tipperary was one of those to go. There was a great deal of sadness when he left. However, there was also much joy and I remember his visit to our school when he explained what he would be doing out there. I was extremely impressed by the man whose name was Seán Warren. The Minister will recall that Seán, who was a fine looking and articulate man, died of cancer at a young age. I have no doubt that he would have reached the very highest ranks in the Army had he lived.The Army does great work, of which it can be proud, but many ordinary people do not understand the nature of it. The Army authorities should consider sending representatives into the schools to explain to members of the younger generation the role played by soldiers and the excellent work they do worldwide. It is a pity that such visits do not occur at present because they would provide young people with living examples of those who have travelled to other parts of the world to keep the peace. These visits, and the example of those involved in peacekeeping, would engender in young people respect for law and order. Last week representatives of my county council visited the schools in the locality and handed out prizes for tidy schools and a clean environment. The presentation and the remarks made by the chairman of the council and his officials will make a lasting impression. The Army should consider doing something similar in our schools.There is an Army barracks situated in Clonmel in my constituency. It would be remiss of me not to mention the esteem in which the Army is held in south Tipperary. People were concerned some years ago that the barracks would be closed down and I am delighted that it has remained open. I hope it will remain in place for many years. The barracks is a great source of employment for people in the town. The Army was first to offer help during the flooding in Clonmel. It has always stepped in when needed. Some years ago it became involved when the local petrol stations went on strike.People should have pride in the Army and I am delighted that the Bill has been introduced. This is the fourth ombudsman's office to be established since the foundation of the State. The Ombudsman Act 1980 established the first such office. The pensions ombudsman was appointed under Part 3 of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002, while the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is covered by the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002.It is interesting to compare the powers, responsibilities and limitations of each office. The Cabinet has less power over the Ombudsman than it will have over the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman. The President appoints the Ombudsman on the recommendation of a concurrent resolution of the Dáil and Seanad and not on the recommendation of Government, as will be the case with the Defence Forces ombudsman. The Ombudsman Act 1980, not a Minister, fixes the retirement age and compensation of the Ombudsman. He or she, apart from resigning on reaching retirement age, may be removed from office by the President in cases of misbehaviour, incapacity or bankruptcy if so recommended by the Dáil or Seanad. The Defence Forces ombudsman can be removed if a decision is made by the Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas. The vital difference between the two offices is that the President is omitted from consultation about the Defence Forces ombudsman. Otherwise, the Ombudsman is similar to the Defence Forces ombudsman in the manner in which he or she carries out investigations.The Ombudsman Act 1980 does not contain the same accountability provisions, including requirements and provisions for appearing before committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas, contained in this Bill. The Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 established the position of Ombudsman for Children. The President appoints him or her on the nomination of the Dáil and Seanad. The term of office is set at six years and the retirement age is fixed at 67. The President can remove the Ombudsman for Children for due causes, with prior approval of the Dáil or Seanad, provided they are among those laid down in the Statute. As in the case of the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman and the pensions Ombudsman, the relevant Minister, in this case the Minister for Health and Children, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determines compensation.The Bills establishing the three previous ombudsman positions set the retirement age at 67 years. By contrast, the retirement age for the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman may, under the Bill, be set by the Minister for Defence. Why is that?We must compare the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman to those established in other western democracies like Canada, the United States and other European countries. The mandate and powers of the ombudsman for the Canadian defence forces are laid down in departmental and administrative orders and directives. These are to act as a sounding board and mediator within the Canadian Department of National Defence and the Canadian defence forces, to provide information and referral for existing methods of redress within the Canadian defence forces and to assist in making long-term improvements in the welfare of employees and members of the that force.There are numerous differences between how the Canadian ombudsman and the proposed ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate complaints. Whereas the latter may investigate specific cases where the normal means of dispute-resolution fails to satisfy the complainant, the former investigates complaints to review the existing process for handling complaints to ensure it is fair.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Before I comment on its detail, I would like to thank and commend our Defence Forces for their excellent work at home and abroad and, in particular, their work with the United Nations peacekeeping missions. Many have paid the ultimate price for the cause of international peace. It is important we recognise their bravery, integrity and professionalism. I thank them and their families for their efforts.The purpose of the Bill is to establish the office of ombudsman for the Defence Forces, to provide for the appointment, functions and staff of that office and to amend the Defence Act 1954. I welcome this as an attempt to ensure equality, fairness and justice in our Defence Forces. I will come back to this issue later in the debate.Section 2 provides for the establishment of the office of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces and for the appointment by the President, on the recommendation of the Government, of the ombudsman. This section also provides that the ombudsman should hold office on such terms and conditions as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may determine and specifies those not eligible to fill the appointment. The section also prescribes how the office may be vacated and provides that the retirement age will be as prescribed by regulations.I welcome section 4, which provides for the functions of the ombudsman and sets out the nature of the complaints that may be investigated by him or her when it appears that the complaint is not likely to be resolved by the military authorities by way of the redress procedures prescribed in the Defence Act 1954. It also provides the circumstances in which the ombudsman may not carry out or discontinue an investigation. Having regard to the fact that the Department of Defence is already within the remit of the Ombudsman appointed under the Ombudsman Act 1980, while the Defence Forces are not, this section also provides that a complaint may be made either to the Ombudsman appointed under the Ombudsman Act 1980 or the ombudsman appointed under this legislation about an administrative action taken by a civil servant in the Department of Defence, but that it may not subsequently be made to the other ombudsman.On first reading the Bill, I immediately thought of the late, great Captain James Kelly who served his country with honour, bravery and integrity even though elements in political and military circles destroyed his career. This is particularly relevant to section 5(1), which sets out the provisions for dealing with an action complained of that has been or is the subject of investigation under military law or relates to a military action. In this regard, I ask if the late Captain James Kelly would have been dismissed or have suffered so much if this legislation had been in place back then? It is essential we face up to this reality in this debate. I deplore the actions of successive Governments and Ministers in this regard. Why did successive Governments hide or run from the truth?At the funeral of Captain Kelly, Tim Pat Coogan referred to him as the Irish Dreyfus, an apt analogy. Both army officers were sacrificed by their respective states and by unprincipled politicians. Captain Dreyfus was vindicated after a few years, was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was honoured by the French state. However, Captain Kelly spent 30 years struggling to vindicate his name. After his acquittal at the Arms Trial in 1970, he was denied his Army pension for a period by the Lynch Administration. The future looked bleak for an unemployed Army officer, but he was ably and loyally supported by his wife, Sheila, and family.Captain Kelly was a gutsy individual who was not prepared to suffer victimhood, so he fought back. Most of his contemporaries in the Army accept he would have reached the upper echelons of his service had not politicians destroyed his career. States can easily crush individuals but they did not succeed with Captain Kelly because he fought back in every forum and won. I say won, because the legalistic pronouncements of the State, both before and after his death, may not have been as explicit as he deserved. Nevertheless, most citizens believe a great wrong was done to him, somewhat like the story of Robert Emmet, written about by detached historians as a failure, but in the minds of the people a great patriot. With his irrepressible energy, honesty and integrity, Captain Kelly was not only a beacon for Northern Nationalists, he was a beacon for all Irish people. In debating this Bill dealing with the appointment of an ombudsman for the Defence Forces, I could not miss the opportunity to refer to the great miscarriage of justice involving the late Captain Kelly.Sections 11 and 12 are standard provisions relating to the accountability of the office of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces to the Committee of Public Accounts and others. This is in line with similar provisions in legislation governing other independent offices.I support these sections as I always welcome and support the idea of accountability of all pubic servants, especially in our Defence Forces.Sections 14 to 16 contain standard provisions relating to the office, staff, investigation officers, the keeping of proper accounts and their submission to the Comptroller and Auditor General. These provisions are in line with similar provisions covering other independent offices. These are old and valuable principles and we should never ignore the need for keeping proper accounts, especially where taxpayers money is concerned. It is essential that we do not lose sight of these goals, especially in light of the ongoing tribunals.I wish to raise the issue of the role of the Defence Forces. As this is in the public eye, it is essential that we reflect on the direction this country is taking. I have no problems with peacekeeping and I welcome our intervention in Liberia. While this mission is positive, it is also risky. However, I have major problems with elements in society that want to take our Defence Forces and defence policies in another direction. I am talking about people that hold negative attitudes to the UN and seem to have a positive attitude to groups like NATO.I have major problems with NATO and other nuclear clubs. Let us call a spade a spade – nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction. I do not want to see Ireland becoming involved with groups that hold nuclear weapons. It is essential that we tell large countries like America and Britain to get off the high moral ground regarding their presence in Iraq and the question of weapons of mass destruction. It is a pity that the governments of those countries did not get the message when more than 200,000 recently marched in London and nearly 100,000 marched in Dublin before the war.What is happening in Shannon Airport is a disgrace. The Government's silence on it is out of order and I challenge the Minister for Foreign Affairs on it. He appears to be keeping his head in the sand so that he does not upset certain people in America. He is compromising our neutrality and our allegiance to the UN. Ireland should be trying to prevent wars and should not tip its cap to the US and Britain. While it is a question of integrity for our Defence Forces, it is also a question of public safety. It is a sad day for this country when a civilian airport is used for military purposes. This can cause a risk to the safety of all our people, but especially those in Clare and Limerick.People often talk about public safety. I find it amazing that they do not refer to the landing and taking off at Shannon Airport of cargo aeroplanes under military control. These craft, which are laden with weapons, take refuelling stops at Shannon. I am speaking of weapons like the 28 patriot missiles carried in one aeroplane. Each of these missiles contains 44 kg of high explosives and 498 kg of rocket fuel. Substantial quantities of mark 77 airdrop incendiary bombs have been shipped through Shannon. There have been overflights of US aeroplanes, each carrying more than 40 cruise missiles across the Irish countryside. An unknown amount of bombs, explosives and munitions have carried through Ireland under US military control during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Much of this is in breach of Irish law.There have been at least two emergencies involving military aeroplanes this year. An aeroplane carrying 221 soldiers experienced engine failure while a cargo aeroplane suffered a fire onboard. In both cases, access was denied to Irish authorities. These are potential accidents that could cause untold damage. Between January and September 2003, 92,617 American soldiers passed through Shannon Airport. I raise these issues in the interests of public safety and in terms of the foreign policy of this State.It is important that I highlight what is happening here regarding our Defence Forces. I am reminded of the many cases where our troops have made valuable contributions, such as in Lebanon. Irish troops had a fantastic record of working with local communities and on peacekeeping missions. This is the direction in which our defence forces go.I welcome the Bill and believe an ombudsman is urgently needed for our Defence Forces to ensure we have equality, fairness and justice. The position must be filled by someone with experience and integrity. Earlier, we discussed the valuable role the Army has played in UN peacekeeping. The Liberia mission, in which the Defence Forces are serving, is a dangerous one and we must be conscious of the risks. The Liberian conflict is political, with the use of drugs and child soldiers mixed through it. I have supported the intervention as I feel it is the correct thing to do. The way forward for our Defence Forces must always be through the UN. I hope the Minister ensures that our troops are given the maximum political and moral support, that they have professional support and are properly equipped to deal with this mission.Irish troops have always been respected and seen as impartial and this should be a valuable weapon in this conflict. The record of the Defence Forces is one of professionalism and human rights. We all know their background in building positive relationships with local communities in different countries throughout the world. I recently visited Colombia as an observer at the trial of three Irish citizens and saw an army that was negatively involved with the local community, especially the poor. I was shocked to hear from lawyers, human rights groups and members of the Red Cross of the role of the army in the Colombian conflict. Many members of the army are linked to right-wing death squads and have killed many people and destroyed many villages. I cite this because it is not the kind of army I want to see being brought about here. We do not have such an army and I commend our forces for always retaining professionalism, impartiality and respect for human rights and dignity. Our track record in this, ranging from our involvement in the Congo to Lebanon and now in Liberia, is excellent.It is essential that, when the position of ombudsman is filled, all soldiers within the Defence Forces are treated with equality and respect. We have a number of problems within the forces and these must be dealt with professionally. I have already raised the issues of bullying and sexual harassment and these must be taken seriously. I am confident that the person appointed to this position will take on board the views of the members of the Defence Forces.This is a progressive and valuable Bill and I will support it.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. It has been welcomed by most speakers and, I am sure, will be welcomed by members of the Defence Forces. The Bill was published in January 2002 and provides for the establishment of an office of the ombudsman for the Defence Forces and that the holder will be independent in the performance of his functions.The only connection my parish has with the Defence Forces is in the shape of Peadar Clancy who was a member of the organisation in the early years of the State. Clancy Barracks in Dublin was named after him and is due to be sold. There is a bust of Peadar Clancy in my native Kildysert and the people of the area are proud of the contribution he made to the Army. While I regret that that barracks are up for sale, I hope the funds derived from the sale will provide for the upgrading of other barracks for the Defence Forces. This will allow them to have comfortable surroundings.The ombudsman will be appointed by the President, who is the supreme commander of the Defence Forces, on the recommendation of the Government. The Defence Forces consist of the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps, all of which have an important role. The role of the Defence Forces, as set out by the Government, is to defend the State and aid the Garda Síochána when requested. We are all familiar with the convoys of jeeps that escort the Garda squad cars and the cash transit vehicles.The most important role the Defence Forces now play is in international peacekeeping missions for the United Nations. They serve in various countries in Africa and the Far East. They also provide a fishery protection service. They engage in search and rescue missions, run an air ambulance service and are involved in Government travel. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, has travelled with them on many occasions in his role as Minister for Defence.The role of the Defence Forces has changed very much in recent times, as has society. It is important that we have modern Defence Forces capable of dealing with modern warfare. This morning on Sky News I heard that the British Defence Forces claim they too must change to meet modern warfare needs. Therefore, the issue under discussion is topical.I note that four ombudsman offices deal with various complaints from the public. The first Ombudsman was Michael Mills, whose office was established in the 1980s. It is important that there be an independent system of appeal in respect of complaints, whether they pertain to the State or bodies under its aegis. It is only right that our Defence Forces would have an independent ombudsman to deal with the various problems that arise. It is only in recent times that the Defence Forces were granted their own representative bodies, PDFORRA and RACO. We all remember the late John Lucey, the former general secretary of PDFORRA, and the excellent work he did on behalf of his members. He campaigned vigorously for the establishment of an office of a Defence Forces ombudsman and it is fitting that this position will now be created as a result of his tireless work.People will have complaints in any institution. As various Members have stated, complaints in the Defence Forces include harassment, including sexual harassment, and bullying. Although a complaints procedure was available to members of the Defence Forces under section 114 of the Defence Act 1954, it was a case of policemen investigating each other and was not acceptable. The introduction of a Defence Forces ombudsman will remove any bias and make the system fairer for the members involved.The Doyle report in 2002 examined the complaints of many members of the Defence Forces and, interestingly, found that 20% to 30% of the soldiers interviewed had grievances, many of which were significant. The report was useful and helped prepare the way for the Defence Forces ombudsman.I note from the Bill that the ombudsman will be provided with staff, including investigation officers. I hope the cutbacks in the Civil Service announced last year by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will not affect the staffing of the ombudsman's office and that the necessary finance will be made available for this purpose and for the purchase of equipment.I welcome certain provisions in the Bill that are in line with similar provisions in legislation governing other independent offices. These include a provision for a superannuation scheme for the ombudsman and accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts. Deputy Perry, who will speak on the Bill shortly, will note that. The ombudsman will also be accountable to other Oireachtas committees.I understand the ombudsman system has worked well in other countries. I believe I was present in the Chamber on 25 November last when Deputy McGinley referred to successful ombudsman systems in various countries, such as Canada and Australia. I hope that former members of the Defence Forces will be able to use the ombudsman's office to address problems they have had. Through my constituency work, I have been in touch with the Minister regarding ex-Army officers from the 1940s and 1950s who still have some grievances. He did his best to investigate these matters for me.I wish the troops well who are setting up camps in Liberia, including the Army rangers. I hope they have a safe peacekeeping mission. Like other speakers, I sympathise with the family of Sergeant Derek Mooney who was killed recently in a road accident in Liberia. I welcome the Bill and hope it has a speedy transition through the House.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na cainteoirí uile, ní amháin um thráthnóna ach ar an lá deireanach, a chabhraigh leis an mBille agus, go h-áirithe, iadsan a thacaíonn na Fórsaí Cosanta agus a misiúin ar fud an domhain.I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate, especially for their messages of condolence to Sergeant Derek Mooney's fiancée and family, for their good wishes to Seán Baldwin and for their unquestionable support of the Defence Forces in their work at home and especially on foreign missions, including the present mission to Liberia.I indicated in my opening remarks that I propose to table a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. These will represent a positive response to certain concerns raised with me by PDFORRA after its reflection on the published Bill. The House can be assured that any amendments proposed that are fundamentally consistent with the general spirit and objectives of the Bill will be examined fairly and objectively and in a positive frame of mind.The Bill seeks to build upon the practical experience gained from the operation of the informal complaints inquiry officer mechanism from 1996. Specifically, I have sought to address directly the perceived shortcomings within that system from the viewpoint of Defence Forces personnel. The Bill was drafted as a direct and positive response to these legitimate views.The political commitment I made to introduce an independent ombudsman for the Defence Forces arose from the convincing and passionate advocacy of the case for a new statutory Defence Forces ombudsman made by the late John Lucey, the then general secretary of PDFORRA. Many Deputies have paid tribute to him. In effect, this legislation can be viewed as a worthy posthumous tribute to John Lucey's tireless and dedicated campaign for the provision of an independent Defence Forces ombudsman.This legislation will in time come to be seen as an entirely new point of departure for redress procedures within the Defence Forces. It is difficult nowadays to argue against the concept of providing access for appeal to an independent authority with clear statutory powers of investigation in cases where a complainant remains dissatisfied with the official response to a complaint. The existence of other ombudsman positions within the statutory public realm challenges the lack of provision of comparable statutory arrangements for the Defence Forces. There are parameters of common sense within which such a provision must work. The occupational environment of the Defence Forces is unique and this must be reflected realistically in the legislation if we are to produce a mechanism which will work.One consistent theme in all contributions was the Doyle report. A significant number of improvements have been put in place, as have a raft of effective mechanisms to guarantee improved circumstances. These include a 24-hour confidential helpline which has already been established and a range of measures designed to ensure the victim has a number of options which will encourage him or her to seek help. Other measures being put in place include a new policy on interpersonal relations which includes formal and informal mechanisms for dealing with complaints.As this report was referred to on so many occasions, it is only proper for me as Minister for Defence to say that this was an exhaustive, comprehensive and searching analysis of all aspects of discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment. Ours is one of the organisations of significant size which has undertaken this exhaustive work and I am satisfied we have taken steps other organisations could benefit from in facing up to these realities. We have had a positive response at all levels as we try to ensure, as Deputies requested, that these problems are consigned to the past.Regarding Deputy Hayes's suggestions, some years ago we began reviewing troops away from barracks before they went abroad and we have been to Roscrea, Templemore, Roscrea, Cavan and other places. This gave the public fantastic exposure not just to the demonstrative effect of what was happening on the day but to opportunities for recruitment, showing our wares and generally making the public aware of the Defence Forces. There is greater awareness now but there is always more we can do. The Army bands have approximately 400 engagements during the year, for example, many of which are in first and second level schools. I will take Deputy Hayes's suggestion on board because there are always other ways for us to improve what we do.Deputy Gormley asked about our missions around the world. Any future situations requiring an ombudsman, a complaints officer or the involvement of the Defence Forces hierarchy will be dealt with by our Army. Complaints made anywhere will be dealt with in the same way.I am glad we have been able to move the Bill on to Committee Stage. There are suggestions that we may be able to take Committee Stage in the middle of January and I look forward to bringing amendments we are contemplating forward at that stage, as well as dealing as sympathetically as I can with the recommendations of other Deputies.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	420	My party colleagues have addressed the broad implications of the budget for 2004 and I will make some general points before concentrating on the specific issue of housing.There has been a budget every week for the past 18 months with the announcement of stealth taxes on a daily basis, never mind a weekly basis, and the concept of an annual budget is almost a thing of the past. This year we had a particular rabbit pulled out of the hat with the trick of decentralisation. We were told that this was a major budgetary announcement but it was nothing short of a rabbit out of the hat and an illusion or trick to deflect people's concentration from the ridiculous project announced in the budget. I note that the Minister for Finance managed to refer only to what he would regard as the better items in the budget. He did not bother referring to some of the serious cutbacks in the Book of Estimates.Decentralisation is itself a misnomer. It connotes the concept of devolving Government to either local government or some type of authority in the regions. Nothing could be further from the truth. We know central government has been taking powers from local authorities. We have seen that with planning regulations and levies and waste management plans. This means that, far from decentralisation taking place, the opposite is happening under the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and has happened under his predecessors.What is happening is a relocation, which in itself is dubious. While I support the concept, I question the sincerity of the Government's announcement because apparently there has been no planning for this relocation. No budget has been announced for it save that we are told that, for any buildings to be built wherever the relocation is happening, buildings in Dublin must first be sold to provide the necessary money. Is that budgeting? It leaves a lot to be desired.Cock-up might not be a parliamentary term, but the greatest catastrophe of all in the relocation process is that the unions involved have not been consulted about their members going—
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	421	The Deputy will be surprised.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	422	They say they were not consulted and various Ministers have said they did not consult civil servants. The unions involved have all expressed considerable alarm at the announcement. It is time the rabbit was put back in the hat so that the Government can get on with the serious work at hand. That is much more important than carrying on with this nonsense.The budget represents an attack on the poor. The social welfare cutbacks amounting to €58 million announced by the Minister of Social and Family Affairs will widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Social welfare increases and alleged tax benefits for the lower paid have been eaten up by welfare cuts and stealth taxes. Child benefit will increase by a mere €6 per month while 300,000 children live in poverty, which is a scandal. The poor and low paid will also suffer because the lowest ever proportion of the population is eligible for a medical card. What has happened to the Fianna Fáil pre-election promise to include an extra 200,000 people in the general medical services scheme? We all know how it stands but no Minister or Government backbencher has shared the answer with us.The budget has failed to tackle the inequality in the taxation system. The Minister did nothing to target the highest earners or to tackle multimillionaire tax exiles or tax evasion. More people will pay the higher rate of income tax following the budget. A total of 60,000 workers on the average industrial income will be liable to pay tax at the marginal rate of 42%, the same as if they were millionaires or super earners. Stealth taxes are announced on a daily basis in the form of bin charges, planning levies or hospital charges.I would like to correct the record of the House which was distorted by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last week. During the debate he grossly misrepresented Sinn Féin's policy on taxation. He deliberately stated Sinn Féin was seeking to increase the top rate of taxation to 50% to create the impression that all workers who pay the current top rate of 42% would pay 50%. This is completely and calculatedly false. Sinn Féin has called for a new top rate of 50% for people with an income in excess of €100,000 per annum to ensure the highest paid will contribute their fair share. The Minister knows this well but he could not resist the temptation to put the boot in, even if this meant distorting the facts.The budget will do nothing for people attempting to house themselves and their families. What is in the budget for the 48,000 people on housing waiting lists, 85% of whom have an annual income of less than €15,000? What has it done for the 5,581 homeless people in the State? The Government has chosen to attack rent allowance for the second consecutive year and this will result in an increase in homelessness because vulnerable people cannot get into the private rented sector. It is a year since the Government abolished the first-time buyer's grant, leaving people in that category much worse off. This measure should have been reinstated in the budget and should have been applied to both new and second hand homes.The failure to address the problem of local government funding will also exacerbate the housing crisis. Local authorities are imposing significant development charges, which are passed on to new house buyers, because local government is not properly funded and this makes houses increasingly unaffordable.A number of local authorities are seeking to get out of housing provision, even though it is one of their core functions similar to the provision of water and sewerage schemes. That also says a great deal about so-called decentralisation. The Government's once-off increase in local government funding will do nothing to tackle deficiencies in such funding, which must be addressed as a priority.It is seriously questionable that the budget does not provide for the ending of tax relief for speculative buyers of second homes and the restoration of capital gains tax to its 1997 level of 40%. The budget shamefully fails to make adequate funding available to increase the total social housing rental stock and to bring about the reduction and elimination of housing waiting lists. The Government thinks such lists and the major difficulties associated with the affordability of houses are an acceptable part of life for the disadvantaged. This regressive behaviour is an absolute scandal in this day and age and should be addressed.A host of stealth taxes is introduced on a daily basis and the concept of an annual budget is a thing of the past. It is unfortunate the Government did not at least live up to its pre-election promises, particularly in regard to medical cards, which fooled the people into electing it.

The budget was a clever act of deception as with no hands the Government kept its hand on the coloured handkerchief of decentralisation while it withered away people's quality of life and returned no more in benefits than it took in taxes. The Government mesmerises us with facts and figures about increases in social welfare and the widening of tax bands while the magician, Deputy McCreevy, attempts to grab the wealth by stealth. If one is wealthy, he will make one richer. The increases contained in the budget mean Deputies will receive as much as the low paid. The Minister can normally be relied on for razzmatazz. However, times are getting tough and, at the end of the show, more people will pay tax with no tangible return in terms of their quality of life. The less well off are in the cheap seats and they will be left on the scrap heap at the end of the performance, hopefully in 2005 rather than 2006 or 2007.

The entire decentralisation programme bears no resemblance to the national spatial strategy. Its intention is to relocate central Government to areas where Ministers can claim to have delivered. A total of 130 Irish Prison Service employees will move from Clondalkin to Longford, even though only one person from Longford works in the service. Deputy Sexton can claim a victory like Deputy Parlon while the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will hope her personal popularity protects her from a backlash.The Green Party supports decentralisation but this is anything but and is only a distraction. This mediocre budget contains no vision, compassion or decrease in the gap between the rich and the poor. My pet cat, Fluffy, has more compassion in her hind paws than the budget or this sad Government. This is a holding budget as the Minister waits for give-away budgets prior to the election in 2007.

However, I also welcome the increase in funding for schools building projects and multi-annual funding for capital projects. The Green Party proposed the allocation of €2.5 billion over four years. This is a greater allocation, which is index linked to inflation. The issue is whether investment will generate both economic and non-economic returns.More funding is required so that the National Educational Welfare Board can operate fully and efficiently. The National Youth Council of Ireland stated the budget bypasses young people and raises serious questions about the Government's commitment to them. The Government made a number of commitments under Sustaining Progress, for example, which have not been honoured in the budget. The NYC sought an increase of €5 million but received only €1 million extra.Rent supplement will be refused to people who have not rented for six months and lone parents are discriminated against. For example, people in receipt of one parent family allowance or widow's pension are still expected to pay employee PRSI contributions while the one year half rate for one parent family claimants and the half rate child allowance have been withdrawn. Unemployment benefit has been reduced from 15 to 12 months and the dietary allowance will be phased out over a number of years. This will not be a problem if one is a Member of this House and a coeliac. However, it is a major problem if one is on social welfare.The crèche supplement to cover emergency child care will be discontinued. There are also community employment and JI cutbacks. Given that I will raise those issues on the Adjournment, I will elaborate on them at that stage.

The Minister of State can criticise all he likes in his contribution. It could have been a positive budget and tax credits could have been made available.There is an argument that Government should tax and spend – that it should increase income tax to pay for services which will have long-term benefits. If the Government was honest, there might be some merit in the argument. Let us consider, for example, the issue of green taxes and Government obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. If the Government examined the situation it could reduce income tax and employers' PRSI and increase green taxes instead. This would increase economic competitiveness and have a neutral impact from a budgetary point of view.I raised the issue of the public's faith in the political process before but was accused of being a hypocrite. Today I wrote to all Deputies on a matter I feel compelled to raise once again, namely, PPP – politicians, pay and perception. When I described the pay and expenses of Oireachtas Members as a urination on the less well-off, I was not being facetious. I was trying to be polite because the cutbacks in real terms are an issue when we seem to have double standards in terms of our pay and expenses. I do not in general disagree with the benchmarking process being tied in with the pay of senior civil servants but it is higher in real percentage terms.The public perception of politics has never been lower. There are double standards for those who walk through the corridors of power compared to those who kick their way through broken bottles and syringes in less sheltered areas. This perception is exacerbated by the extremely lax system of expenses, where I can sit at home, butter my toast, fill in a form and claim €61 a day without a check. I stated the matter before and will not go into it now. However, as long as we have this perceived unfairness, the fat cat tag for politicians will remain.We know the hours required by the job. The Minister of State is a prime example of an excellent Deputy who works long hours and whose non-sitting days are as busy as sitting days. The public do not understand this and are influenced by media reports which correctly highlight the lack of days spent considering legislation but sometimes wrongly imply that the rest of time is spent doing nothing. I was rooting for some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies on "Liveline" with Joe Duffy. The criticism is fuelled by the public knowledge that while our long hours are reasonably well rewarded, they are topped up by generous expenses, some of which do not have to be vouched for. We are accepting our benchmarking award increases at a time when others are suffering and insulting those struggling through no fault of their own.I disagree with Members of the Seanad who wasted their Order of Business time by attacking me personally in an over the top defence of their pay and conditions. They protested a little too much but failed to put up a coherent argument. I agree that I sometimes wear an open-necked shirt, am still relatively young and may just fall into the category of "gentleman". However, that has nothing to do with real debate. An opposing argument eloquently put deserves some respect. Given the array of talent among the group concerned there was no eloquence, only insults which are like water off this green duck's back. Further discourse is needed.Deputy Fiona O'Malley has been quoted as saying that we need more visible parliamentary productivity from these Houses. I fully agree. In the absence of such productivity, we should give up our increase, collectively, as a gesture towards those who earn less in a week on social welfare than we get in unvouched for expenses for turning up for work. I call once again for a voluntary pay freeze and tighter expenses. I will write to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in this regard. The lax expense payments speak for themselves but more motivation is needed with regard to our pay increase.Despite stating that collective argument would be preferable, it seems that money must be put where the mouth is. Although, on principle, I have given up €12,800 and the sweetener for giving up the dual mandate, I am still being accused of hypocrisy for not forgoing my benchmarking increase. Therefore, I am announcing that I will give up my benchmarking increase. However, I will not give it to the Exchequer but to those organisations affected directly by the cutbacks. I urge other Members to do the same, particularly Deputy Fiona O'Malley who indicated in the newspapers that she might give up her increase. However, on Newstalk 106, the Deputy said something different. I ask her to clarify this issue.We need to increase the goodwill of the public towards politicians. Local elections are on the way. The Government may, perhaps, hope that the low turnout will continue and the same old die-hards will vote its people in where communities such as south-west Clondalkin are ravaged by cutbacks. I will elaborate on that issue in the debate on CE. I ask other Deputies and Senators to consider forgoing their benchmarking pay rise as a gesture to those who are less well off. We are approaching Christmas and although it is a bit of a cliché, I hope some of the Christmas spirit will emerge. When everyone else has to make sacrifices, Deputies and Senators should do likewise.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I have sat and listened to a lot of talk and nonsense over the past few days about a fair society and a budget based on equity. If we examine the details closely we can see it is neither a fair nor caring budget. This is a budget for the well-off. There is a cosy consensus around this House, and in broader political circles, that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, for example, is doing a good job. I strongly disagree.Let us look at the facts. This is not a caring budget and the €1.50 a week increase in child benefit is derisory as it is just 21 cent a day. That is a disgrace. Basic welfare increases are not generous. There is no increase in child dependant allowance, families are still stuck in the poverty trap and there was no attempt to abolish the means test for the carer's allowance. Despite the fact that carers save the State approximately €1.6 billion, they are treated with contempt. Only an extra €25 million was provided for disability whereas Punchestown got €15 million. Most people campaigning for funding for those with intellectual disabilities wanted €35 million. This has happened at a time when we have 1,382 people on residential waiting lists, 621 seeking day care places and 823 families waiting for respite care.Let us remind ourselves again of what the Minister provided. She gave 21 cent a day in child benefit. The Government claims to be pro-family and children yet backbenchers dance up and down on the issue of stem cell research while 70,000 children live in extreme poverty. It is about time this Government began to live in the real world.We have also seen pensions cut for new recruits to the Civil Service. We will now have a two-tier Civil Service. Young people have been bypassed by budget 2004. We see 5,000 young people drop out of our education system each year and 1,000 young students do not make the transfer to second level. Educational disadvantage was ignored in the budget and we now have a situation where approximately 1,800 children are seriously at risk. We could have done with an extra €20 million for educational disadvantage.There is a lack of planning in this budget. It lacks a vision for the future and shows the direction in which the country is heading.

In today's edition of The Irish Times he writes of the Minister who introduced this particular measure and states:Our wealth has been created by opting for an open economy, with low taxes and a flexible, intelligent workforce – 100,000 of whom will change jobs this year. We have the most open economy in the world, and we have in Charlie McCreevy the most successful Minister for Finance in the history of the State; indeed, the most successful in all of Europe.That speaks volumes about the credit people are prepared to give this Government for the enormous changes the Minister and the Government have introduced, not just with this seventh chapter in his ten chapter book. I welcome his pledge to deliver another three budgets in the lifetime of this Government.This has been a reforming Government, as was its predecessor. Far from being harsh, this budget is redistributive. It redistributes income from middle and higher income earners to those who are on no income or on very low incomes. Upwards of 30,000 people are being taken out of the tax net and will pay no tax as a result of this budget. Neither of the two previous speakers referred to the fact that those on social welfare will receive increases of 6% to 8% when the inflation target of 2.5%. That is a fantastic achievement.I am proud to be a Member associated with this redistributive left-wing Government that has introduced this budget. It is the first tangible sign that economic recovery is under way, and I look forward to it being fully delivered over the next three years in the run up to the next election.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I am pleased to see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle back in the House so soon. In the past two years, the number of places available on community employment schemes has been reduced by 3,800 to approximately 20,000. The Government will save €135 million by making these reductions. However, no programme has been put in place to secure the future of the services provided by the schemes that have been cut. Consequently, a large number of organisations have been forced to reduce or in many cases terminate services. While a new programme may be introduced in rural areas, in urban areas there has been no indication as to what will happen or what the transition will be like.The cutbacks in community employment schemes have affected the relatively well-off areas of Lucan, Palmerstown, Saggart, Rathcoole, Brittas and Newcastle, but the worst affected is Clondalkin. Although north Clondalkin is in a RAPID programme area and has well-organised community bases, the chipping away of community employment and jobs initiative schemes is taking its toll. South-west Clondalkin, however, does not have this comfort blanket. There is huge deprivation in a number of areas, yet it was not chosen as a RAPID programme area because it has a high number of private homes. However, in many of these homes the owners are struggling to make a living, while many more are occupied by tenants on rent allowance. The local community employment scheme was a saviour to this area. While these schemes were not set up to provide an alternative social economy or much needed social services, that is what they have ended up doing. In removing them, the Government has ripped the stitch that kept the community lining together and it is now in danger of collapse.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, officially opened the Bawnogue enterprise centre, which operates on a semi-commercial basis promoting local businesses. However, its remit prevents it in assisting a community struggling against years of neglect, criminal elements, the drugs trade and a breakdown in the sense of community. The enterprise centre charges commercial rates for various meetings while the rooms are not the right size for various groupings. The Bawnogue youth and community centre was one of the three community projects supported by the local community employment scheme. There was also the youth and family support group and the DBD advice and information centre, all of which are now facing closure.The Bawnogue community centre provides a centre to the community in more ways than one. For example, the local children use its tuck shop because they feel safer there than the local shops where drug pushers and addicts hang around. Yet, it is now facing closure. The community groups operating there have seen their staff numbers dwindle to a bare minimum following the cutbacks in the community employment scheme. Though, it is proposed to move some council and other State-supported bodies into the building, the original community services provided are falling apart. These are the services in which people have a sense of pride and self-esteem because they have been built from scratch.I urge the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to make representations to save the DBD advice and information centre. It is a long way to Clondalkin village for the many people who have come to depend on its services. I also urge him to ensure that the temporary staff loaned from north Clondalkin to the Bawnogue community centre are retained. If the State discontinues funding it will cost it more in the long-term in terms of trying to root out crime, solve the drugs problem and deal with social alienation.I say this from an economic viewpoint because that is the only argument the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, understands. If the Government wants to keep taxes low and break down the barriers in society, it can only do so by helping to foster thriving communities where people can depend on one another and work together. The community employment schemes have employed people aged over 50 years who were on disability and invalidity allowances, yet but for the valuable work they do on behalf of their communities, they would be only considered for the scrapheap in terms of trying to secure gainful employment. If the new replacement for the schemes is to be introduced, there should be a transition phase run by FÁS so that the existing groups can continue their work. If not, their abolition will cost the State more in the long run and lead to the death of some communities.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I thank Deputy Gogarty for raising the important subject of the community employment schemes on the Adjournment. He has illustrated the importance of the schemes in the Dublin Mid-West constituency, which is his duty. I accept he has made a reasonable case. It has also been made vigorously by Deputy Curran. The community employment schemes play a vital role in sustaining local community centre services. Deputy Curran is also anxious about the future of the Bawnogue community centre. Local decisions have to be made in a local context and appropriate decisions on priorities must be made by the centres concerned.Substantial resources, amounting to €351 million in total, have been allocated in the Estimates for employment programmes for 2004. This funding allocation will support up to 25,000 places across the three employment schemes, namely the community employment, jobs initiative and social economy schemes. The allocation of places to projects within the Clondalkin area is an administrative matter for FÁS. The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, wishes to emphasise that this allocation of €351 million is similar to the budgeted amount provided in 2003. There will be no reduction in the total level of provision for the three schemes or in the combined participation levels next year.The commitment to fund a continuing pool of up to 25,000 places across the three schemes brings clarity, not only to the levels of activity which can be supported, but will also will enable FÁS to give a clear commitment to support local community services over an agreed period of time. FÁS has been given some flexibility in the management of this financial allocation to maximise the progression of participants in the schemes to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.The future emphasis will now be on refocusing the community employment and job initiative programmes in order to improve the outcome for participating clients. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, considers that a client-centred approach should be developed within schemes to specifically target the individual needs of clients in order to progress those in long-term unemployment towards gainful employment, as there has not been the desired rate of progress from community employment to the open labour market by participants. This is against a backdrop of unprecedented demand by employers for labour, including semi-skilled and low-skilled. For example, the number of work permits issued by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1999 was 6,000. This number has increased steadily over the intervening period to a position where the Department is likely to have issued a record 47,000 permits by the end of 2003.This an important public issue. The easy abuse of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that so readily falls from the lips of Opposition speakers has to be put in the context—

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	437	—of a Minister who has achieved more than any other in terms of securing a state of full employment for the economy. I know many working in the most disadvantaged parts of the Dublin West constituency who admire the Minister because he has restored the work incentive in our communities. That was fundamental to social improvement. Up to 47,000 work permits have been issued because of a shortage of supply in the labour market. Judgments on community employment have to made in that context. Against this background, it cannot be said that there have been no jobs for those leaving community employment at the end of their period of participation. In view of this, it must be asked if the existing participation arrangements are appropriate and in the best interest of the participants.Given the degree of dependence on the community employment scheme for delivery of local community services, which has built up over time, major challenges are being posed by the significant reductions in participation levels in recent years. All of us who work with local organisations are well aware of this. The Government must consider its priorities for delivery of services within the reduced but stable pool of participants available. Agencies and voluntary bodies delivering services at local level will clearly have to decide their priorities, since it is clear that all demands cannot be met. It is by no means clear that the existing services that are either ring-fenced or prioritised are yielding the optimal returns in terms of community needs. It is not sufficient simply to look at the volume of activity, one must also look closely at the activities and services being supported by the 25,000 participants involved across the three employment programmes concerned. This is now being done.With the Estimates allocation for 2004, we now have what has been lacking in recent years – a clear sense of direction as to the future level of CE participation and the level of services that can be provided. This allows the Government to give a form of social guarantee regarding support for service provision. Communities and voluntary groups and agencies can now look forward and plan their future services, in consultation with FÁS, with a much greater degree of certainty as to the potential support from CE.The main focus of any new or restructured community employment scheme should remain clearly on the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups and in particular on the needs of those who participate for personal development and progression to employment in the open labour market.The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is confident that the new certainty regarding CE participation levels, combined with changes in the structure of the programme and a re-assessment of the existing ring-fenced and prioritised services, along with the Budget Statement of the Minister concerning the rural scheme can bring about better outcomes for both the individual participants and the communities being supported through their activity.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I welcome the opportunity to raise this issue. I appeal to the Government to keep its promise made in the health strategy and An Agreed Programme for Government to extend the medical card to an additional 200,000 people living in poverty, with an emphasis on families with children.Recent statements by the Minister for Health and Children suggest that the Government intends to break this promise for the third year in a row. This disregard for the health care rights for children living below the poverty line is unacceptable.We need to extend medical card coverage to more children because it will improve their health. Too often the decision to see the doctor or to obtain prescribed treatment is made on the basis of financial considerations. Removing the issue of affordability will eliminate a major obstacle to equal access to health care for children.More than two years ago, in a major report on the health of Ireland's children, the chief medical officer called for the introduction of universal medical card coverage for children, stressing the importance of socio-economic conditions in determining the health status of children. His report stated:The weight of evidence supports the view that children's health can be traced to social, economic and environmental conditions. Poverty is the most powerful aspect of the social context associated with ill health in children.Despite the chief medical officer's recommendations and the commitments made in the health strategy and An Agreed Programme for Government, nothing has been done to extend the medical card to additional children. As a result, families on very low incomes find themselves having to allocate up to a third or more of their weekly income to cover the cost of a visit to the general practitioner if a child becomes sick.The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Ireland has been a party since 1992, says that all children have a right "to the highest attainable standard of health."  The convention also says that children have the right of access to health services and Governments have the duty to ensure that no child is deprived of this right. The budget did not support measures such as the extension of the medical card that reflect an understanding of our obligations under the convention.In its pre-budget submission this year, the Children's Rights Alliance called on the Minister to begin to extend the medical card to all children by rolling it out, on a phased basis, starting with children under the age of five.The Government must also fund the commitments for children contained in the Framework Document accompanying the national anti-poverty strategy and commitments contained in the health strategy, including an integrated national programme for child health care, protocols and standards for the care of children in hospitals, and expanded mental health services for children and adolescents, including the implementation of the recommendations of the first report of the review group on child and adolescent psychiatric services.The Minister should respond to this submission I received from the Children's Rights Alliance, which has done tremendous work in developing proposals to ensure children are taken care of.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. While I have considerable sympathy with the point of view he expressed, the decision of the previous Government to provide universal cover for those aged over 70 is one that is made and that nobody in the House ever denounced. However, there is considerable merit in the point of view articulated by the Deputy that to invest in the health of children at the youngest age would be a good investment for the community generally. As the Deputy is aware, the decision to allocate funds in the area of health depends on priorities, which need to be determined.I give this reply on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. Under the Health Act 1970 determination of eligibility for medical cards is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board. Other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. The medical card scheme therefore primarily covers those in the lower income groups, and that obviously includes children falling within these groups.I do not accept the contention of the Deputy that children in poverty in Ireland do not receive medical cards as our legislation provides for the determination in such cases, thus allowing them to obtain a medical card. However, as I have said, I have considerable sympathy with the wider issue raised by the Deputy.Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not determined by statute and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be awarded to individual family members on this basis. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, especially children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary position, the Minister regrets that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of the Government.When assessing medical card eligibility the health boards exclude a range of income sources. Many allowances such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card.For those who do not qualify for a medical card, there are a number of schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of medication. Under the long-term illness scheme, persons suffering from a number of conditions can obtain without charge the drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition. Under the drug payment scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.The health strategy includes a series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for health services eligibility. The initiatives adopt recommendations suggested by the review of the medical card scheme which was carried out by health board chief executive officers under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The review recommended streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure a greater degree of fairness and transparency. It also recommended the provision of clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards. Boards should proactively seek out persons who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to services.The health strategy emphasises fairness. Its objective is to reduce health inequalities in our society. Shorter waiting times for public patients are prioritised along with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. Since the commencement of the national treatment purchase fund in July 2002, 8,922 people have been treated. Of these, 1,436 were children. In addition, there are clear commitments in the strategy to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. There will be continued investment in services for older people and people with disabilities, and initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers, refugees and prisoners. The national anti-poverty strategy health targets will be implemented.The targets to reduce health inequalities discussed in the Government's review of the national anti-poverty strategy were developed in the course of an extensive consultation process. They have been integrated into the national health strategy. Key health targets of the strategy are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10% by 2007. It is also aimed to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population.Policy measures to implement these targets as outlined in the Framework Document for the national anti-poverty strategy review and the report of the working group on the anti-poverty strategy and health have been taken on board in the national health strategy. Due to the wide range of factors which affect health status and health inequalities, the national health strategy envisages targets being met through a range of actions. These actions will involve a greater focus on multisectoral work and health impact assessments.

This is the third time this year that I have raised this matter in the Dáil. On the previous occasion, I was specifically concerned about what Dublin communities in particular were saying. They have identified an increased use of cocaine by young people. On 21 October, the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, replied to me that he did not think young people of 15 and 16 years of age were using cocaine. He said it was still people well into their 20s and 30s who were more likely to be using it. As the communities have been telling the Minister and as has been published yesterday in the report of the national advisory committee on drugs, the fact is that 5.1% of young people aged between 15 and 24, or one in every 20, is abusing cocaine. This is a shameful and disgraceful scenario.The Minister does not seem to care. He has not even turned up to address the issue. It is appalling and reprehensible. If the Government cares about our young people, it will take on board the recommendations in the report. According to the report, the challenge for drug treatment services must be to reorient part of their traditional opiates-based system to meet the needs of cocaine and other drug users. Only 1% of addicts attending for treatment in Ireland are cocaine users, which is the lowest figure in Europe. The percentage in other member states is much higher. In the Netherlands, cocaine addicts represent 30% attending for treatment and it is 19% in Spain. The figures are lower in Germany, Italy and Luxembourg. The reason Ireland has the lowest number presenting for treatment is that people do not believe the treatment is worthwhile. According to a survey, they are unaware of the dangers posed by the drug.The Minister has a problem on his hands with which he must deal effectively and efficiently. He must focus the resources of the Government on educating young people, especially those between the ages of 15 and 24. They must be told of the dangers of cocaine and of mixing it with alcohol. They must be made aware of the trauma of young people presenting at hospital with serious heart attacks as described by a consultant in Cork during the week. Cocaine is destroying young people's lives. The Government is failing to take adequate steps to change the national drugs strategy to develop the focus, support and financial resources needed to fight cocaine use.Almost every week on the streets of Dublin, some drug baron is murdered and someone is seriously assaulted. Drugs are a serious problem. Many millions of euro are being made from them and people are being murdered. Irish people are dying because there is an insufficient degree of support for people who abuse cocaine. That is the kernel of the national drug advisory committee's report. That is the issue the Government must address.

Every effort is being made to provide the resources needed to work towards that target. Despite the many pressures on the public finances at present, an allocation of €399 million is to be made in 2004 to my Department's Vote for international co-operation. In addition, elements of ODA which are administered by other Departments are expected to total some €80 million next year. Total spending on ODA, therefore, is expected to approach €480 million in 2004, the highest ever in the history of the programme. This level of expenditure in difficult budgetary circumstances demonstrates the profound commitment of the Government to the attainment of the UN target.

The convention made significant headway towards making the European Union's treaties simpler and more accessible. It is, however, encouraging that, in the same poll, 71% of Irish people said that they intend to read the new treaty now being considered by the Intergovernmental Conference. It is important that people inform themselves in this way. The Government will continue to work to foster public debate, including through the national forum on Europe.The Intergovernmental Conference is now in the final stages of its work. It is clear that many of the excellent recommendations made by the convention in simplifying the treaties and incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights, making it clearer to the citizen who does what and at what level. I would, therefore, not agree with those who contend that the work of the convention is being undermined. There are a number of outstanding issues to be addressed in the Intergovernmental Conference. However, with the right political will, I believe that these can be resolved in the meeting in Brussels which will begin tomorrow.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	464	Most EU partners now have in place scrutiny procedures to ensure that their parliaments are informed of and have an opportunity to influence their governments in relation to the EU law making process. The procedures differ from one member state to another.As regards Finland, the grand committee of the Finnish Parliament, which scrutinises draft EU laws, has been in existence since 1907 as a scrutinising body for national legislation. When Finland joined the EU in 1995, it was decided that this body would assume responsibility for the scrutiny of draft EU law which impacts on or results in new or amended domestic legislation. The views expressed by the Finnish Parliament on matters which fall within the parliament's competence are, as I understand it, politically binding. Another parliamentary committee, the foreign affairs committee, reviews common foreign and security policy issues.Enhanced provisions for the scrutiny by the Oireachtas of EU business were introduced by the Government in July 2002, and placed on a statutory basis in the EU (Scrutiny) Act in October 2002. These procedures provide for the scrutiny by the Oireachtas of most draft legal measures at an early stage of their development. Under the terms of the EU (Scrutiny) Act, the Government shall have regard to the views expressed by the Oireachtas.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Despite considerable progress in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which ended the conflict in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in 2001, there have in recent months been a number of isolated violent incidents in the country. Some of the incidents have been blamed on armed gangs engaged primarily in organised crime. The so-called Albanian National Army has also claimed responsibility for acts of violence in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in neighbouring areas in the western Balkans. The ANA is a loosely organised extremist group which purports to stand for the creation of a greater Albania. It is illegal in Macedonia and its support among ethnic Albanians in the region appears to be very limited.I discussed the continuing improvement of the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with Foreign Minister Ilinka Mitreva, when I met with her in Brussels on 9 December, in advance of the EU-Western Balkans Foreign Ministers meeting. The coalition government led by the pan-Slav SDSM party, in partnership with the leading ethnic Albanian DUI Party, is fully committed to the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement. The objective of the agreement is the creation of a truly multi-ethnic Macedonia. It provides for a series of constitutional amendments to safeguard minority rights, strengthen local government and secure equitable representation for the two main ethnic communities at all levels of state administration. Major legislative progress has been made in the past two years and further progress is expected in the period ahead. The Macedonian Government is also committed to the full implementation of all commitments under the stabilisation and association agreement concluded with the EU in 2001.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Ireland views the new partnership for Africa's development as one of the most important strategic developments in Africa in recent decades. The United Nations General Assembly has endorsed NEPAD as an African-owned and led initiative and confirmed that international support for its implementation is essential. Ireland strongly considers that the international community must fully seize the partnership opportunities presented by NEPAD to advance sustainable economic and social development in Africa.The African Union summit meeting in Maputo in July 2002 decided that NEPAD should be formally adopted as the socio-economic development programme of the African Union. The European Union has welcomed this development, with the Council of Ministers last July noting that the sectoral and thematic priorities of NEPAD are practically the same as in the Cairo plan of action, adopted at the initial EU-AU summit in Cairo in 2000.While NEPAD contains a range of structures involving different levels of participation by African countries, its absorption into the African Union over a three year period and the strong relationship also existing between NEPAD and the major regional economic communities in Africa ensure that NEPAD is much an instrument benefiting all African countries through its formulation of appropriate development strategies.

Although progress is being made in this regard, this positive development is offset by the growing violence and the deep sense of concern which this is generating. The support of the Iraqi people and of neighbouring countries is crucial to the successful transfer of sovereignty.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC, has been decimated by conflict over many years. War has destroyed many parts of the country and has further crippled an already weak population. Morbidity, mortality and HIV/AIDS rates are very high and access to basic social services is practically non-existent. These are key indicators of a grave humanitarian crisis.The Government has provided approximately €2 million in humanitarian and development assistance to the DRC in 2003. This funding has been provided to a range of humanitarian organisations including UNICEF, Medicins sans Frontieres, the World Health Organisation and Concern. Irish assistance has focused on water and sanitation programmes, primary and emergency health care and livelihood security.In 2002, a little over €2 million was provided to Concern, Goal, Trocaire, Oxfam, World Vision, UNICEF and the International Rescue Committee for humanitarian operations in the DRC. This funding also included assistance for victims of the volcanic eruption in Goma.In 2003 the DRC entered a new phase in its political history. The previous government and former rebel groups have united for the first time under the banner of national unity and formed a new transitional government. There is cautious optimism about the future of the country. During 2004, Ireland will continue to assist efforts to alleviate and prevent human suffering in the DRC. We will help to rebuild livelihoods and facilitate co-ordination mechanisms which link relief with longer-term development. Support will be provided for humanitarian operations and, where appropriate, recovery initiatives in the DRC. I expect that funding next year to the DRC from Ireland will be broadly on the same scale as 2003, or will show a slight increase, especially if the momentum for recovery gathers pace.

With the accession of ten new member states on 1 May 2004, and against the background of the proposed new constitutional treaty, the Government believes that it is increasingly important that all EU citizens are well informed about developments in their Union and how it impacts on their day to day lives.Ireland will be the first country to host such a ministerial conference. This reflects the priority that the Government accords to ensuring that the public are aware of and fully engaged in developments in the EU.

Relations between Ireland and Israel are well established and friendly and I would expect that, during our Presidency, we should have the opportunity to build on those relations. In the European Union's dealings with other states, the role of the Presidency is to present the positions of the Union on the basis of agreed positions acceptable to all its member states.During our Presidency Ireland will work within the international quartet to advance the roadmap and achieve a two state solution. The road map contains all the elements, which must form part of any comprehensive settlement.I met my Israeli counterpart in Brussels on 18 November, in the margins of the General Affairs and External Relations Council, and discussed with him the Irish approach to the Middle East conflict during our Presidency. I assured him that we would play an active role as the representative of the European Union in the international quartet. In addition, we had an exchange of views on other issues, including the question of Ireland sponsoring a resolution condemning anti-semitism at the current session of the United Nations in New York.

While a ceasefire has been in place for some time between the parties, the conflict in the Western Sahara has given rise to serious humanitarian issues, which remain unresolved, including the problem of the Saharaoui refugees in Algeria.The Government is concerned over the fates of the combatants in the conflict in the Western Sahara, including the fates of those who disappeared during the conflict and the continuing detention of Moroccan prisoners-of-war by the Polisario. The Government firmly believes there is a compelling humanitarian case that all prisoners be released immediately and without preconditions.The recent release by Polisario of 300 of these prisoners was a welcome step. Some 614 prisoners remain in Polisario custody. The Government is satisfied that appropriate arrangements are in place for international humanitarian access, in particular by the International Committee of the Red Cross, to the prisoners still being held. We would wish to see all parties meeting their humanitarian obligations in full without further delay.The Government has raised its concerns on these issues in all appropriate fora and will continue to raise these issues in contacts both bilaterally and in concert with our EU partners.

The Irish ambassador to Iran is also accredited to Pakistan. Ireland also has an honorary consul in Karachi.The opening of Irish missions abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis. As the Deputy will appreciate constraints on Government expenditure and the limits on the resources that could be made available for opening new missions require that any expansion of our diplomatic network must be incremental and be based on a thorough assessment of the costs and benefits involved.At present there are no plans to open an embassy in Pakistan.

The group noted that some of the recommendations of the task force report would take some time to implement and would therefore have to be phased over a number of years.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I have strongly condemned the bomb attacks in Istanbul on 15 and 20 November, in which 62 people were killed and more than 450 injured. These attacks are a further manifestation of the evil of international terrorism. They targeted two synagogues, where innocent people were at worship, the British consulate general and the HSBC Bank. The Government conveyed sympathy on behalf of the Irish people to the government and people of Turkey. We also conveyed sympathy to the British Government on the unjustifiable attack on its mission and the tragic deaths of a number of personnel, including the consul general, Mr. Roger Short.When I met the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr. Gul, in Naples on 29 November, I extended my personal condolences and assured him of our solidarity with the Turkish Government in these difficult days. Mr. Gul briefed me on the investigations into the attacks, which the Turkish authorities believe were carried out by a small terrorist cell with links to Al Qaida. He stressed that there was no support within Turkey for the attackers or for their methods.The attacks came at an important point in the development of relations between the EU and Turkey. Mr. Gul assured me of the determination of the Turkish Government to proceed with the reform process in preparation for the decision to be taken by the European Council in December 2004 on Turkey's fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria. I welcomed the significant advances achieved to date in a wide range of legislative reforms. Implementation of these reforms will be the key for the decision to be taken by the European Council, on the basis of a report and recommendation from the Commission.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I made a statement to the House on 5 March 2003 on India and Pakistan. On 2 November 2002, the new government of Jammu and Kashmir was sworn in following elections in September and October. The government is a coalition involving the Congress Party and the People's Democratic Party. The new administration is committed to dialogue as a means of resolving the problem in Jammu and Kashmir.There is a long-running history of conflict between India and Pakistan. These two nuclear armed countries came close to the brink of war on two occasions in 2002. However, while the situation remains serious, there have recently been encouraging political developments. Full diplomatic relations have been restored and civil aviation and communications links are in the process of being restored. However, these developments have taken place against the background of ongoing violent incidents on the ground.On 23 November 2003, Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali announced a ceasefire along the international border with India and the line of control in Kashmir. Following a positive response from India, both countries agreed to observe the ceasefire from 25 November 2003. This development follows the initiatives taken by the government of India on 22 October when a range of confidence building measures were proposed, including restoring transport links between India and Pakistan and people to people contacts. On the same day, the Indian Government invited the all-party Hurriyat alliance of Kashmir separatist parties, which had boycotted recent state elections, to talks at the level of deputy prime minister. These recent developments will help to reduce tensions ahead of the South Asia Association for Regional Co-operation, SAARC, summit in Islamabad scheduled to take place in January 2004, which India has confirmed it will attend.

I was very pleased to participate in a meeting, in troika format, with the African Union in Rome on 10 November which resulted in agreement on new modalities for revitalising and enhancing the EU-Africa dialogue. Ireland is fully supportive of these new arrangements, including greater use of the troika format, which will provide for more efficient dialogue and create the opportunity for its further enhancement during our Presidency.In order to build on the renewed impetus to EU-Africa dialogue, Ireland, as EU President, intends to host a ministerial meeting with the African Union in Dublin on 1 April 2004. This meeting will provide an opportunity to enhance EU-Africa dialogue on issues such as peace and security and conflict prevention and resolution and to discuss other issues of mutual concern such as Zimbabwe.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I am aware of the initiative on the proposed international arms trade treaty, also referred to as the draft framework convention on international arms transfers, which is being promoted by a group of non-governmental organisations, NGOs. It is intended to be a legally binding agreement with core principles and mechanisms relating to international transfers of arms.An official of my Department participated in a conference held last month at Cambridge University in England, the purpose of which was to examine the text of the draft treaty from a legal perspective. As a result of these discussions, I understand that further work will be carried out to clarify some of the provisions of the draft treaty. The question of the adoption of the proposed international arms trade treaty has also been scheduled for discussion later this month at working group level within the EU.While work on drafting the text is still ongoing, it is a promising initiative and I commend the NGOs concerned for their efforts. A welcome aspect of the draft treaty is that it has the objective of setting out states' existing international legal obligations in the area of international transfers of arms. In addition, once ratified, the draft framework treaty would enable the international community to move forward incrementally, by means of subsequent more specific instruments.I am conscious of the adverse humanitarian, socioeconomic and international security implications of the global illicit trade in small arms and light weapons and its impact in particular on the African continent. In the past two years, Ireland has contributed a total of €148,000 to the safer Africa project for technical assistance to the Southern Africa Development Community, SADC. This is an illustration of Ireland's real commitment to implement the terms of the UN's programme of action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects, which was adopted by the UN in July 2001.

Seventy of the temporary posts are based in the political division and the European Union division of the Department. These divisions have the task of ensuring that the EU's internal and external agendas are managed successfully during Ireland's Presidency. An additional 30 officers have also been temporarily assigned to the permanent representation to the EU in Brussels, in addition to approximately 40 officers assigned there for the Presidency by other Departments. A number of other divisions and missions abroad have received additional staff for Presidency related tasks.Many of the temporary posts have been filled by officers on Civil Service Commission promotion panels who are awaiting new permanent assignments. After the Presidency, they will be appointed to their new Departments or, if they have not been assigned in the meantime, will return to their parent Departments. Other temporary posts have been filled by officers who have been permanently or temporarily redeployed to the Department from other Departments and offices, by interns or temporary clerical staff at headquarters or locally employed by missions and by officers who have returned from career breaks or special leave.The Department of Foreign Affairs budget for 2003 includes a provision of €12 million for Presidency related commitments. The Presidency budget for the Department for 2004 will be €25 million.

#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The Government has prioritised HIV/AIDS on the development agenda for its Presidency of the EU in 2004. Development Co-operation Ireland and the Department of Health and Children will co-host a ministerial conference, Breaking the Barriers – Partnership for an Effective Response to HIV/AIDS in Europe and Central Asia, in Dublin Castle on 23 and 24 February 2004. The conference is being organised in co-operation with UNAIDS, UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and the European Commission.The conference takes place against the background of a continuing rise in HIV/AIDS prevalence rates across the European and central Asian region. The increase in prevalence rates in some countries has reached a level which poses an immediate and significant challenge for Governments. The conference, which will probably be the biggest event based in Ireland during the Presidency, will focus on four key areas: the need for stronger dialogue and co-operation at the regional level; the appropriate role of Governments, civil society and the private sector; preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS, particularly among young people; and the challenges facing people living with AIDS, including access to care and treatment. It is anticipated that the conference will adopt a declaration which will provide a basis for future strengthened co-operation across the region.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The embassy in Washington DC is in ongoing contact with the US authorities across the full range of our interests, including the status of undocumented Irish citizens living in the US. In this regard, the embassy continuously monitors the situation, including assessing the potential for measures to regulate the status of the undocumented. While we understand that some consideration is being given by some members of Congress to possible new initiatives, they seem unlikely in the current climate to involve amnesties or special measures that would regularise the position of the undocumented Irish.Our embassy and consulates maintain a close working relationship with Irish immigration groups in the US. Through this channel, and through their broader contacts with the Irish community and their representatives, the embassy and the consulates monitor the situation with regard to the undocumented Irish in the US. The diversity programme or Schumer visa lottery was introduced in 1994 and remains an important avenue of legal emigration from Ireland to the US.

The transitional government comprising representatives of the government of President Kabila and the main rebel groups took office last July. This has been followed by the recent swearing-in of rebel leaders among the four vice-presidents of the country. An interim parliament was also officially inaugurated in August. A particularly important development which I welcome was the meeting on 25 September of representatives of the DRC, Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda in the presence of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Annan. The four countries agreed to refrain from interfering in each other's affairs and to prevent arms shipments to warring groups in the eastern area of the DRC.

A number of irregularities have been identified in the conduct of the elections and repeat elections are being organised in a number of municipalities, including Tirana. The ruling Socialist Party retained a majority of municipalities, although its vote was down on the previous local elections held in 2000.Parliamentary business in Albania has been held up in recent months by political disputes, including infighting in the Socialist Party. Following the resignation of the foreign Minister, Mr. Meta, on 18 July, the Government failed to obtain parliamentary approval for a replacement. The next major political event will be the Socialist Party congress on 12 December. The EU agreed to open negotiations with Albania on a stabilisation and association agreement as a result of increased political stability during 2002. The negotiations opened in February and the latest round took place in Tirana on 6 and 7 November.On 9 December, the General Affairs and External Relations Council expressed its concern at the slow pace of reform in Albania. It urged the Albanian Government to intensify its efforts. It is important that progress be made in the fight against organised crime and corruption and that the functioning of democratic institutions and of public administration be improved. The Government and the people of Albania face a daunting challenge in building a new future in co-operation with the EU.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	489	The Deputy will be aware that Ireland has proposed and been the principal sponsor of a resolution on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance, at both the UN General Assembly and the UN Commission on Human Rights, for nearly 20 years. The resolution aims to address all instances of religious intolerance or discrimination based on religion or belief, irrespective of where they occur or who are the victims. Accordingly, Ireland has consistently adopted the view that it should not mention specific types of religious intolerance or discrimination directed against specific religions. For this reason, Ireland opposed requests to include specific mention of anti-semitism in the draft this year. Following considerable negotiation, the resolution was adopted again this year at the third committee without such a reference.Ireland continues to be seriously concerned about the growing problem of anti-semitism. This evil phenomenon combines elements of racism and religious intolerance. This phenomenon deserves to be condemned by the United Nations. Accordingly, as a separate initiative to its resolution on religious intolerance, Ireland decided to seek support for a resolution condemning anti-semitism at the current session of the UN General Assembly. I am glad that we were encouraged in our efforts by our partners in the European Union and the accession states, all of whom co-sponsored the text as drafted. We engaged intensively with a range of interested parties with a view to achieving an agreed outcome and consensus support in the General Assembly for the resolution. In the light of these negotiations, we were obliged to conclude that it was unlikely that the various priorities of interested states could be accommodated simultaneously. Accordingly, with reluctance, we decided not to proceed with this initiative at this stage.While this outcome is disappointing, I consider that the course that we took, with the aim of achieving a strong and unequivocal condemnation of anti-semitism, was the right one. This issue deserves further consideration at the General Assembly. We will remain in close contact with like minded countries with a view to returning to it at an appropriate moment. I wish to underline that Ireland, the EU, member and accession states and others, have made clear their total rejection of this phenomenon by co-sponsoring this resolution on anti-semitism.

Many matters were discussed, including Uganda's involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the findings and recommendations of the Porter judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of illegal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the various reports of the UN panel of experts, which had prompted the establishment and work of the Porter commission, the situation in northern Uganda and the process of political transition to a full democracy in Uganda. There was discussion on trade and aid and on domestic governance issues.On the issue of Uganda's involvement in the DRC, I advised President Museveni of Irish concerns regarding human rights abuses and illegal exploitation of resources. I emphasised the importance of the full implementation of the recommendations of the Porter commission, as promised in the white paper issued by the Ugandan Government. President Museveni made clear that he is committed to taking action against Ugandans involved in illegal activities in the DRC. He reiterated that all Ugandan troops had been withdrawn and that Uganda is fully committed to the peace process in the DRC. In that context, he referred to the proposal for the convening of an international conference on the Great Lakes region, as proposed by the UN Secretary General's special representative to the region, Mr. Ibrahim Fall, and of Uganda's full support for it.

During the discussions leading to the Joint Declaration, a number of pro-agreement parties tabled proposals for change in the operation of the agreement, for instance, in regard to the voting and designation arrangements in the Northern Ireland Assembly and in the nomination arrangements for attendance at meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council.In accordance with a commitment given in the Joint Declaration, the two Governments have jointly written to the parties in the Assembly seeking their views on the conduct and agenda of the review. In the light of the responses received, the two Governments will in January finalise proposals, including a suggested timeframe, for undertaking the review. Both Governments have stressed that the review will be of the operation of the agreement, not of its fundamentals.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Since March 2003, the EU has conducted a military monitoring and stabilisation mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or FYROM, known as "Operation Concordia". In parallel with the conclusion of Operation Concordia on 15 December, and at the invitation of the FYROM authorities, a further EU police mission, "Operation Proxima", will commence. Specific objectives for proxima will include support for the consolidation of law and order, the reform of the Ministry of the Interior and the creation of a border police force in FYROM through monitoring, mentoring and provision of advice to national authorities.In each case, contributions of personnel were invited from all EU member states and from several non-EU member states. Ireland's replies to those specific invitations have been primarily a matter for the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform respectively. In the case of Operation Concordia, 13 EU member states and 14 non-EU member states, comprising accession states, candidate states and non-EU members of NATO, have participated. Ireland did not participate owing to legal advice supplied by the Attorney General which indicated that the particular expression of UN endorsement for the operation as set out in Security Council Resolution No. 1371 does not fully meet the requirements specified in the Defence Acts for participation in missions abroad by Irish Defence Forces personnel.As regards Operation Proxima, final figures remain unavailable at present, but current indications are that the majority of EU member states and acceding states will be participating. As regards Irish participation, the Garda authorities have assigned one officer to the planning of the operation.

Ambassador Haass briefed me on his own recent meetings in Northern Ireland, and our discussions also covered several current international issues of mutual interest.I took the opportunity to express the Government's deep appreciation to President Bush and the US Administration for its continuing support in our efforts towards the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I also thanked Ambassador Haass for his exceptional personal contribution to the peace process. The dedication and commitment displayed by him, particularly at critical junctures, have been of invaluable support.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	497	Ireland's opposition to the Israeli construction of the separation wall has been made known to the Israeli Government and its representatives on numerous occasions. At the EU-Israel Association Council in Brussels on 17 November, EU Foreign Ministers reiterated European opposition to his project when they told the Foreign Minister of Israel: The EU is particularly concerned by the route marked out for the so-called security fence in the Occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The envisaged departure of the route from the "green line" could prejudge future negotiations and make the two-state solution physically impossible to implement. It would cause further humanitarian and economic hardship to the Palestinians. Thousands of Palestinians west of the fence are being cut off from essential services in the West Bank, Palestinians east of the fence will lose access to land and water resources. In this context the EU is alarmed by the designation of land between the fence and the "green line" as a closed military zone. This is a de-facto change in the legal status of Palestinians living in this area which makes life for them even harder. Hence, the EU calls on Israel to stop and reverse the construction of the so-called security fence inside the occupied Palestinian territories, including in and around East Jerusalem, which is in departure of the armistice line of 1949 and is in contradiction to the relevant provisions of international law.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	498	Under the terms of the comprehensive peace agreement that was brokered commendably by the regional organisation, the Economic Community of West African States, or ECOWAS, on 18 August 2003, and which has been endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Gyude Bryant will serve as chairman of the transitional Government until parliamentary and presidential elections are held before the end of 2005. On taking office, Mr. Bryant pledged to introduce transparency in government and respect for human rights. The process of selecting members of the transitional Government and legislative assembly is ongoing. The Irish Government was represented at the inauguration of the Liberian transitional government in Monrovia on October 14 by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.The United Nations Mission in Liberia, or UNMIL, was established on 19 September 2003 under UN Security Council Resolution 1509 for a period of one year. Under the resolution, UNMIL is mandated, inter alia, to observe and monitor the comprehensive ceasefire agreement, to protect, within its capabilities, civilians under imminent threat of violence, to support the provision of humanitarian assistance, to help promote human rights, and to support generally the implementation of the peace process.Despite recent improvements in the security situation in UN-controlled areas and progress in the implementation of the comprehensive peace agreement, the peace process remains fragile. Monrovia is now a weapons free zone, but the situation is less stable in other areas. Sporadic outbreaks of fighting in rebel strongholds highlight the need for a comprehensive process of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration. The disarmament campaign was formally launched by the UN on 1 December.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I have on several occasions made known the Government's concerns regarding the treatment and status of the approximately 660 detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, both in this House and elsewhere. Those concerns are shared by our partners in the EU. The Government, thus far, has received no information to confirm media reports indicating several possible prisoner releases from Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay.Together with our EU partners, we are committed to working with the United States in the fight against international terrorism. However, when confronting those who abuse human rights it is important that the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law be upheld at all times. In that context, the Government welcomes and supports regular visits by international organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross to Camp X-Ray. It has regularly visited Guantanamo Bay prisoners since January 2002 and last met detainees in October 2003.

Sub-Saharan Africa, by far the worst affected region, is now home to over 26.6 million people living with HIV-AIDS. Approximately 3.2 million new infections occurred there in 2003, while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.3 million Africans in the past year.HIV-AIDS is a key priority for the development co-operation Ireland programme. Ireland was one of the first donors to develop a HIV-AIDS strategy and we have worked to ensure that the issue is high on the agenda of the EU and of the UN's funds and programmes. Since 2001, Ireland's financial allocations to the fight against AIDS have increased ten-fold with a budget allocation of €40 million in 2003.This level of funding will be sustained in budget allocations for 2004. These resources are directed at HIV-AIDS activities at the global, regional, national and community levels and are implemented through international and regional organisations and in our programme countries. The latter include six highly affected countries in southern and eastern Africa.

The investigation was completed on 12 August and the final report of the commission was adopted unanimously by the Government of Serbia on 21 August 2003.The main conclusion of the report was that the assassination was the work of a criminal gang, the so-called Zemun gang. The chief suspect was identified as Milorad Lukovic, who had been removed as leader of a paramilitary force, the Red Berets, by Prime Minister Djindjic in 2001. The commission suggested that the assassination was in retaliation for the crackdown on the activities of the Zemun gang undertaken by the government in Belgrade. The gang would appear to have had close links with elements in the security system who remained in place after the collapse of the Milosevic regime.Although Lukovic remains at large, the trial of a number of people arrested in connection with the assassination is scheduled to begin in Belgrade later this month. It will be monitored by the OSCE.The assassination of Zoran Djindjic was an attack on democracy and the reform process in Serbia and Montenegro. The EU has supported the determination of the government in Belgrade to pursue reforms and the fight against organised crime following the Prime Minister's death. General elections will be held in Serbia on 28 December. Ireland as EU President in the first half of 2004 will work with the new government and with the authorities of the state union in support of their commitment to making the progress necessary to advance Serbia and Montenegro's relations with the European Union.

The Government is strongly of the view that EU intervention carries significantly greater force than individual bilateral interventions by national governments.In 1998, the EU adopted guidelines on the abolition of the death penalty, which set out clearly the common EU position on the use of the death penalty. These guidelines now form the basis for Ireland's concerted interventions, along with other EU member states, in death penalty issues.The guidelines state that, where the death penalty still exists, the EU will continue to press for its use to be progressively restricted and for moratoria to be introduced. In addition to interventions on the use of the death penalty in principle, it has also been agreed that, where the facts of individual cases suggest a violation of basic minimum standards under international law, the union will consider making a specific intervention.Since the adoption of the guidelines, the EU has pressed for abolition and has also made démarches or direct diplomatic representations on the use of the death penalty in a number of countries. In 2003, in accordance with the EU guidelines on the death penalty, case-specific démarches were made to a number of countries, including the United States of America, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, China, India, Uzbekistan, Qatar and the Democratic Republic of Congo.In addition to this, the EU frequently raises the issue of the death penalty in démarches on human rights issues, through its human rights dialogues and by raising the issue at appropriate regional and international fora such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the UN Commission on Human Rights. The European Union, including Ireland, was the principal sponsor of a resolution on the death penalty at the Commission on Human Rights earlier this year.The abolition of the death penalty is a political priority for Ireland and our EU partners. Ireland along with our EU partners will continue to work for its worldwide abolition.

As well as the political meetings undertaken, I visited some of development co-operation Ireland's projects in South Africa and Mozambique. On my second day in South Africa, I visited the township of Soweto and saw the devastating impact which HIV-AIDS has on the local population there and also the great work of our development officers, NGOs and missionaries.On 22 November, Foreign Minister Zuma hosted a working dinner at her residence for the Irish delegation. Our discussions covered bilateral relations with South Africa, EU-Africa dialogue, Zimbabwe, UN reform, the WTO and the Middle East. It was a very productive meeting in which I outlined our intention, as EU President, to work in partnership with African governments, including South Africa, to enhance Africa's capacity to deal with the issues which the continent faces. I also agreed with Foreign Minister Zuma to the establishment of a structured bilateral partnership agreement with South Africa to augment the relations between our countries. Regular ministerial and official level dialogue is envisaged and the details will be finalised in the coming months.The following day, I met with President Mbeki and expressed to him our aim to give strong support to African issues during our Presidency next year. We discussed South Africa's role as a successful mediator in various African conflicts, including Burundi. We agreed that effective multilateralism was a common foreign policy aim for both countries and I invited President Mbeki on a state, or indeed official, visit to Ireland at his convenience.In Mozambique, I met with President Chissano, the current President of the African Union. The president spoke of the African Union's, AU, efforts in conflict resolution and of the intensification of our bilateral relations since 1996. He praised the work of development co-operation Ireland in Niasse and Inhumanbane, two of the poorest regions in Mozambique and Ireland's support of the new partnership for Africa's development, NEPAD, initiative.

This policy prevented my meeting Israeli Government Ministers during my visit to the region at the end of June this year, when I met President Arafat. The European Union has maintained a policy of meeting President Arafat, who is the duly elected leader of the Palestinian people. While it is within the rights of the Israeli Government to decide whom it will meet, it is not acceptable that it should dictate to other Governments or their representatives with whom they should engage. At the EU's Association Council with Israel on 17 November this point was made strongly by the Foreign Ministers of Union member states to their Israeli counterpart. I also pointed out the futility of this policy to my Israeli counterpart in a bilateral meeting. At the same time, we have observed that the Israeli policy in this regard has not been consistently applied and it has been possible for some senior figures to meet President Arafat and senior Israeli leaders.

On 23 February 2002 a formal ceasefire agreement was signed, with Norwegian facilitation, between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, also known as the LTTE or the Tamil Tigers, and the Sri Lankan Government. Despite mounting political difficulties on the island, the ceasefire has continued to hold. There have been six rounds of peace talks between the parties which were brokered by the Norwegian Government. However, on 21 April 2003 the LTTE suspended its participation in the peace process and demanded that an interim administration be established to govern the conflict zone. The LTTE claimed that it was not receiving sufficient dividends from the peace process.On 31 October 2003, following rounds of internal talks held in France and Ireland with the facilitation of the respective governments, the LTTE presented proposals to the Sri Lankan Government on an interim administration for the north and east of the country. The proposed interim administration would almost certainly require constitutional change and that, in turn, would need the support of the opposition parties as well as the government.

This development was made possible by the approval by the state union parliament on 28 August of the action plan on the harmonisation of the economies of the two constituent republics.Progress in the reform process in Serbia and Montenegro and on economic harmonisation has been delayed by the political instability of recent months. General elections will be held in Serbia on 28 December. The early formation of a new government committed to speeding up the implementation of reforms, and progress on the implementation of the internal market and trade action plan, would help create the conditions for a positive recommendation from the commission's feasibility study. A significant improvement in the level of co-operation with the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugsolavia would also have a positive impact.I hope that it will prove possible for the Commission to finalise its study during Ireland's EU Presidency. It would then fall to Ireland to guide the issue through its consideration by the Council, with a view to the opening of negotiations. When I met foreign Minister Svilanovic in Brussels on 9 December, I assured him of our willingness to work closely with the democratically elected leaders of Serbia and Montenegro to encourage their efforts to create the conditions for a positive recommendation in the feasibility study next year.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 102 together.I refer the Deputies to my reply to Question No 41 of 13 November 2003.Proposals for an EU security strategy were presented to the Thessaloniki European Council by high representative secretary general Javier Solana in June 2003. Throughout the autumn period, three workshops were held in Rome, Paris and Stockholm. There was broad support for the proposals at these seminars, with discussion focusing on the need for clarification in certain areas. A final text of the strategy, taking account of the outcome of the seminars, as well as contributions from member states, is due to be adopted by the European Council on 12-13 December 2003.The strategy outlines challenges and threats to European and international security such as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, state failure and organised crime. It goes on to focus on strategic objectives of the EU, in particular the need to promote good governance beyond the borders of the EU and to advance the development of an effective multilateralism through support for the United Nations. Finally, the strategy considers policy implications for Europe in light of these threats and strategic objectives. It concludes that the EU should become more active, more capable and more coherent.Against this background, it can be seen that a description of the document as a defence doctrine would be misleading in view of the holistic approach to security issues that it reflects. Since the outset, Ireland has expressed broad support for the proposed security strategy. The process of revising the document has not altered its fundamental character, which remains broadly consistent with Ireland's perspective on security and defence matters through its embodiment of a comprehensive approach to security, including military and non-military means. The Government, therefore, welcomes the document as an important contribution which will assist in the elaboration and prioritisation of future EU foreign policy activities.As incoming President, Ireland will working closely with high representative secretary general Javier Solana to carry forward work on implementation of the strategy.

The Government played a prominent role in seeking a solution to the Western Sahara dispute during its term on the Security Council.While a ceasefire has been in place for some time between the parties, the conflict in the Western Sahara has given rise to serious humanitarian issues which remain unresolved, including the situation of the Saharaoui refugees in Algeria and that of Moroccans held prisoner by Polisario for almost three decades as well as the fate of missing Saharaouis that has yet to be established.On 31 July 2003 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1495 which extended the mandate of the UN mission for the referendum in Western Sahara, MINURSO, until 31 October 2003. On 28 October 2003 the Security Council adopted Resolution 1513, authorising a technical rollover of the MINURSO mandate until 31 January 2004.Resolution 1495 also recommended the acceptance by all sides of the Baker II plan which has been drawn up by Mr. James A Baker, the personal envoy of the UN Secretary General, and formally presented by the Secretary General to the Security Council for its endorsement on 23 May 2003. The Baker II plan proposes a transitional period of four to five years during which Western Sahara would be self governing under Moroccan sovereignty. A Western Sahara authority, WSA, under a chief executive would be responsible for local government, internal security, law enforcement, the economy, welfare and education, while Morocco would be responsible for foreign relations, national security and defence. At the end of five years a referendum would be held giving residents a choice between independence, integration with Morocco or continued autonomy.Algeria and the Polisario front have indicated their willingness to explore these proposals. Morocco continues to reject them. United Nations efforts continue with the strong support of the Government.

The department of defence of the United States is at present refusing to either confirm or deny the reports. The establishment of responsible internal security and police forces in Iraq is an integral part of the transfer of sovereignty. As the only information available on the cited plan at present is unconfirmed media reports, I am unable to take a definite view without greater details.

The reduction of poverty, hunger and conflict in Africa are some of the most important tasks to which the international community can dedicate itself in the 21st century. These tasks can only be achieved when donors such as Ireland, the EU and others work hand in hand with United Nations agencies dedicated to relieving poverty, tackling famine and reducing conflict.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	523	A role for NATO on European security and defence policy, ESDP, arises from the need for the EU to have access to certain NATO assets and capabilities for crisis management purposes. Arrangements for co-operation between the two organisations have been envisaged since the early evolution of ESDP and have evolved in accordance with principles specified by successive European Councils since Feira 2000. Permanent arrangements to facilitate co-operation between the EU and NATO in the crisis management area, known as "Berlin Plus", were finalised in March 2003. These arrangements take full account of the distinct nature and structures of each organisation. The autonomy of EU decision-making and non-discrimination against any member state are underlying principles which have been of particular importance from Irelands perspective. The successful implementation of the "Berlin Plus" arrangements has been evidenced in the context of operation concordia, the EU-led military monitoring and stabilisation operation, conducted with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.Against this background, and while there is considerable overlap in terms of membership of both organisations, it can be seen that the EU and NATO remain separate and distinct entities. Close co-ordination between the two organisations on crisis management issues will be taken forward under the Irish Presidency in the context of planning for the EU take-over of the NATO-led SFOR operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is anticipated to occur towards the end of 2004.

For the past 17 years, northern Uganda has suffered from attacks by the rebel group Lord's Resistance Army, LRA, which has seen up to 20,000 children abducted by the LRA to act as child soldiers and sex slaves. These attacks have escalated dramatically in the past few months. The consequences for the Acholi people of the region have been devastating, with internal displacement of up to 80% of the people. The Ugandan Government's response is still predominantly focused on a military defeat of the LRA which has not been successful to date.The Government has condemned, and continues to condemn the appalling atrocities committed by the LRA. During President Museveni's recent visit to Ireland my colleague, Deputy Kitt, expressed to him our concern at the actions of the LRA and our deep sympathies for the people suffering under its insurgency. In October 2003, Development Co-operation Ireland approved funding of €500,000 for emergency feeding programs for internally displaced persons and refugees in northern and western Uganda.At a recent meeting in Kampala between the EU Troika and the Ugandan foreign minister, at which Ireland was represented, the EU condemned the human rights abuses perpetrated by the LRA and urged the Ugandan Government to also consider non-military solutions to resolve this terrible situation. To this end, the EU expressed support for the Acholi religious leaders peace initiative as an important channel of communication with the LRA.

An electoral commission has been established and the UN mission in Afghanistan, UNAMA, has started to organise the electoral process. Voter registration, under UNAMA auspices, began on 1 December in a number of provinces. A draft constitution was published by the ATA on 3 November. The draft establishes the centrality of Islam, observes the United Nations Charter, and respects the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It also provides for an office of president and a national assembly. The draft constitution will be debated, possibly amended, and ultimately approved by the Loya Jirga tribal council, which convened on 10 December, and is expected to continue for some weeks.

Ireland played its part in this initiative when it hosted a meeting of the eminent persons group appointed to report on dialogue among civilisations in Dublin on 30-31 May 2001. The work accomplished by that initiative has since been carried through in other fora.The EU has played its part in furthering dialogue. One specific initiative being undertaken by the EU is the Euro-Mediterranean foundation for a dialogue of cultures. One of the foundation's guiding principles notes that the values of dialogue, tolerance and respect for the other, which are common to all religions, constitute an important factor in bringing closer together cultures and civilisations.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 133 together.The Government aims to run an efficient, effective and impartial Presidency. The first half of 2004 presents particular challenges, and our preparations, including those for our Presidency programme, reflect this. Ireland will be the first Presidency to preside over the enlarged Union of 25 states when the new member states formally accede on 1 May 2004. The successful integration of the new members will be an important focus for our Presidency. We will also take forward work in relation to the further enlargement of the Union. The Union's agenda for economic, social and environmental renewal will be the focus for the spring European Council. We will be seeking to revitalise the process and give it greater dynamism as it approaches its crucial mid-term point.The focus in the Irish Presidency in the justice and home affairs area will be on the delivery of agreed commitments under the Amsterdam treaty which remain outstanding and the broader Tampere programme, as updated by subsequent European Councils. This will involve a wide ranging agenda including asylum, immigration, police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters and civil law co-operation. The Irish Presidency will also focus on operational co-operation and will place emphasis on the fight against drugs and organised crime and combating illegal immigration.

The wives of two of the prisoners have been attempting to acquire travel visas from the US authorities that would allow them visit their husbands in jail. The Irish Government has no official standing in this matter which is a bilateral consular issue between the Cuban and US authorities.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Conscious of the success of the sponsorship arrangements in recent Presidencies, and the fact that this has very much become the usual practice, the Government took the view that the Presidency offers a valuable and important opportunity for Irish business to promote what is best about Ireland, in particular in the economic, trade and tourism areas. The main role of the Presidency is to advance the agenda of the European Union but it is also accepted that each Presidency takes the opportunity to promote its own country widely. It would be remiss of the Government if we did not maximise the exposure that Ireland will gain from hosting the Presidency, which may well be the last of its kind. I also believe that sponsorship will help develop a wider ownership in, and involvement with, the Presidency.We have, in particular, modelled our approach on that applied by the very successful Danish Presidency by inviting offers of sponsorship from companies. All sponsorship will be in the form of goods and services. No cash sponsorship will be considered. There are a number of categories that particularly lend themselves to a sponsorship arrangement such as transportation, catering and the provision of IT-telecommunications equipment. Similar categories have been sponsored during previous Presidencies. In this context, my Department contacted the various umbrella groups for business in Ireland, such as the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, the Irish Hotel Federation and the Society of the Irish Motor Industry to outline the sponsorship possibilities.I am happy to inform the House that the following companies have agreed to become sponsors of the Presidency: Eircom, Audi, Tipperary Natural Spring Water and Kerrygold. Eircom and Audi between them will supply goods and services worth approximately €5 million. Tipperary Natural Spring Water will supply its product free of charge to all ministerial level meetings in Ireland and for the two summits in Brussels while Kerrygold will supply its products free of charge for every Presidency lunch and dinner in Ireland and in Brussels. Such is the interest in sponsoring the Presidency that negotiations are still ongoing with several similar high calibre companies. I am also encouraged by the inquiries from smaller regional companies and organisations who are interested in sponsoring events in their respective localities. I think this shows that the Presidency touches all parts of the country.

The position is that, in accordance with audit requirements, an out-of-date payable order is reissued where adequate checks can be carried out ensuring that a replacement payable order did not already issue. As this payable order is in excess of 14 years old the relevant records relating to it cannot be traced. Accordingly, my Department is not in a position to issue a replacement in this instance.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The term "ringfencing" can be used in the milk quota context to describe two different sets of rules. The first relates to the movement of quota from less favoured areas arising from the transfer of dairying lands and other concerns the distribution of milk in milk quota restructuring schemes.With land transfers, where land in an LFA to which quota attaches is transferred by way of sale, lease, gift or inheritance, only milk produced on the transferred farm or on other lands within 48 km of it can be delivered in respect of that quota, that is, the new quota holder cannot use the quota on lands more than 48 km away from the original holding. An exemption is available to a producer who sells his-her entire holding and buys a new holding more than 48 km away.The term ringfencing has also been used in the context of the restructuring scheme. This scheme is operated at co-operative level, according to detailed rules set each year by my Department. A primary condition of the scheme is that quota sold into the restructuring pool by any co-operatives suppliers is available for purchase by that co-operatives other suppliers only.I have no plans at the moment to change these arrangements.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I have placed a very high priority on improving Ireland's animal identification and traceability systems and I am determined to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control, and remains at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety. In the wake of the FMD crisis of 2001, and against a backdrop of earlier unsuccessful efforts in this regard, I introduced a comprehensive individual sheep identification system, the national sheep identification system or NSIS, which provides full individual identification and traceability of sheep from farm of origin to carcase and which is designed to be multi-functional, facilitating aspects such as flock management, consumer assurance and disease monitoring and control.In the latter regard, the FMD crisis underscored the potential damage to which our economy and the agriculture sector is exposed in the event of serious disease outbreaks if shortcomings in animal identification and traceability were not addressed. Based on monitoring of NSIS and feedback to my Department from various quarters since 2001, I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are now firmly bedded in across the sheep sector and working well. I have, however, made it clear that I am always willing to enhance and improve NSIS and to address any operational difficulties which might arise, while maintaining its key components.A new harmonised system of identification for the whole of the European Union has been proposed by the European Commission. The current proposals provide that there will be electronic individual identification of sheep from January 2008, together with a central movement database recording movements on a batch basis. The implementation date is subject to review following a Commission report in 2006. For the interim period it is proposed that all sheep be double tagged and identified individually, but that all recording would be on a flock basis.It is anticipated that the final form of the proposal, which the Italian Presidency is working to bring before the December Council of Agriculture Ministers, will afford member states which already have systems in place offering a higher level of traceability than would be the case under the "interim period" system the option of retaining their own systems until the advent of electronic identification in a few years from now.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	542	The proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of animals during transport is of great importance from the perspective of our live export trade. My Department shares many of the concerns voiced by the Irish Farmers Association and has met with its representatives as part of a consultation process with all stakeholders in the industry. The proposal has been discussed by chief veterinary officers and at working group level on several occasions since September 2003.I have signalled my concerns about dispensing with the use of staging posts at which animals may be offloaded and requiring them to rest on the transport vehicle; modifying the travel time-rest period cycle; reducing stocking densities, arising primarily from the requirement to rest animals on the transport vehicle; and standards being prescribed for seagoing vessels which do not meet the rigorous standards already laid down in Irish legislation. Discussions on all of these matters are continuing. While progress is being made on some aspects, agreement has yet to be achieved on several fundamental technical provisions.The proposal is unlikely to be finalised during the Italian Presidency. Instead, consideration of the dossier is expected to continue during the Irish Presidency and the European Parliament is not expected to outline its position before March 2004.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I have been pressing for the option of introducing mechanical grading for some time at EU level. This was finally agreed by the Commission earlier this year and machines were tested last month in factory conditions. The results of these tests will be available shortly. Given that mechanical grading is something which has been sought by the industry including factories and producers, I anticipate it will become the norm within the industry in the near future.Ireland and Portugal are unique amongst EU member states as the only countries that exclusively provide and finance an official carcase classification service in meat factories. The decision that the Department should withdraw from providing this service is based on the principle that a departmental permanent presence in meat plants should be confined to areas where regulatory responsibility is vested in it as the competent authority. The only regulatory responsibility arising for it in respect of carcase classification is of a supervisory nature and my Department will continue to carry out this function.Following withdrawal from carcase classification duties the staff concerned will carry out other necessary functions where there is a shortage of staff resources and agreement has been reached with the IMPACT trade union in relation to redeployment arrangements. In the meantime training of factory operatives, delivered free of charge by my Department, is currently in progress. This will enable factory operatives to be trained to the appropriate standard and enable them to provide continuity of service when the Department classifiers are withdrawn. At that stage my Department will provide intensive supervision of the grading process, in line with the systems operated in 13 other EU member states.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	544	With effect from 2005, the decoupled payment, to be known as the single payment scheme, is to be based on the average number of animals or the average number of hectares in the case of arable aid on which payments were made under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. The single payment is calculated by taking the three yearly average number of animals-arable hectares which attracted payment and multiplying them by the payment rate for 2002 in respect of livestock or by €383.04 per hectare in the case of arable aid. Entitlements are established by dividing this single payment amount by the average number of hectares declared on the area aid applications over the three-year periodFarmers for whom entitlements have been established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year. Under the European Council regulation, farmers must have an eligible hectare of land for each payment entitlement. However, farmers who activate only 80% of their entitlements in 2005 may sell the other 20% without land in 2006 if they so wish. Entitlements not activated in a three year period will revert to the national reserve.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I welcome the announcement made by my colleague the Minister for Finance in last week's budget to extend the leased land exemption which currently applied to farmers over the age of 55. This had been identified as a priority issue by the farm organisations as part of their pre-budget submissions. From 1 January next year the age limit is being lowered to 40 years and the rental income exemption limits are being increased from €5,079 to €7,500 per annum for leases between five and seven years and from €7,618 to €10,000 for leases of seven or more years.I welcome these improvements which will help improve land mobility and facilitate better long-term planning by farmers who may be required to scale-up production at a reasonable cost. It will be extremely helpful in the context of the implementation of the mid-term review decisions.

New embassies have since been established in Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia and Cyprus, and also in Brazil. We have recently opened offices in Sofia, Bulgaria and Bucharest, Romania to ensure the most effective management of our Presidency of the European Union in these two countries. The opening of additional missions will be kept under ongoing review, including in the context of the availability of resources.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I propose to take Questions Nos. 130, 137 and 138 together.The central objectives of the Irish programme of development co-operation are the reduction of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development. This includes meeting the basic human needs of some of the world's poorest people by improving their access to food, water, health services, sanitation, education and employment.The geographical focus of our bilateral programme is on a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region in the world. Development Co-operation Ireland provides long-term development assistance to six programme countries – Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia – as well as South Africa. Timor Leste is our only programme country outside this poor region. In line with other donors, the Irish programme operates in partnership with the governments of these countries and agrees strategies with them to ensure that Irish interventions respond effectively to their development needs. One aim, among others, is to help build up the capacity of these governments to manage their own affairs, which in turn strengthens their sense of ownership of the whole development process.A robust system for oversight and accountability is required in an environment of dire poverty and the corruption usually associated with it. Development Co-operation Ireland provides this through a rigorous system of evaluation, monitoring and audit in all our country programmes. All accounts and expenditure are audited. There is a strong, comprehensive monitoring process, involving close co-ordination with other donors, which acts as a quality control on the programme. The evaluation approach allows for a forensic examination of interventions to measure effectiveness and identify lessons learned. These systems are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary. The effect of all of these safeguards is that our bilateral aid reaches those for whom it is intended.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The Government's official programme of development assistance, Development Co-operation Ireland, focuses its aid on the poorest people in the poorest countries. The recent OECD development assistance committee's review of Ireland's aid programme commended the fact that Ireland gives a higher share of its ODA to least developed countries than any other donor.At the international level, Ireland actively promotes a concentration of development aid on the poorest countries, almost all of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. At the United Nations, Ireland promotes an increase in the funding disbursed by the UN funds and programmes to the poorest countries. Through our membership of the executive boards of the UN development programme, UNDP, and UNICEF, we have actively argued the case that the resource allocation criteria, used by the funds and programmes to determine the level of their aid to countries in need, should explicitly favour the 49 least developed countries.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-11 00:00:00	Prelude	558	The EU is greatly concerned about the further deterioration of the political situation in Zimbabwe. In February 2003, the EU's common position on Zimbabwe noted the degradation of the political situation in that country. The common position renewed sanctions on those individuals whom the EU deemed most responsible for the violation of human rights. Also in February the EU issued a declaration expressing its concern at the detailed instances of arbitrary arrests and inhumane treatment of opposition members and civil society organisers and called on the government of Zimbabwe to engage in meaningful dialogue with the opposition.However, the EU is not pursuing a policy of isolation with Zimbabwe. A series of benchmarks for the government of Zimbabwe to meet has been outlined by the EU. Progress along the lines of the established benchmarks could lead to a normalisation of relations between the EU and Zimbabwe. Among the short-term benchmarks identified were an end to political intimidation and violence and the restoration of democratic values and respect for human rights. Medium term measures to be undertaken by the government of Zimbabwe include introducing a number of proposals to parliament to redress current restrictions on freedom of expression and association.

Any future proposals for overseas deployment by the Permanent Defence Force, including those carried out under the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, will remain subject to a Government decision and will continue to require UN authorisation for the mission in question. In addition, a resolution by Dáil Éireann is required where the proposed number for deployment of Irish personnel exceeds 12. These conditions are set out in the Defence Acts and were reflected in the national declaration made by Ireland at the Seville European Council in June 2002, in advance of the referendum on the Nice Treaty held in October of that year.Assessment of any such proposal would also need to take into account the numbers of Permanent Defence Force personnel available for overseas service at that time.

In June 2001 my Department issued a circular letter to the management authorities of second level schools advising them of the procedure to follow as regards the installation of dust extraction systems. The process of installing dust extraction systems and the associated process of upgrading machinery in woodwork rooms in second level schools is the responsibility of the school's management authorities.The programme to control airborne dust levels in woodwork rooms commenced in 2002. This programme is ongoing and will continue in 2004. I intend to publish details of the 2004 school building programme by early January at the latest. The programme will clarify the level of finance available for remediation programmes, including dust extraction, during 2004.

Section 4 of the Act enables additional institutions that are identified as reformatory schools, industrial schools, orphanages, children's homes and special schools, in respect of which a public body had a regulatory or inspection function, to be added to the Schedule.My Department has received correspondence from both individuals and survivor groups identifying a number of additional institutions, including Mary Immaculate School for Deaf Infant Boys, Beechpark, Stillorgan, Dublin, that may be eligible for inclusion in the Schedule. Discussions have taken place between my Department and other Departments that may have provided a regulatory function in the operation of these facilities in order to ascertain whether these institutions are eligible for inclusion. The initial information received in some cases was scant due to the long period that had elapsed since these institutions were closed and, therefore, the process of verifying each of these institutions has been time consuming. It is my intention that a list of additional institutions will be brought before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as the verification process is completed.

The first phase of this project is designed to increase train lengths from six to eight cars, by lengthening and upgrading station platforms throughout the DART system. This work is currently in hand and, when completed at the end of 2005, will provide a 30% increase in passenger handling over present capacity.The company will then immediately move on to phase 2. The city centre area is a bottleneck in the DART and outer suburban network. This second phase is designed to overcome this by resignalling the area in question. The upgraded signalling will allow for an increase in train frequency, from a present maximum of 12 train movements per hour/per direction to 16. This will give a further 30% increase in passenger handling over phase 1.The works have been scheduled in their present format not only to cause the least possible disruption to the travelling public but also to maximize the efficient use of the company's resources in terms of equipment and technical expertise. Irish Rail informs me that it will exploit any possibility to reduce the timescales of the overall project should such possibilities present themselves.

However, where airbags are installed in new vehicles, they must conform with the technical specifications laid down in Directive 96/79/EC as amended by Directive 1999/98/EC on the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a frontal impact.Under article 34 of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963, a vehicle for use in a public place must, together with all of its parts and equipment, be maintained in good and efficient working order. Under this provision there is, therefore, an onus on the owner of a vehicle to have airbags replaced where they have been activated.

The Registry of Deeds, which forms part of the overall organisation, is based in a fifth location. The various offices operate seamlessly as one homogenous unit and none is singled out for separate mention in the annual report unless something unique to that office or region happened during a particular year.The annual report for the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds is a summary on the main activities of the organisation during 2002. The annual report focuses on reporting how the organisation performed on the high level objectives agreed for the organisation and published in the organisation's Statement of Strategy and Business Plan 2002 – 2005. This approach has been acknowledged as desirable and logical, that is, organisations consult widely among stakeholders, customers and staff prior to publishing their business strategy and then regularly report on progress.Internally within the organisation, each section and division prepares its own strategy for the year and regularly reports on progress. A general review is undertaken at the end of the year in the annual report. The Deputy will have noted from the annual report that 2002 was a year in which the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds performed very well.

The overall project has evolved over a number of stages, following the acquisition of the lands for the national park itself over the years 1993-1998.Some €3.81m was allocated in respect of the project under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. To date, €421,000 has been spent on design fees and on the purchase, in March 2001, of a site for the centre. The project is being managed by my Department with the assistance of a working group, comprising representatives of local community and tourism groups, Mayo County Council, the Office of Public Works and of my Department.

Where an employee of the agency becomes a member of a local authority, he or she is released on unpaid special leave for the period of membership.A person who is for the time being a member of a local authority is disqualified from becoming the director general or a director of the EPA or an employee of the agency. Section 11(5) of the Radiological Protection Act 1991 provides that the chief executive officer of the Radiological Protection Institute shall not hold any other office or position without the consent of the institute. The terms and conditions of employment of other employees are determined by the institute and they cannot take up other duties without the approval of the institute.It is not proposed to amend these provisions. Relevant criteria for civil servants, including staff of the Meteorological Service and the Central Statistics Office, are a matter for the Minister for Finance.

The current standard for this is set out in recommendation SR6:1991, which was drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland and which was issued by the Department by way of circular letter to each planning authority on 8 January 1992.Recommendation SR6 indicates that septic tanks should be located not nearer than seven metres from the dwelling served and should not be nearer than 20 metres from the nearest point of any other dwelling.The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has published a draft, Manual on Treatment Systems for Single Houses in 2000, which was designed to help planning authorities, builders and others to deal with the complexities of on-site systems, including packaged systems. The EPA is currently reviewing the draft manual in the light of comments received from interested parties. My intention is to call up the revised EPA manual, when available, in "Technical Guidance Document H – Drainage and Waste Water Disposal", on the national building regulations. I also understand that the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, intends at that stage to withdraw SR6: 1991 in favour of the revised manual.

A spouse is regarded as being "wholly or mainly maintained" where she-he does not have income in his-her own right above a certain limit. This limit is currently €203.16 a week –€210 per week from January 2004. The spouse or partner's income includes income from employment, self employment, income from other sources such as rents from the letting of property, income from occupational pensions and foreign social security payments as well as income from capital.Under present arrangements, assuming that the spouse-partner has no other means, capital of €52,059.27 or less will give entitlement to the full rate of QAA. Capital of €52,059.28 to €79,993.55 will give entitlement to a reduced rate of QAA. The latter amount of capital will increase to €81,263.29 with effect from January 2004.Where capital is in joint names, for example in the names of both the pensioner and the spouse, both parties are the legal owners of the capital. As a result, my Department, in such cases, assesses half the capital against each. In the event of any changes in the amount of capital held by the spouse or partner, either jointly or singly, entitlement to a QAA payment will be reassessed on request.I consider that the present arrangements are reasonable in the circumstances and there are no plans to change them.

The list is updated from time to time and in order to establish the current number of persons who are still seeking a transfer to Carlow it would be necessary to contact them individually. There are no formal transfer arrangements in place for other grades.
