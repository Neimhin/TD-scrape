          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_1">We welcome the publication yesterday of the personal insolvency Bill and are gratified that it takes on board many of the suggestions we made in the legislation we brought before the Oireachtas before Christmas.  It shows that this Oireachtas can really work if everybody is given an opportunity to have an input into legislation.  However, we are concerned about the proposals in that it leaves the involvement of the banks in respect of secure debt as optional.  Our proposal was radically different in that regard.  It is fair to say that the Tánaiste pointed out many times in the past four years that leaving issues to the discretion of the banks is a bad idea but effectively what we are getting in these proposals is light touch legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_2">The Government is putting the code of practice into legislation but it is not giving it teeth, so to speak.  I ask the Tánaiste to reconsider that matter.  Will it introduce amendments to strengthen the Bill, particularly in respect of secured creditors and home loans?</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I asked the Tánaiste a question last week about the interest rates ITSB is charging.  Effectively, it is twice the rate charged by AIB and it is having a major effect on mortgage holders.  Has any progress been made in resolving what is a straightforward issue in that it is basically a State owned bank?  Similarly, it has been brought to my attention that regarding the EBS, which is now owned by AIB and is one of the Minister, Deputy Noonan's, pillar banks, the idea was to get some form of convergence.  What steps does the Government intend to take to ensure there is convergence in the interest rate being charged on home loans by the EBS towards the AIB rate?  I would point out that ITSB issues new house loans at a lower rate than those in respect of existing mortgage holders.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_3">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for welcoming the publication yesterday of the personal insolvency Bill.  It is a pity he took some of the good out of the welcome by making some begrudging comments in respect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">It is fair to say that the biggest worry in the period of this recession for individuals and families, even bigger than the loss of the job or the loss of the business, is the fear of losing their home.  I refer to people who have found themselves in mortgage difficulties and in circumstances of personal debt of one kind or another.  That issue has been addressed by the Government in the publication of the personal insolvency legislation yesterday, which is the most radical reform of personal insolvency legislation we have seen.  I remind Deputy Ó Cuív that his party had 14 years in Government in which to address this issue and did not address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The Government has addressed the issue of personal insolvency and introduced legislation which will reduce the period to three years.  That alone will strengthen the hand of borrowers in their discussions with their banks.  The legislation provides for a range of non-judicial debt settlement arrangements, provision for a debt relief certificate for people who have unsecured debt of under €20,000 with no income and no assets, debt settlement arrangements where people can make a settlement with their bank and, critically, the introduction of the personal insolvency arrangement, which includes secure debt and will include also mortgage debt.  For the first time we will have legislation that will enable borrowers to negotiate debt settlement arrangements in a realistic and reasonable way with their banks and their financial institutions.  It is a good day for this country that for the first time we now have hope for families and households in that they can see a way to working themselves out of their personal debt circumstances.  Interestingly, this comes on a day when as a country we have seen the first signs of hope regarding our re-entry to the markets with the bond exchange yesterday, which is the first time the country has been back in the markets since September 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">This is a very positive development.  The intention is that the heads of the Bill will be discussed in the joint Oireachtas committee and any improvements Members of the House wish to suggest or detail they want to discuss can be discussed in that committee.  The Bill then will be formally published and I hope it will be enacted in a relatively short period.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_8">The Tánaiste is a radically changed man in the past year and a half because what happened yesterday was that the European Central Bank lent money to the banks at 1.5% which have lent it to Ireland at 5%, making a substantial gain because of the arrangement in the ECB.  I compliment the NTMA on availing of the opportunity but the basic structure is wrong given that the big gains are for the private banks.  However, that is another day's work.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_10">We welcome the Bill.  An issue the Tánaiste spoke about before coming into Government was interacting with the House and taking on board good suggestions no matter where they came from.  The Bill proposes that the banks, in respect of the biggest loan that most people have, that is, the secured loan that is the mortgage on their house, are not forced to get involved in debt resolution, and that it is an option for them.  As we are aware from the past, when the banks have options, they do not always take those options in the interests of the customer.  It should be mandatory on the banks, as it is for the unsecured creditors, to get involved.  That is the fundamental change needed to make the Bill effective.  If not, it will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said yesterday that he was hoping for the co-operation of the banks.  The Tánaiste was critical of the lack of co-operation from the banks throughout the fiscal crisis and the fact that they would not tell us how badly they were scorched.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
          <p eId="para_13">I have a question.  I would have thought that the Tánaiste, above all people, would have realised that depending on the voluntary goodwill of the banks is a foolish way to go.  Will the Tánaiste amend the Bill to make it mandatory for the banks to engage?  In respect of the bankruptcy issue, debt resolution should ensure that bankruptcy will not be the option for the majority of ordinary citizens and that resolution will be the option.</p>

          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_21">The Government is always open to taking on board constructive suggestions from any Member on legislation.  That is why we have decided that the heads of the Bill will go immediately to the joint committee.  We do not intend that to be a prolonged period and we are looking at having that process completed by the end of February and then moving ahead with the formal publication of the legislation thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Deputy Ó Cuív refers to radical change.  This is radical change.  There is no other legislative arrangement of this kind of which I am aware.  Certainly there has been none in Ireland to date, nor is there any anywhere else of which I am aware that deals with the issue of secured debt in the way it is proposed to be dealt with in this legislation.  This is not some kind of a voluntary optional arrangement for banks.  This is legislation that is writing into law for the first time a range of non-judicial debt settlement arrangements which will give a reasonable prospect to people who have accumulated debts, who have mortgage debt they cannot pay, who are in negative equity and who face the awful prospect at some stage of losing their home of navigating and negotiating their way out of that situation.  The banks will know that as a backstop, the new completely changed personal insolvency arrangement, incorporating a reduction to three years, is in place.  This is radical new legislation which will provide a new basis on which people can work their way out of personal debt, including mortgage debt.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">-----and people have been facing all kinds of difficulties in respect of jobs, the economy and their personal situation.  For the first time since the country went into recession, individual families and households can look to a legislative basis through which they can get debt resolution and to a new legislative basis for personal insolvency which combined will give them some hope of getting out of the debt with which they are saddled .  In fairness to Deputy Ó Cuív, he has welcomed the publication of the legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_19">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald</from>
          <p eId="para_26">Today the Tánaiste intends ramming the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011, or the septic tank Bill as it is known, through the House, a measure that will impose great hardship on citizens.  The use of the guillotine to rush this measure through is cynical.  The Tánaiste said he was open to constructive suggestions in respect of any proposals, but in this case he is rushing the legislation through without having taken or considered the very constructive and fair amendments tabled by Members.  I am aware that what is happening today stems from a failure of successive Governments involving Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party to comply with the 1975 EU directive.  Unfortunately, what the Dáil is telling rural Ireland today is that it is the people who will pay for the failure of politics.  This legislation should not go through without the full standards by which septic tanks will be assessed being agreed, published and understood, because in its absence, fear and panic has spread throughout rural Ireland.</p>

Now, there is a 3 February deadline within which the Water Services (Amendment) Bill must be enacted.  The country is facing possible fines, including a lump sum penalty of €2.7 million and a daily fine of more than €26,000 if the legislation is not enacted and a way to deal with septic tanks is not found.</p>

The registration fee is not what is causing the difficulty.  The problem lies with the legislation the Government is rushing through.  The Government has failed to accept amendments from Sinn Féin and others.  The legislation is explicit that a fine of up to €5,000 can be levied.  There can be no fudging on this as it is there in black and white.  However, it is the absence of a series of standards for septic tanks that causes deep concern, as well as the fact that, should a household be faced with undertaking significant works to bring a septic tank up to standard, the Government is making no commitment to families the length and breadth of the country that there will be a helping hand for them.</p>

However, I put it to the Tánaiste that it is deeply unfair of the Government to put through this legislation without being absolutely clear on what standards will be applied.  Will there be a grants scheme?  Will there be assistance for families where in order to protect the water table and the quality of water they must upgrade their system?  The least those living in rural Ireland should expect from the Government is help and assistance in this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">In recent days press reports on briefings given by the Minister for Social Protection and senior officials in her Department have pointed to the beginning of a campaign to exert pressure on and harass unemployed people.  Apparently, the Minister is to unveil next week a programme entitled, Pathways to Work.  It has been stated every unemployed person in the State will be given a date by which he or she will be expected to be off the live register.  This is referred to in a sinister turn of phrase as the "prediction of exit date", something one might associate more with sentencing in a capital trial rather than with how people who find themselves in difficult circumstances should be treated.  If the unemployed person is not off the live register by that date, he or she will face what has been referred to as a "challenging interview".  Apparently, senior officials in the Department are referring to this among themselves as "Operation Transformation", a reference to an RTE project as part of which people who consider themselves to be overweight or seriously obese undertake a stringent programme to overcome the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">We have been told in the same briefings that the Minister's drive will include calling unemployed people to Alcoholics Anonymous-style motivation meetings if they do not meet their exit dates.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">The criminal profiteering and greed of a tiny minority of people in this State led to a catastrophic collapse in economic activity over the past three and a half years.  Hundreds of thousands of innocent people lost their jobs.  The disastrous austerity policies of this Government and its predecessor have kept hundreds of thousands of people on the dole, unfortunately.  Are they to be regarded as having a serious dependency disease, of which they have to be cured?  Will the cure involve humiliating and harassing them and making it intolerable for them to come to get their weekly support?  Is this how far the Labour Party has fallen in less than a year?  Before last year's general election, it published extensive documents claiming it would be the champion of the jobless and the powerhouse of job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">In the same week that the perpetrators of this crisis - the speculating bondholders - have been rewarded to the tune of €1.25 billion, it has been revealed that a Labour Party Minister is planning the institutionalised victimisation of the very victims of this crisis.  Those precious resources should be used to create emergency programmes of work for unemployed people.  We have been told this is being pushed by the troika, which makes sense.  The idea of an army of unemployed people in the peripheral countries of Europe competing with each other to be forced into dreadfully paying jobs, thereby driving down wages and conditions, is part of the troika's programme.  That is the pitiless strategy of capitalism.  Can the Tánaiste explain why the Labour Party, which was founded by the great champions of the victims - Connolly, Larkin and others - intends to participate in the classic Tory ploy of victimising and blaming the unemployed, who are the victims of this crisis?</p>

          <p eId="para_109">The Government's approach to people who are out of work is to assist them with training and education.  We help them to find job experience and internships, where appropriate.  That will enable them to work themselves back into employment as jobs become available.  The Government has no intention of allowing people to languish on unemployment payments without taking active measures to help them to return into employment and improve their skills.  In fact, the OECD has criticised the performance of previous Governments in this respect.  Deputy Higgins seems to have an absolute fascination with the Minister, Deputy Burton.  I presume it is because he shares a constituency with her.  The approach being led by the Minister is about reforming our social welfare system so that rather than being left in long-term unemployment, people are enabled to get back into employment as quickly as possible.  Her proposals and reforms will be set out in a strategy document, Pathways to Work, which is to be published shortly.  A range of activation measures will help people to re-equip themselves for the workforce and get retraining, where appropriate.  The interviews mentioned by Deputy Higgins are necessary because people have individual needs.  Unemployed people are not statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">We are not talking about percentages - we are talking about people.  Individual people have different needs, depending on where they previously worked and their levels of education and experience.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is putting in place a new regime whereby individual people who are out of work will be talked with individually.  Their needs, requirements and wishes will be established.  Our State training, education and labour activation systems will be used to help them to improve themselves while they are out of work.

          <p eId="para_111">There is one cure for mass unemployment.  That is job creation.  The Government needs to discontinue its austerity policies, which are destroying tens of thousands of jobs in the domestic economy.  That approach is the reason an additional 200,000 people are on the live register, compared to three and a half years ago.  The creation of real jobs with decent wages is the answer to unemployment.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">Unfortunately, the relentless loss of jobs in the domestic economy will continue as a result of the Government's policies.  In response to a question asked by my colleague, Deputy Daly, the Minister for Social Protection said it is expected that there will be an additional 45,200 net redundancies this year, unfortunately.  The Minister added that there will be a further 40,000 redundancies in 2013.  Incredibly, the Department of Social Protection is making money available to community employment schemes to provide for the redundancy of community employment workers.  How does that square with the Tánaiste's pronouncements on everything the Government will do for the unemployed?  I advise the Tánaiste and the Labour Party to be careful about where they are going with this.  Perhaps the Tánaiste should pass that advice on to the Minister, Deputy Burton.

It is coming close to the surface.  They did not dare to use such headlines over the past three years because it was clear who are the culprits and who are the victims.  Perhaps they think such headlines can be used again now.  Does the Tánaiste want the Labour Party to be responsible for that as a consequence of its focus on so-called labour activation measures, which really involve blaming and harassing the unemployed rather than creating real jobs?  At the end of March, the Government will pay €3 billion in respect of Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  I suggest that money should be invested in emergency programmes that encourage job creation and improve infrastructure.  One such programme could involve the remediation of septic tanks in rural areas.  That would bring thousands of people into work.  Such an approach is the cure for unemployment.</p>

For the information of Deputy Higgins, this means we have to attract investment into the country and that investment would certainly not be attracted into this country if we were to pursue the idiotic economic policies the Deputy advocates we should pursue.  We must have our economic situation managed in a way that attracts investment into the country, that restores confidence to the domestic economy and that grows jobs.  That is the Government's strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">As Deputy Higgins and everybody will be aware, we have a very significant level of unemployment which is far too high with 440,000 people on the live register.  We want to get that figure down.  Everybody, bar Deputy Higgins, perhaps, realises that this cannot be achieved simply by waving a manifesto at it.  Rather, it must be done over a period.  People who are out of work, who have lost their jobs, and some of whom have been out of work for a some time, have real needs which need to be addressed.  The Government does not intend to leave people who are unemployed aside without addressing their needs.  This is the reason for our approach which is aimed at equipping them with new skills.  People have different needs and they want to change career.  There are budgets available to training and education bodies for all these areas.  The Minister, Deputy Burton's budget for labour activation measures will be increased by about €100 million this year so that we can deal more effectively and fairly and appropriately with the needs of people who are unemployed.  In case Deputy Higgins has any doubt about it, we will be clear about two issues: first, the Government's priority is creation of jobs, growing of our economy and getting people back to work; second, we wish to deal-----</p>

I suggest that No. 16 could be deferred until next week because I know the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, is happy enough to adjourn the discussion on intercountry adoptions to allow greater time for it.  There is sufficient time next week and the following week because it has been indicated there is not a significant amount of legislation available to be discussed next week.  It might be more suitable to discuss No. 16 next week and in that way comply with the timeframe within which the Minister has said the Water Services (Amendment) Bill must be passed by the House.

There were answers that the Tánaiste did not give this morning with regard to whether there would be public investment to assist people in rural areas with their water and sewerage remediation programmes in the same way as the urban areas were given assistance from central taxation.

          <p eId="para_169">Like other speakers I congratulate the Government on the proposed personal insolvency legislation.  As it is promised legislation and as a result of the wide implications and importance of it, I ask that Committee Stage take place in plenary session of the House.  That is notwithstanding the preliminary discussions by the relevant committee.  It will affect a great many people.  Another issue that will affect many people is the housing Bill proposed to rationalise the housing agencies and change some of the systems that have or have not been in operation for the past number of years.</p>

We hope the consideration of the heads of the Bill by the Oireachtas committee might facilitate earlier passage of the legislation and it may not be necessary to have a very protracted Committee Stage if the heads of the Bill have already been considered by the committee.  We are anxious to get it enacted and we should bear that in mind.  I will factor in the request to have Committee Stage in the Chamber.  The housing legislation will be later this year.</p>

The reason we published it this week was the mood music coming from Government on the proposed sale of State assets.

          <p eId="para_200">People in rural areas have already registered when they apply for planning permission.  Local authorities have mapping systems for every rural house within their jurisdiction and functional area.  The dots are on the maps.  Local authorities know which houses are connected to septic tanks and mains sewers.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Minister took me to task on the army of inspectors.  He began to refer to other kinds of armies.  The fact is that 70E provides for a cohort, army of inspectors, or whatever one likes to call them, to be licensed by the EPA.  The point that Sinn Féin made to the Minister is that we already have technicians in local authorities with engineering qualifications.  Many of them are now under-employed in that local authorities do not have much capital work ongoing currently.  There are very few new capital works going on in water services or sanitary services or any kind of major civil engineering works.  Those staff are part of the local authority structure and they are qualified and available.  Those people could now be used to inspect septic tanks taking a risk-based approach, which we support, in particular in areas where there is a high risk of pollution and where water sources must be protected.  Technicians could give advice and support to rural householders instead of creating a new army of inspectors to do the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">A substantial number of people will carry out inspections.  If the Minister provides for the appointment of inspectors by the EPA, they may not be as sensitive to local conditions and needs or even the people or community they are dealing with as local authority technicians or engineers.  Local authorities have a good record of dealing with people within their own functional area.  That needs to be considered.  It is a pity that the Government is setting out to create a completely new regime under the jurisdiction of the EPA.  Local authority technicians could work under the EPA.  Local authorities are governed currently by EPA regulations and standards which provides a perfect fit without creating new positions or putting an extra burden on the Exchequer or rural householders.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I urge the Minister to amend the fee, which is unnecessary.  It sets a precedent and is the thin end of a thick wedge.  All legislation can be changed.  We have seen previously what happens when Governments, in particular those with a large majority, such as is the case with the Government which fills two thirds of the House, are in a position to push through legislation and to change the requirements.</p>

The Minister has made vague references to what he might do.  He said he will examine the matter in 2013.  The issue is causing huge concern.  If people do not have the wherewithal to upgrade, the issue of grants will concern them.  The Government has used the National Pensions Reserve Fund to bail out the banks and so on.  We should look to the European Investment Bank which loans money at low interest rates and wants to invest in small and large infrastructural projects.  Its funding could stimulate local building industries, while helping householders, local authorities and the Government to sort out the problem of pollution in rural areas.</p>

The Department has designed an online payments system and a manual form for those who wish to pay over the counter.  I am sure it has engaged consultants and incurred significant costs in designing a system to collect the €100 charge from 1.6 million households.  Every household with a septic tank will need to pay the household charge.  In the Department's wisdom and the spirit of promoting leaner government and the more efficient delivery of public services, why did it not design a dual system?</p>

          <p eId="para_225">The Acting Chairman also knows it, since people are attending his clinics also.  We do not know what we are voting for.  I have not been a Member for long, but I have been berated for previous legislation.  This Bill is loose, as it sets no standards.  Amendment No. 1 could have dealt with everything, as we would then have known what the standards and regulations would be.  There would have been a sense of fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I understand the Government's position and that it inherited this legislation from previous Governments, but we are where we are.  People must be made to comply.  It cannot be stated strongly enough that every politician and 99.9% of rural and urban dwellers want clean water, to which they have a constitutional right.  People who have their own system paid a great deal of money to install and maintain it to a high standard.  If systems give trouble, they are normally in close proximity to houses.  They were much closer prior to the regulations being introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The kernel of the issue is regulation.  However, no one knows what an inspection will entail.  I have spoken with my county council.  I am sure the Acting Chairman has also.  It knows nothing about the matter.  It is not ignorant, but it does not know whether it will police this issue.  Last night the Minister stated inspections would be carried out primarily by county council officials.  That is welcome, as the Minister can speak with most of the people involved.  However, it is not welcome that an inspector's opinion will be enough to deem a system faulty.  An amendment in my name addressed the phrase "likely to constitute a risk".  If the inspector's opinion is that a system is faulty, he or she will give the householder a piece of paper on the day or subsequently describing the works to be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">I welcome that the Minister has extended the period involved.  I accept that we have made progress with the Bill, but if a householder is not happy with an inspector's opinion, the private engineer or assessor he or she will ask to inspect the system might deem it to be okay.  This happens constantly.  Tomorrow I will bring clients and their agents to meet senior planning officials and there will be healthy arguments and debates.  If the pre-planning meetings do not go well, the agents and I - they are more technically qualified in their areas than I am - will reassess, seek further advice and might revert to the officials.  We work with the county council to try to secure the best outcome for the constituent within the proper planning guidelines.  Unfortunately, we are discussing the 2009 regulations.</p>

The question of percolation will be involved, but the meetings will mainly have to do with planning issues.  Percolation systems must meet the 2009 guidelines, not the SR6.  We cannot work around it.  If it fails, there is no debate and one must move site, expand the existing site and so on.  Under the Bill, one will have to take the opinion of the council official.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I welcome wholeheartedly the fact that the Minister has reduced the charge for an appeal from €200 to €20.  One must appeal to the same local authority which will send another inspector, but inspectors are unlikely to go against their own.  That is the nature of it.  They will work in the same offices, be they the council's environment office, which is more than likely, or the environment and planning offices.  According to the Minister, no planning offices will be involved.  We will wait and see what is contained in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">I will.  People do not know who I am talking about.  If a householder is not happy with an evaluation, he or she must go to the District Court.  This provision is anathema.  Most country people never go to court.  If they do, it is to face speeding fines, pollution charges, a charge of failing to cut hedges or animals trespassing or other little silly matters.  Someone would need to be charged with breaking the law or, for example, requesting a public service vehicle, PSV, or liquor licence.  Making people go to the District Court could involve open-ended costs.  There is no point, therefore, in discussing a charge of €20 or €200.  Someone might need to seek assistance.  I am not blaming solicitors, although the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011 is before the House.  A person might need to engage a junior counsel and, if he or she felt strongly enough about the issue, a senior counsel.  He or she might need to move from the District Court to the Circuit Court and, possibly, the High Court or even farther.  No one has considered this gravy train.  Apart from the question of standards and the cost of upgrades, this is the elephant in the room.  It is a serious issue which should be debated as calmly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I will conclude, as the Acting Chairman has been lenient.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">A point was made by the Taoiseach yesterday morning and the Tánaiste this morning to the effect that the debate on Committee Stage finished early last week.  No one can deny this, given the number of hours allotted.  As I told the Minister yesterday, when the Vice Chairman of the committee returned to the meeting after dinner last week, having apparently received advice on the matter, he ruled out several amendments on the basis that they might involve a charge on the Exchequer.  Likewise, I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle yesterday morning indicating that my Report Stage amendment No. 36 was ruled out of order on the same basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_241">Yes.  The Minister assures us that people will not experience any financial hardship as a consequence of these provisions.  Yet the letter I had from the Ceann Comhairle was concerned with reminding me that amendments must be ruled out of order where there is a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Those two positions do not marry.  The Ceann Comhairle did not make up the content of that letter; he got it from the Department or whoever advises on these matters.  Likewise, my colleague, Deputy Noel Coonan, as Vice Chairman of the committee, was acting on advice when he came in after dinner last week and read out a list of amendments which were ruled out of order.  That is part of the reason the Committee Stage debate finished early.</p>

The reason I was there so late was the time it took to deal with all of the queries I received in respect of yesterday's debate on this legislation.  I thank the Minister for his attendance in the Chamber all day yesterday, but I am terribly disappointed with the answers we received from him.  I said yesterday that he ought to have a new title of Minister for confusion.  The queries I dealt with late into the night were from people who were closely monitoring the debate and tuned into every word the Minister said.  What came up again and again was that we were not provided with answers.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">I am well aware of its seriousness.  Where are the rural Deputies who will support the Government on this proposal today?  They too should appreciate its seriousness.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I am glad the Acting Chairman reminded me that the reason we are in such a rush today is that the Government is guillotining the debate.  That is a disgrace.  The Acting Chairman has pointed out how serious these proposals are.  Yet the Government is guillotining the debate at 1.30 p.m.  I was pleased that Deputy Mary Lou McDonald used her time this morning to try to get the answers from the Tánaiste which we failed to get from the Minister yesterday.  Unfortunately, she did not succeed.  When Deputy Martin Ferris sought answers, as he was perfectly entitled to do, he ended up being thrown out of the Chamber.  That too is disgraceful.  We are all here to represent the people who voted for us and we are merely seeking answers on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">I hope, even at this late hour, that the Minister might have a change of heart and inform the people of the information we are seeking on their behalf.  I thanked him on Committee Stage for providing an answer to my question in regard to the registration fee, which, we are told, will be a once-off charge of €50.  However, nobody knows who will be in what position next week, never mind in several years' time.  How can the Minister assure the people that there will be no requirement to re-register and no additional fee?  Once the system of registration is in place, by way of this legislation, who can say that an additional financial burden will not be imposed on people in the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The Minister did not answer our questions in regard to the inspection standards that will apply.  It is not good enough for him to say that tanks must be working.  He may not be in control at a future date when some new directive dictates that a new, higher standard will apply.  The Minister or his successor - whoever is in office at the time - might have absolutely no say in the matter.  By forcing people to register now and to reach a standard that is not yet defined, the Minister is opening them up to being slapped with higher charges at any time in the future.  We have seen EU regulations being foisted upon us and Governments putting up their hands and saying there is no choice in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">In regard to the guillotining of the debate, we were initially told that, in the absence of this legislation, the State would be subject to fines from the beginning of February.  Thanks to Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív and those working with him - we did not find it out from the Government - we now know that the Commission has clearly stated that the fines will not kick in until the summer.  As such, there is no reason that the debate must be guillotined today.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">These are the issues of concern to people.  If the Minister thinks he did a proper job yesterday and gave adequate information in response to the questions he was asked, he is greatly mistaken.  I ask him again to tell the people the facts and exactly what is proposed by way of the provisions that will be railroaded through later today.  He has failed in an extraordinary fashion to do so.  A person of his experience should realise that it is much easier to answer a question at the beginning rather than fudging the issue and engaging in bluff and bluster.  He should have set out the facts months ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I am around a long time and so is the Minister.  As an example of what is likely to happen, I remember well the introduction of refuse charges in south Tipperary.  I was at the council meeting where they were introduced and where I voted against them.  In the course of that debate a Fianna Fáil Party councillor stood up, took a box of matches from his pocket and threw it across the table at me, saying that the charges amounted only to the cost of one box of matches per week.  This €50 registration charge probably equates to the price of a box of matches per week too, but the point is that the refuse charges soon increased way beyond that level.  Most ordinary families with two or three children were soon paying €400 to local authorities, and they will pay a great deal more under the privatised system now in place in most counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The suggestion that this is a once-off charge is all talk.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">We know what happens in these situations.  This small fee will increase over time until it becomes the €300 proposed by Fianna Fáil.  It will become part of a suite of charges payable in the main by low and middle income families who are already hard pressed, many of whom are unemployed.  As in the case of the household charge, there will be no waiver for old age pensioners, social welfare recipients or people with huge mortgages.  Ordinary families will be crucified by having to pay a whole suite of charges, including this one.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Let us not pretend this charge is a one-off.  The Government should tell the truth in this regard.  While this charge is currently set at a low rate it will increase to a substantial amount payable by ordinary people who are already paying for a crisis, the creation of which they had no hand, act or part in.</p>

          <from>Deputy Luke ‘Ming’ Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_263">Like the previous speaker, I do not agree with the introduction of this fee.  This is supposed to be about ensuring we have clean water rather than gathering more finance to be wasted by local authorities, which authorities are totally and utterly unaccountable.  If one tries to make them accountable, one gets a slap on the wrist in the form of non-improvement of roads and so on.  It is definitely not a system in which I believe another €50 or even a single red cent should be invested.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The more I listen to the Minister, the clearer it becomes that this is not about clean water, in particular when it comes to the collection of money likely to be spent on daft projects.  If this was about clean water, the Minister would not be continually telling us that the standards that will apply will not be the 2009 standards.  Is there something wrong with the 2009 standards?  Are they too onerous?  Is it not possible technologically to ensure septic tanks meet the 2009 standards?  Surely, the higher the standard, the cleaner the water, and the cleaner the water the better for all of us.  That is not the impression I am getting.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Any time anyone suggests that septic tanks will have to meet 2009 standards, they are told that will not be the case, as if somehow that is good news.  If it is good news, why then are the 2009 standards in place?  If not, why does the Government not change them?  If septic tanks are to be required to meet standards, then the Government will have to give people the money to do the work, whatever it takes, including where the landholding is too small for a percolation system and another form of technology has to be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">As usual, it is a case of let us try to cod Europe.  We will run it down and around the next corner, tell everyone the reason it is great and then run it down again.  We either want clean water or we do not.  We are either going to be straight up with the rest of the world or we are not.  If we are going to be straight up with it, we go for the best possible standards.  I hope this Government wants to have in place the best possible standards.  The Minister, in continually telling us that the 2009 standards will not apply, is saying this is not about water quality.  The Government is codding people to get this legislation through.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomFleming" eId="spk_221">
          <from>Deputy Tom Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_267">My concern in this regard is the involvement of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  We are all aware from our involvement at local council level of the stringent conditions imposed by the EPA which have prohibited many people from acquiring planning permission.  Many of the treatment plants installed during recent years cost, in terms of installation, testing and so on, in the region of  €15,000 to €20,000.  There is a grey area with regard to the criteria the inspectors will use and the subsequent policing measures.  For instance, when percolation testing was initially introduced more than 20 years ago, it was under the regulations of the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  Eolas, a subsidiary of the then Department of Education, was also involved.  The regulations were basic but they were effective and were commonly known as Standard Recommendation 6, or SR6.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Some six or seven years ago, Kerry County Council was the first of many local authorities to implement the new EPA guidelines.  A number of other councils did not adopt these guidelines until to two or three years ago.  Under these guidelines, people from rural areas in Kerry were refused planning permission and were forced to move to small towns and villages.  I foresee huge problems for people if the proposed inspections are to be undertaken by the EPA, given its stringent conditions.  I respect what the Minister had to say in this regard on Committee Stage.  It is to be hoped that he will build that into this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The Minister has been involved in politics for a long time and is a fair man.  He came up through the local authority system and understands people's fears in relation to the inspections.  I ask that he take these into account and ensure a tangible and solid provision in respect of inspections is included in the Bill.  Also, the standards for inspections should be set by this House.  I ask that, even at this late stage, the Minister outline the standards that will apply.  Should there be any grey areas in this regard, the public will suffer the consequences.  The EPA guidelines are not to be taken lightly.  Also, all councils that have implemented them will be required to adhere to them.  I ask the Minister to ensure the standards are acceptable and workable.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">Most septic tanks are functioning properly.  Many of them do not have treatment plants.  Regular de-sludging may, however, be necessary, in respect of which the Minister might consider providing grant aid.  The Minister has indicated that if the financial affairs of the country permit it, he would consider the introduction of grant aid in respect of those septic tanks requiring upgrade.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">I believe the Ombudsman's office is a more acceptable option than the courts in respect of appeals.  Also, people are concerned about the possibility of huge fines being imposed on them.  I ask that the Minister reconsider putting people through the ordeal of having to go to court.  I refer to innocent people who have avoided being in that situation down through the years and generations and who take great pride in that fact.  Members certainly should ensure this will not befall anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Another matter pertains to group sewerage schemes.  Perhaps the Minister will put in place funding in this regard as many areas now have clustered housing and I am sure there would be community involvement, whereby people would get together were appropriate grant aid available.  This would solve many of the difficulties.  I also ask the Minister to ensure there will not be a big rush of inspections into people's yards without giving proper notice to them.  Great concern exists and people have cause for fear, which may be helped by a better sense of awareness.  Hopefully this will be the case after today as Members clear up many of the clouds that hang over this measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_279">Ultimately however, I assure Deputy Healy-Rae that the €50 charge is provided for in primary legislation and ask him to consider when that has been done previously.  Consequently, any change will require an amendment to the Act and cannot be done on the whim of a Minister.  In the future, a majority in the House may wish to bring forward a proposal to make a change, although no such proposal will be brought to the House during my term as Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">I do not wish to prolong the debate on the section because the issues at stake are quite clear.  I wish to move on to other important aspects of the Bill.  As the Minister is aware, I set out my stall in detail at the outset as to the issues about which I have concerns.  The Minister should explain the purpose of the charge to Members.  He has stated its purpose is to pay for the cost of administering the legislation.  However, if this is a once-off charge of €50, particularly when one takes into account that only a small proportion of houses built annually are one-off housing with private waste water systems, it is clear that no continuous income stream has been provided.  Even the first flush of money, relative to the cost of implementing all this, will be very small.  Therefore, the Minister should elucidate further on the purpose of the charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">If 5,000 one-off houses were built throughout the country in the next six years, this would mean that approximately €10,000 would flow into the coffers of individual county councils.  What is the purpose of the fee?  If the fee is designed to provide the money necessary to run the system, then it will clearly not be adequate.  Whereas I accept everything the Minister says to the effect that it can only be changed by means of primary legislation, most Departments are aware that it is easier to change a figure than it is to include a new section in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I cannot understand why those who have provided for themselves and borne all the relevant costs to date are the only citizens who will be obliged to pay the fee.  Those who have everything done for them by the State are not being asked to pay it.  That is execrable.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the position and do the right thing in order that we might resolve this issue.  When the previous Government was in power, the Minister, a member of the Green Party, probably drafted proposals but no decision was taken on such proposals by that Administration.</p>

Deputy Ó Cuív stated that those who helped themselves - namely, the 440,000 rural householders - are the only citizens who will be obliged to pay the registration charge.  These people will also be obliged to pay the planned water tax because many of the group schemes are now connected to local authority water schemes.  They must also pay bin charges.  People in rural areas are obliged to pay higher bin charges than those who live in urban areas.  There is also the issue of the household tax to consider.  In addition, the cost of home heating oil, motor tax and school transport has increased.  Those to whom I refer will have to pay a range of costs.</p>

I have no difficulty taking the word of Deputy Ó Cuív, who was a Minister in the previous Government, in respect of this matter.  The Deputy is a man of impeccable standards.  It is possible that the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Mr. John Gormley, and his gurus were drafting proposals but I did not see them.  I would have strongly opposed anything which came from Mr. Gormley.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The €50 charge is extremely important and it will be enshrined in legislation when the Bill is passed.  The Minister might state that a Government would require a majority to change the fee.  However, as Deputy Ó Cuív stated, it would be much easier to change the figure from €50 to €500 than it would be to draft a new section for insertion into the legislation.  As far as I am concerned, the Minister is again engaging in sleight of hand in respect of this matter.  The Minister has been involved in politics for much longer than I have been and he knows the score, as do the advisers sitting beside him.</p>

That is all he is doing and he has let himself down badly since this debate commenced yesterday.  The Minister's performance falls very short of the mark.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">More importantly, we are talking about environmental standards.  The word "hypocrisy" was introduced to the debate.  If the Minister really cares about water quality, what is his problem with the 2009 standards to which we do not have to adhere, as he keeps telling us?  If we do not have to adhere to them, why are they in place?  He can change them if he thinks they are too onerous.  I ask him to, please, come clean now.  What is his opinion on the standards?  Are they too onerous?  Is it too much hassle to keep water clean and is it all about codding the European Union again?</p>

The Government of which he was a member - I supported him on this - spent €500 million from 2006 in dealing with water and wastewater matters in rural Ireland.  We have also spent €2,000 per house in group sewerage schemes which need to be examined again.  We also spend €2,000 where a household has a difficulty with its water pump or replacing its well.

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_578">I am outlining the basis for my proposal on the registration, if Deputy Lawlor wants to listen.  I want the certificate of registration to be valid for 40 years or for the lifetime of the household.  What is the reason for the Minister's clandestine measure that the person must re-register every five years?  We had the discussion about re-registering with the water services provider whoever that might be.  A future Government will not have to include that in a Bill because it is already in the primary legislation but it may have to change the €50 to €500.  I do not want to repeat the point made by Deputy Healy-Rae about school children but everybody knows that a charge of €50 per registration will not pay for much in the way of a special regime to deal with this serious issue.  The certificate of registration should be valid for the lifetime of the property and for not less than 40 years.  The Minister might respond by saying that a householder could sell a house and move on but that is addressed in a financial facility in that one must get an engineer to issue a BER certificate.  Will we have to get some other type of certificate for this issue, perhaps a SEWER certificate, when selling the house?  It is the thin end of the wedge.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">This is clever legislation drafted in a clandestine fashion to ensure the public, especially rural dwellers, can be tricked out of money.  The principle that this is about clean water has been abandoned because if that were the case why would we have amendments about noise and other pollution?  Those issues have nothing to do with clean water.  Why is the Minister afraid of the 2009 standards which we all want and to which every new building must adhere?  Why is he bringing in legislation that he said he will overrule and will not require planning permission?  If the 2009 legislation is enforced it will be because of me, Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív, Deputy Niall Collins, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and the Sinn Féin Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">This is patent nonsense, and the Minister knows that.  He has met representation from many people in his own constituency, which he is expected to do, and he is aware that the latest guidelines must be adhered to.  If not there will be third party objections or, worse, the involvement of An Taisce or some of the environmental bodies.  That is their brief.  There are representatives of An Taisce throughout the country.  I know some of them.  I sit on a board and regulate with one of them who is a very good and active member.  We might differ on some issues but his brief is to make submissions and, as a member of an NGO, travel to Brussels and complain if the standards are not maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">It is time this issue was dealt with honestly and openly.  The Minister should stop the "codology" of being the big hard man who pushes legislation through the House, talks all of us down and says he is will set the standards.  The nod and a wink job is no more.  That kind of politics is gone.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">We know the realpolitik is that these agencies and quangos have the power, some rightly and others wrongly, and they will use it.  I discussed that with a Member before he left the Chamber.  The NGOs and An Taisce already are drafting their complaints to Brussels.  They see the "codology" being peddled here by a senior Minister in the Government which will result in there not being any standards.  If the process is working, it is fine but there is no definition of "working".  It is a subjective term, and the Minister knows better than I do.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley</from>
          <p eId="para_584">I support the amendment.  Once a septic is registered it is on file in hard copy and on the computer system.  If a house has a septic tank there should not be a need to re-register in five years.  The suspicion is that it leaves the way open for additional charges to be imposed in the future.  While I recognise that it has been removed from the Bill for now, and I welcome the fact that currently there is no registration fee, the fact that the person must re-register every five years creates a sense of fear.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">The Minister will find out in the same way as the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, is finding out because, as he said, he is out of practice.  There is a long-term design here and, therefore, I ask the Minister to consider the issue and say that if one has registered, unless the house changes hands, there would not be a requirement for re-registering.  I join Deputy Stanley in asking under what regulation, law or statutory instrument the Minister will ensure that no matter how small the site, people will not be required to buy land in respect of a septic tank and percolation area in another person's land.  The Minister has said that and I take his word, but there must be some legal mechanism by which this can be done.  Will he state the relevant Act or statutory instrument under which this can be done?  Will an upgraded septic tank be required to have an environmental screening or an environmental impact analysis and will he tell the House the legal reference that gives him the power to do this, even in a special area of conservation, SAC?</p>

          <p eId="para_624">The Minister can say we are scaremongering, but we are not.  At a meeting in my county on Thursday of last week, a gentleman came from Galbally, County Limerick.  He was not a farmer but lived in a cottage.  Early in 2011, before any of this Bill was discussed, he had a visit from a county council official informing him that there had been a complaint that his septic tank system, which he had installed 27 years ago with planning permission, was too near a stream.  He had adhered to the planning conditions approved by the county council.  He was told he would have to move the tank and the percolation system in February 2011.  He is in the middle of this work at present.  The gentleman asked how he would pay for the assessment - Deputy Niall Collins might take up this issue - and the hire of specialists.  In fairness to the technician from the county council, he said he would do it for him.  He saved the gentleman a large sum of money.  He worked three days in a row.  He had to fill the hole pre-test, and got out of bed at 6 a.m. to fill the hole with a barrel of water.  He conducted three 12 hour tests.  This is happening in the real world.  The Minister knows this as well as I do, and so does Deputy Paudie Coffey.  The results were assessed in the office and the technician returned and told him what had to be done and the number of linear metres of percolation he had to install.  There is no point in saying any standards will do.  He had to do the work and pay planning fees.  That was last year when he had to comply with 2009 EPA standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I know An Taisce supports the legislation but it is not supporting the nonsense the Minister portrays that there will be no standards.  I will have a good chat with my friends on the telephone.  I do not like talking to An Taisce about things but it is patent nonsense to say there will be no standards.  This happened in Galbally, County Limerick, and it probably happened in many other places.  I appreciate the Chair's indulgence.</p>

What about a tank installed in 1965 and fixed to meet the standards that applied in 1965 or in 1955, before there was planning permission.  Is that okay?  That is a crucial issue.  The Minister has referred several times in recent days to the 2009 standards only applying to new houses.  I accept his word on that and I hope he is right.  However, I am asking about the case of someone who built a house in 1955 before planning permission was required and who put in a basic septic tank which is deemed to be causing pollution.  If an inspection is carried out and they are required to carry out works, will the 1955 standards apply?</p>

We will also be pressing at the committee that the EPA, An Taisce and such organisations should be invited in to advise the committee in advance in order that we inform ourselves of what will take place.  We can plod through these matters in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Deputy Stanley shares my concern on this issue.  It would be most helpful to us if the Minister could give the references, in law or statutory instrument, in other words, in primary or secondary legislation, that exempt us in respect of site size and arrangements whereby people do not have a septic tank on their own land but rather on a neighbour's land, and in respect of environmental screening and possible environmental impact analysis.  If the Minister does not have it to hand today, is it possible between now and the weekend to get for all Members the references to the particular legislative provisions that allow these exclusions?  The Minister has given categorical assurances in this regard.  We maintain that there must be some law to allow the Minister to do this.  Will the Minister get us these references so that we can study them, analyse them and establish whether they stand up?  If they are watertight, we will accept them.  I believe this is a reasonable request and it would allow me to sign off on two more underlying issues I had with this Bill at the beginning.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">That is a good question.  If we had proper clarity on these questions each time, we would be right.  It is not that I was not listening but I did not hear the answer the Minister gave to Deputy Stanley.  He referred to going back to 1965 and before that.  I am discussing the man in Limerick whose name I have before me.  Deputy Collins will check it out for me anyway.  This man received a visit last year, in February 2011, from a council official.  He was informed there was an issue with the tank, for which he received planning permission 20 years previously.  It was not granted anywhere near 1965, 1975 or 1985.  It would have been during the 1990s.  He built it to standard and installed it.  He is a bachelor and on his own so there would not be any great pressure of usage on it.  Apparently, someone objected to it because it was too near a stream.  If it was too near the stream, I do not believe it caused the problem and neither does he.  The tank was assessed and examined.  There was no leakage, seepage or outfall but he was still obliged to move it.  He was informed that as part of the tests he had to undergo, the tank had to come up to the 2009 levels.  This is the kernel of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Like Deputy Ó Cuív, I am keen for the Minister to put it on the record of the House.  He has made many commitments on the record of the House and in committee and I accept that.  I wish to know the reference numbers in primary law and secondary law, that is, the relevant statutory instruments.  What legislative provisions are in place to back up his claims?</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Sometimes the Minister is positive but sometimes he is glib too.  Deputy Coffey and I know, as do all the other Deputies, that the 2009 guidelines are being enforced daily.

I realise there is no open cheque but hardship cases will be billed by the Minister.  There will be a great deal of money because there will be a great deal of hardship.  Can the Minister state with any great degree of certainty that household septic tanks are causing any degree of pollution?  The Minister knows this and it is the kernel of the situation.  The county council and local authority systems are still polluting us, even though they have spent millions.  This is a total red herring.  Does the Minister believe the country people will accept this legislation or be bullied into submission once more by a Government that came to this House claiming openness and transparency and that it would sort out everything, but instead is attacking the ordinary people?  The Minister knows this and that is the genesis of the legislation.  I will put this to a vote.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs  (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
          <p eId="para_880">I welcome the opportunity provided by today's debate to discuss and reflect upon the important issue of inter-country adoption.  I am conscious that this is a topic of much interest to Deputies and to existing and prospective adoptive parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The issue of inter-country adoption has been the focus of particular attention in recent weeks arising from the circumstances and developments in Mexico, and it is appropriate that we allow time to discuss and understand the systems and standards governing this area.  I will begin by setting out the legislative policy and structural framework currently in place and address the issues relating to various countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">I note the number of developments in the area of adoption.  For example, the Adoption Authority of Ireland has approved 13 accredited bodies to perform the various adoption functions.  Equally, the Adoption Authority of Ireland has approved three accredited bodies to perform assessments, which should speed up considerably the process for couples, which as we all know has been far too long.  It should be noted that we have adoption arrangements with Bulgaria, China, Thailand and the Philippines.  Very recently representatives of the adoption authority agreed to travel to India to discuss an administrative arrangement between the two central authorities.  I will address the issues relating to a number of countries during the course of my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The practice of domestic and intercountry adoption in Ireland is governed by the Adoption Act 2010, which commenced on 1 November 2010.  Many Deputies in this House and the Seanad contributed to that legislation.  That commencement coincided with Ireland's ratification of the Hague Convention on the protection of children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption.  Signing that convention has changed this issue in Ireland and couples will primarily travel to countries which are signatories of the convention to effect intercountry adoptions.  There are some exceptions where there are other bilateral agreements in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The Adoption Authority of Ireland was established on 1 November, and the Act includes provisions for adoptions into Ireland from those countries which are signatories to the Hague Convention, or with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement.  There was also a transitional provision, which has been mentioned in the media in recent days.  That enabled prospective adopters to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague Convention or non-bilateral agreement country, if prior to 1 November 2010 they had been issued with a declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt.  The provision requires that the adoption authority is satisfied that the adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">We have the Adoption Act, which is a framework for standards, to ensure that all adoptions are in the best interests of the child.  The core of the adoption process is that it be carried out to the highest possible standards and in the best interests of the child.  It should not be forgotten that intercountry adoption is a service for those children who cannot be raised by their birth parents or cared for in their own country.  The interests of the child must be always paramount throughout the adoption process, and everybody in the House would agree that this is best achieved by the full implementation of the highest national and international standards governing the adoption process.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">In this context, Deputies who have raised adoption issues in the past will be familiar with the terms of the Hague Convention, which is a set of core standards designed to ensure good practice.  More than 80 countries have signed it, which means they have signed up to the highest international standards for intercountry adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The first point of the Hague Convention regards subsidiarity.  We have heard much about subsidiarity as it relates to Europe.  I was recently in Vietnam and that country is now committed to domestic adoption first.  This means that before a child is placed for intercountry adoption, every effort must have been exhausted in the native country to see if people wish to adopt the child in that country.  The rate of domestic adoptions is going up in Vietnam, meaning there will be fewer children who will be suitable or available for intercountry adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The second principle regards support for birth families and the need for free and informed consent.  There are examples where consent has either not been sought or given freely, and nobody would support that.  The third key principle provides that no party should profit from the intercountry adoption process and no money should change hands beyond legitimate expenses incurred.  It is important that prospective adoptive parents are fully aware of these key guiding principles before beginning the adoption process.  All adoptive parents have told me they would want such provisions for their children and these standards implemented.  They are in the interests of the adopted children as much as those of the parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I will mention some statistics for intercountry adoption.  The adoption board registered 341 foreign adoptions in 2003, rising to a high of 397 in 2008.  The number of registrations has declined somewhat since, with approximately 200 intercountry adoptions in 2010 and 2011.  There has been a transition period arising from the Hague Convention, which has made it difficult for couples.  There is a new way and a more stringent set of standards, with the process more complex in many ways than it was in the past.  More than 700 children from Vietnam have found homes here, along with 1,500 children from Russia and others from Ethiopia and other countries.  We have a very good experience of intercountry adoption, and many families have provided warm and stable homes to children through that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Intercountry adoption is not without risk, and it is for this reason that the principles set out in the Hague Convention were developed.  We want to minimise those risks at every stage of the adoption process.  If countries have not signed up to the Hague Convention, there must be a bilateral arrangement or a very strong administrative agreement.  The first priority is the welfare of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The application of the Hague principles falls to the designated central authorities in the respective referring and receiving countries.  In the case of Ireland, the function is discharged by the Adoption Authority of Ireland, which was established in late 2010.  I stress that this authority is an independent, quasi-judicial body appointed by the Government.  I pay tribute to the chair, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, and the very dedicated staff in that organisation who have had to cope with a changed process, the concerns of adoptive parents, the intricacies of the legal positions between countries and coming to terms with different legal processes in the countries they deal with.  It is very complex work and as everybody in the House knows, it is a very emotionally demanding time for adoptive parents as they try to get a handle on the different processes and legal issues.  For many, that comes after a very long assessment process.  The assessment period should now be down to one year, and there is no need for it to be any longer in the vast majority of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">I will mention a number of countries as I know Deputies have particular concerns.  I have outlined to the House already the position with regard to Vietnam.  The Hague Convention will enter into force there on 1 February 2012, and this is a significant milestone for the country.  The Vietnamese authorities have put in a considerable effort to strengthen and regulate the adoption practice, and Deputies will remember that adoptions were suspended from that country several years ago.  I felt it appropriate to begin to re-establish political and diplomatic links with the Vietnamese when I came into office, which I have done, and I recently visited the country.  I am happy to say that was a positive visit, and I know the developments there are of particular interest to the 19 couples who were about to adopt when the process was halted, as well as the 200 who had named Vietnam as a country from which they would like to adopt children.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">We will shortly be in a position to have the accredited agencies named that will work in Vietnam with couples, and we will be able to have an administrative arrangement with Vietnam that will lead to a resumption of adoptions between Ireland and Vietnam.  I have invited the head of Vietnam's adoption authority and its Minister for justice to visit Ireland, and both have accepted the invitation.  I look forward to having them here and discussing further the inter-country adoption process between Ireland and Vietnam.  Adoptions from Mexico have been the subject of particular media focus in recent weeks.  The chairman of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Mr. Shannon, has set out very clearly the position of the authority with regard to the regulation of adoptions between Mexico and Ireland.  The authority has been proactive and has gone to Mexico to work with the Mexican Central Authority.  There is a very good relationship between the central authority in Mexico and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Adoptions can continue between this country and Mexico.  Any adoption from Mexico must be effected between the respective central authorities.  There is no provision under these arrangements for processing private adoptions.  I understand that the 11 cases in question arose from private arrangements.  I reiterate the advice to prospective adoptive parents that applicants considering Mexico should first consult the Adoption Authority of Ireland website for the latest advisory notice.  Approximately seven advisory notices on Mexico have already been published on the website.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">I am very much aware that the recent events will also have given rise to concerns for those who have previously adopted from Mexico.  I reassure those adoptive parents that the authority has no evidence that previous adoptions are unsafe or are affected by the recent events in Mexico.  The recent unfortunate developments serve to reinforce the need to ensure that all intercountry adoptions are properly regulated and effected in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I refer briefly to Ethiopia.  It is not a signatory to the Hague Convention.  I gave approval to the Adoption Authority to commence a process of examining the feasibility of a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia.  The authority has confirmed that it has commenced this process and it will keep me informed of progress in this regard.  I emphasise that we are at a very early stage in this process.  Given that Ethiopia has not signed the Hague Convention we will have to visit the country, look at the legal systems and see the compatibility under the new arrangements under the Hague Convention.  Because so many children here have been adopted from Ethiopia, many couples, if they intend to adopt a second child, understandably, would like to adopt from the same country.  Many couples have been caught in the situation where the country from which they previously adopted has not signed the Hague Convention and therefore there is not the automatic exchange there could have been if they had signed.  Because of the representations that have been made to me and the fact that so many children have come from Ethiopia to live here I have asked the Adoption Authority to assess the situation and to come to a decision on it as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">What I have been keen to do in the area of intercountry adoption is not to have a situation where there is drift.  I want clarity about what countries couples can adopt from.  I want them to know what the situation is, and where countries are not compliant with the Hague Convention I wish to be clear whether we have the resources and the possibility of working with those countries.  As one can imagine, quite an amount of resources are required if one is to work with other countries that are not compliant with the Hague Convention.  The work on adoption must be seen in the context of many other demands on my Department and in the area of child protection.  There has been a visit to Russia as well.  Complex constitutional issues arise but they are being examined to see whether a resolution is possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">I am very conscious of the challenges and stresses faced by prospective Irish adoptive parents as they seek to adopt a child from outside Ireland.  There are several contributory factors in this, including the very challenging and rigorous assessment process and the level of uncertainty which has been a feature of intercountry adoption.  In particular, we have seen a decrease in the number of children available for intercountry adoption in recent years following the ratification of the Hague Convention by a number of countries.  While I sympathise fully with those going through the adoption process I stress that the best interests of the children in this process must be at the core of all of our thinking and actions.  I know that this is a shared objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I will be very much guided by the advice I receive from the Adoption Authority of Ireland which has such a key role to play in this area.  We have an obligation, of which I am very conscious, to ensure that the interests of the children involved, their birth parents, and prospective adoptive parents are fully respected throughout the process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcConalogue" eId="spk_475">
          <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
          <p eId="para_899">I thank the House and the Minister for ensuring that time was allocated to debate the issue on the floor of the Dáil today because it is an important issue to many families across the country, and in particular to prospective adoptive parents.  It is also something which is of great value to the many children who find themselves in adoptive families with the chance that offers them to have a new life, in many cases a much better chance in life than would have been the case had they not been adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">It is opportune that time has been allocated for today's debate given the confusion among many prospective parents who have engaged with the adoption process and have made the decision that they want to go down that road.  It has been a difficult couple of years for many of them during the bedding-in period following the introduction of the Hague Convention.  Many couples were in the process of adoption prior to the implementation of the Adoption Act 2010 when this country signed up to the Hague Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">I note the work done by the previous Minister, Mr. Barry Andrews, to introduce the Act and put in place a framework in which adoption here could be regarded as safe and secure for families adopting and provide a platform of assurance that the intercountry adoptions process is in the best interests of those children who come here.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">Today's debate follows on from the Minister's visit to Vietnam with the chairman of the Adoption Authority and staff from both offices.  I commend the Minister for taking the step to travel to Vietnam with the Adoption Authority to engage with the Vietnamese Government and Minister for justice to assess where they are at in terms of its decision to sign up to the Hague Convention from the start of February 2012, and to tease out the issues on a face-to-face basis which must be resolved for adoptions to be able to proceed and commence once again between Ireland and Vietnam.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">In recent years a significant number of children were adopted from Vietnam.  The Minister referred to a total of 700 Vietnamese children living here now, and having met many of them, happily so.  When the previous intercountry agreement with Vietnam lapsed in mid-2009 many families were in the process of adopting children.  Up to 200 families had engaged with the authorities in Vietnam at that stage to seek to adopt children.  A total of 19 families were at an advanced stage of the adoption process.  It was highly distressing and stressful for those in that situation.  It is a long process from making a decision to adopt, getting approval and reaching the stage of finalising an adoption.  Families and prospective parents must indicate during the application which country they seek to adopt from.  In many ways they are then tied in to that choice.  In the case in particular of those who had chosen Vietnam and engaged with the process there, when it stalled it left many in a distressed situation.  No doubt, like me, many Deputies have spoken to prospective parents involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">The chairman of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, gave a radio interview on Radio 1 alongside the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, upon her return from Vietnam.  As was appropriate, he stated that adoption was not a service for parents, but for children and that the rights of children must be paramount at all stages.  It is good that so many prospective parents are keen to adopt children and make them a part of their lives, but there is an onus on us all - parents are supportive in this regard - to ensure the processes in place in the countries with which we are undertaking adoptions are as secure as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">Consider the recent situation in Mexico in which some prospective parents have unwittingly found themselves.  Even though Mexico is a signatory to the Hague Convention, this type of situation has developed.  It is crucial that adoptions be undertaken through foreign countries' approved agencies and with the full approval of the Adoption Authority.  The children seeking to be adopted are at a vulnerable stage in their lives and are normally not in a position to make the necessary decisions.  It is essential that our Administration and the administration of the countries with which we are engaging take on the responsibility of ensuring children's rights are at the core of adoption services and appropriate structures are put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">In the Minister's closing remarks, perhaps she could elaborate on the precise details that remain to be ironed out with the Vietnamese authorities.  In terms of financial transactions, was ensuring the Hague conditions discussed?  No cloud can hang over the issue, given the doubts raised by previous reports.  That situation led to the intercountry agreement between Ireland and Vietnam not being signed in mid-2009 pending the Vietnam's adoption of the convention.  What is the likely timeline?  Vietnam will sign up on 1 February, but I do not under-estimate the amount of work that remains to be done.  I noted the caution in Mr. Shannon's comments, in that while every effort would be made, much work remains to be done.  We want to be clear so that Irish people seeking to adopt know what the outcome is likely to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">A significant number of adoptions were processed in Florida, yet prospective parents are still quite unclear about adoptions from Florida and Russia.  After indicating their willingness to adopt through both, they have found themselves in limbo.  I understand the Adoption Authority and the Department's difficulties with providing specific timeframes, given the lack of certainty about how to sort out the remaining issues, but it is important that we communicate as much information as possible to prospective parents.  It is a highly distressing situation after having invested so much commitment and time.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">That so many countries have ratified the Hague Convention is important.  Some 57 countries have signed up to it.  According to the Minister's remarks on the number of future adoptions that are likely to emanate from Vietnam, their profile will be different and the Vietnamese authorities will be required to ensure children have an opportunity to be adopted within their own country.  Although it will lead to fewer children getting the chance to live in our country, the Hague Convention will ensure the child's interests are paramount.  That children will have an opportunity to be adopted within their own country is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">I urge the Minister to continue her work with the Adoption Authority on finalising outstanding arrangements with other Hague Convention countries in order that adoptions from them can occur.  She should also progress our bilateral agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I will address domestic adoptions and emphasise the importance of changing our arrangements, particularly in the context of the children's referendum, a constitutional change that would afford all children the opportunity to be adopted regardless of their parents' marital status.  For decades, there has been a significant decrease in the number of children being adopted domestically.  In many ways, this is a good sign, as children are going to homes that welcome them.  However, there will always be a number of children for whom adoption offers the best future.  Unfortunately, the current structure of the Constitution means that many children must spend much of their lives in foster care and cannot be adopted by their foster families.  That this anomaly has not been addressed to date is unfortunate.  Legislation was to have addressed it, but High Court rulings narrowed the legislation's provisions down so significantly that it became ineffectual.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I urge the Minister to fast-track the referendum as quickly as is appropriate.  I also urge her to consult the political parties and the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  In a recent interview, she mentioned that the wording was nearly finalised.  I am concerned that, although the wording has nearly been finalised and the Minister is discussing holding the referendum in just a few months, she has not consulted other parties or the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">The Minister should consider putting two questions in the referendum, one on adoption and the other on children's rights.  This idea deserves a great deal of consideration.  The referendum should be held on its own so that it can be given the appropriate attention.  Consultation, working together and information will play key roles, particularly given the lessons of last year's referendums. I urge the Minister to engage promptly with the other parties and the committee on the referendum's wording.  She should also set a date for the referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">I commend the Minister for her work, which is important for many prospective parents.  I urge her to keep pressing the issue and thank her for raising the matter on today's agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_476">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_914">The laws surrounding adoption, both domestic and intercountry, were for many years a tangled web.  The Adoption Act 2009 rectified some of the issues at the heart of what was, legislatively speaking, a complex mess.  Section 19 of that Act stated that in any matter, application or proceedings before the Adoption Authority or in any court, the welfare of the child must be regarded as the first and paramount consideration.  This has the effect of placing the child at the centre of the adoption process, with the objective being to place him or her with a suitable family rather than providing a family with a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">This sentiment was echoed in the agreed wording of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  We proposed that the child's best interests be the foremost consideration in all matters concerning their custody, guardianship and welfare, which would necessarily include adoption.  Sinn Féin would like to have seen this proposed provision go further to ensure the best interests of children were the primary concern in all matters concerning them.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">Section 9 of the Act gave effect to the State's participation in the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoptions.  Some commentators argue that the convention is in need of reform.  At its heart is the stipulation that all adoptions, regardless of their type, are recognised by the operation of the law in all states that are party to the convention.  There are distinctions between differing types of adoption - whether they are "full" or "simple" and so on - that give rise to very technical legal distinctions regarding the rights of adoptive parents and biological parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Section 145 of the Act sets out the rules regulating the payments and donations permitted as part of the adoption process.  Accredited bodies may accept what are described as "reasonable" costs and expenses related to their functions and reasonable fees for their professional services, while gifts of money may only be accepted with the express approval of the Adoption Authority.  This provision is at the heart of many intercountry adoption processes.  The Special Commission on the Hague Convention has on numerous occasions remarked that there must be transparency in regard to costs and payments made.  This is especially important when we are dealing with countries in which the average wage is far below that in Ireland.  Given that there is much room for exploitation, it is absolutely essential that all parties adhere to the letter of the Hague convention, including Article 4 which states that a child may only be adopted if he or she is adoptable.  In other words, the adoption must be in the child's best interests and the necessary consents must have been obtained from the biological parent or parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">We are all aware of the concerns regarding the adoption process in Vietnam.  The Government must pay close attention to future agreements with other countries to prevent a situation similar to that which arose when our agreement with Vietnam collapsed, affecting 200 Irish couples who were in the process of adopting children there.  I am sure the Minister and other Members were, like me, lobbied by couples in our respective constituencies who were greatly affected by that situation.  Many hopes were dashed and great hurt and pain ensued.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">While those still seeking to adopt will face significant delays under the revised agreement, these delays, though inconvenient, must be accepted given that the processes involved are in the best interests of the children concerned.  I acknowledge and respect those who wish to give children a loving home in Ireland.  That is highly commendable.  However, we must also be sensitive to the factors that lead parents in less well-off countries to place their children for adoption.  Moreover, we must also acknowledge that it may well be the case that adoption would not be in the best interests of particular children or the best option for their future.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">One is reminded of the situation here where parents who find themselves without the financial means to raise their children may voluntarily place them in the care system in the hope of giving them what they view as a "better life."  In such cases the State will provide a foster parent with a significant payment towards the cost of raising the child or children.  Surely it would be better for the State to acknowledge that this may not be in the best interests of the child and that it would be better to introduce a social welfare structure which supports families and does not force them into such a situation.  Perhaps we should ask ourselves whether international aid has a role to play here.  I suspect that many parents in developing countries who place their children for adoption would not do so had they the financial means to raise their families themselves.  I do not share the view that a Western home is automatically and inherently better for the child in an intercountry adoption.  I suspect that is far from universally the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">This brings me to the shady motivation - there is no other way to describe them - behind some adoption organisations overseas.  Time and again we have seen how, in the wake of natural disasters or in conflict zones - Haiti comes to mind  in this regard - baby businesses masquerading as adoption organisations will swoop in and say, "Let us take these children to be adopted and give them a better home."  Surely it would be better for the children to remain with their parents and for the international community to help in rebuilding their societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">These are highly emotive, sensitive and sometimes controversial issues.  Even the most basic understanding of globalisation and debt demonstrates that extreme poverty in some countries is what facilitates and allows the unbridled wealth of others to accumulate.  We as legislators have a responsibility to be cognisant of all of these factors when examining this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">This State ceased adopting from Vietnam in 2009 after choosing, as the United States had done the previous year, not to renew its bilateral agreement, following the discovery of cases of baby farming and baby trafficking.  I hope the Government will keep a close eye on these matters to ensure, first and foremost, that the rights of children are upheld and that we are sensitive to the experiences of those who are or were unwittingly duped into participating in the commodification of non-Western children.  For many years, poor children in Ireland were taken from their parents because others felt they "knew best" and that there was a better class of parent elsewhere.  There was a stratum of overseers in Irish society which held that view.  It is not a mind set that should be applied or transferred from our past experience to any other jurisdiction today.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">Further to this, I am mindful of the advice provided by the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, on the Adoption Act 2009.  I urge the Minister to take on board and implement her outstanding recommendations, especially that consideration be given to requiring that bilateral agreements with states not party to the Hague Convention be reviewed periodically.  I am disappointed the State did not see fit to see to address the adoption rights of same-sex couples in the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2011.  It is an outstanding issue that has been raised time and again.  I can only describe this as a deliberate omission, which is a source of much sadness and disappointment for many gay and lesbian couples.  People who wish to provide loving homes for children should not be barred from doing so because of their gender or sexuality.  In 2012, I would have expected the Government to have seen fit to address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">I again congratulate the Minister on her efforts in resolving the Vietnamese agreement.  I urge her to continue to ensure that children are front and centre in all these issues and I wish her every success in her continued efforts in this regard.  The interests of the child must be at the heart of all decisions made, not alone here but globally.</p>

          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_926">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on intercountry adoption.  I welcome also that the Minister is in the House for this debate.  This is an issue relevant to the many Irish families hurt and disappointed in Mexico in recent weeks.  We all support the safety and protection of children.  This debate should focus on the rights of the child to a safe and warm environment.  This also applies in respect of foster homes, adoptive families, State care, child care and families under the care of the HSE.  We need proper standards and regulation to ensure the maximum protection of the child and his or her needs.  There can be no rowing back in this regard.  I urge the Minister to work hard to deliver on making child safety the number one issue.  We can deal with all other issues down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">I have always supported adoptive parents.  I have experience in this area from a personal family situation and having worked with adoptive parents as a backbench Deputy.  I have witnessed amazing caring situations.  I am proud of our adoptive parents and families.  They have made a massive contribution to this country.  Let us not forget in this debate our foster families who do a great job for this country in terms of saving children from hardship, hurt and abuse.  I commend them on the excellent contribution to this State and to society.  I thank them for their efforts.  They are giving thousands of children a warm and happy place of comfort and doing the State a great service.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Many families believe the process of adoption in Ireland is too long given that it can be completed in other countries in 15 months.  This needs to be addressed.  We all support the Hague Convention but there is a need to speed up this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The issue of genital mutilation in African countries needs to be discussed in this debate.  This issue is relevant in the context of my earlier remarks on child safety and protection.  The international community needs to stand up and be counted and ensure these children are protected.  This is not a time for sitting on the fence.  It is a time for protecting the rights of all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Another issue relevant to this debate but not yet touched on is children born through surrogacy, an important issue for 30 children in Irish families.  There is no legislation in place in Ireland to govern surrogacy.  As such, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Passport Office are directing all parents to the courts.  As there is no legislation, the courts have no guidelines on this issue and cases are often bumped into the High Court, the costs for which are crippling.  Many families do not have the that type of money.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has stated he has no responsibility in this matter, that it is a matter for the courts.  This issue requires compassionate consideration.  I would like to know the statutory legal basis upon which the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is refusing to issue a passport to a child born through surrogacy, with expressed reference to statutory legal provisions relied upon.  Also, why is he insisting that parents of children born through surrogacy obtain a declaration of parentage when no such requirement is imposed in respect of applications for passports for children born outside Ireland to Irish citizens?  One particular child, Robyn, who is 16 months old, has no parents, guardians, citizenship or passport.  She and all other children born through surrogacy cannot be registered with a doctor or school.  I have been asked by many people to raise this issue.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue which is currently affecting 30 children in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">Adoptions from Ethiopia and Russia have been stopped owing to the Hague Convention on the Rights of the Child.  There are no plans for a bilateral agreement in the future.  What then is the position of those families who already have a child from these countries who want to extend their family with a sibling for their child?  The waiting period for the adoption certificate is too long.  While previously this process took six weeks, it now takes three to six months, owing, we are told, to staffing issues.  Can orphans around the world wait for us to get our staff issues sorted?  These children need us and many Irish families need them.  The longer they remain in care, the more institutionalised they become and the less likely they will be adopted.  This leaves them open to abuse such as genital mutilation, in particular in African countries, child trafficking, the sex trade and so on.  I ask again, do we not uphold the rights of the child?  Are we, in allowing them to remain where they are because we are bogged down with bureaucracy, abusing their rights?  We should stop this abuse and allow Irish families to adopt.  Many are disheartened by the process here.  In Britain, the process takes only 12 to 15 months.  It is important to raise such issues during this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, provided advice to the Government on the Adoption Bill 2009, in line with her statutory function under section 7 of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 to advise Ministers of the Government on the probable effects of proposals for legislation on children.  One of the issues raised in her advice on the Adoption Bill was the regulation of inter-country adoption and the ratification of the Hague Convention on intercountry adoptions.  I am delighted we have an Ombudsman for Children who is supportive on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">I referred to the recent crisis in Mexico.  The board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland met recently to discuss the issue of the 11 Irish couples who became unwittingly embroiled in a suspected illegal adoption ring.  The board, with five members, has ultimate approval in respect of all adoptions in Ireland, domestically and abroad.  I commend Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, chairman of the adoption authority, on its work.  Mr. Shannon has stated that the only adoptions recognised in Ireland are those approved by the state agencies in individual countries.  The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption came into force in Ireland in November 2010.  Mexico is also a signatory.  Mr. Shannon also stated: "We are uncompromising in ensuring that international standards are met ... because the Hague Convention since November 1st is the instrument that regulates inter-country adoption."  I support this.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">As regards the situation in Mexico, the past few weeks have been difficult for the Irish couples involved.  They have been questioned by the Mexican police but none was detained and most have since returned to Ireland.  One teenage mother who was interviewed told how her nine month old baby girl was taken by a woman who paid her $755 and said the child would be used for an anti-abortion photo shoot and returned within a fortnight.  The child was left in the care of an Irish couple in a resort town called Ajijic.  The couple were given the impression that they would be adopting the child.  One can only imagine the hurt and disappointment of the families involved.  That is the downside of adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">On the positive side, I commend the Minister for her work in this area in which she has shown leadership.  While Members on this side of the House are criticised regularly for not acknowledging when people in government do the right thing, as an independent Deputy I say it straight out as it is.  The Minister stated earlier that the Adoption Act also contains an exceptional transitional provision that enables prospective adoptive parents to "proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague Convention or non-bilateral agreement country, if prior to 1 November 2010 they had been issued with a declaration of eligibility and suitability to adopt".  The provision requires that the adoption authority is satisfied that the adoption meet the standards of the Hague Convention.  I welcome these comments and strongly support the Minister in this.  As the Minister emphasised, the key thing is the best interests of the child.  As several of my Opposition colleagues already have noted, international standards of best practice are required.  This is the way forward and is the sensible thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The Minister also touched on the numbers.  Fore example, in the years 2010 and 2011, the number of registrations of intercountry adoptions amounted to approximately 200 people.  Since the enactment of the new adoption legislation in 2010, the adoption authority has registered a total of 368 foreign adoptions.  I mention these families because I wish to thank them and commend them.  The Minister also touched on the risks, which is a matter about which all Members must be vigilant and careful.  As she stated, the first priority is the welfare of children involved and every step must be taken to ensure the highest standards are in operation.  This is something Members on all sides of the House will support strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">I will touch on an issue that has not been raised previously.  It is a minority issue, albeit an important one, namely, adoptive parents who adopt children with a disability.  That is an amazing thing to do and I have witnessed families who have done so.  Moreover, an amazing contribution is being made to Irish society and I consider this to be active patriotism of the highest order.  Adoption a child with a disability by young parents and young couples provides that child with an amazing opportunity.  In addition, this affords the State an amazing opportunity to recognise such people as individuals who are making a massive contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">The Minister also dealt with the Vietnam issue.  I am glad that rather than making telephone calls or sending e-mails, the Minister adopted a hands-on approach and travelled to Vietnam.  She met people in Hanoi and took the opportunity for personal engagement with the Vietnamese authorities.  Such actions and co-operation are necessary in such a situation.  While I do not have the details, I understand Mr. Geoffrey Shannon also visited Vietnam at around the same time or previously.  My point is that when dealing with such issues, Ministers must adopt a hands-on approach and consequently, I welcome the Minister's involvement on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">I have touched on the serious Mexican issue and I refer to the Ethiopian issue.  Ethiopia is not a signatory to the Hague Convention and the Minister has stated that future adoptions from Ethiopia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, would first require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia.  I urge the Minister to get on with that and to deal with it positively and constructively.  Moreover, the Adoption Authority of Ireland has a major role to play on this issue.  I welcome the Minister's affirmation that she always will be guided by the advice of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, particularly with regard to redefining and redesigning intercountry adoption in line with best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Members must ensure that such children are protected.  They must ensure they are put into warm, safe and secure environments and safe homes.  This is an important point in this debate.  I welcome this debate and I urge the Minister to consider the issues I have raised therein.  I wish her well in the future in respect of her responsibility to look after and look out for the protection and rights of children.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_942">I wish to share time with Deputy Fitzpatrick.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">I welcome this debate, as well as the statement by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, in which she has provided a detailed up-to-date position on her activities since her appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  In recent years, I have worked closely with couples in County Clare who have been tied up in the long drawn-out process of adoption.  Such people have real personal cases and my heart goes out to them as it sometimes seems as though this process will never end.  In recent years, couples trying to adopt a child from Vietnam in particular have been left in limbo with little progress made.  No interim arrangements were put in place before the Hague Convention became law and following the lapse of Ireland's bilateral agreement with Vietnam in May 2009.  Moreover, the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs made the situation even worse by not communicating with prospective adoptive parents.  Consequently, the news that adoptions between Vietnam and Ireland are set to resume in the coming months is most welcome.  This situation has come about due to the commitment of the new Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who from her first days as Minister, has set out a plan to sort out this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">A total of 200 Irish couples were in the process of adopting children from Vietnam when the bilateral adoption agreement lapsed into 2009.  A further 19 couples were at an advanced stage of adopting a child from Vietnam at that time.  One couple from that group lives in my native county of Clare and I welcome the degree of engagement the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has had with them.  She has met and spoken with the couple, has been sympathetic and has listened to what they have had to say.  A number of productive interactions have taken place between Ireland and Vietnam since the formation of the new Government.  On her return from a recent visit to Vietnam, the Minister indicated that significant progress over key issues now has been made.  She also indicated that there now is agreement on all the main issues, such as safeguards relating to consent, dealing with central authorities and issues pertaining to money.  In all of these discussions, the best interests of the child have been the overriding concern.  I welcome this approach and I welcome the work completed to date.  I understand that the Minister, having highlighted and stressed the case of the group of 19 advanced applicants, also received a commitment from the Vietnamese Minister for Justice that priority will be given to their applications.  This assurance is most welcome.  It is clear that our State's relationship with Vietnam has been greatly enhanced in recent months and the work led by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, must be built on.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I have a number of questions the Minister might address in her response to this debate.  The Minister should give her views as to when adoptions can commence formally between Ireland and Vietnam.  The chairman of the Adoption Authority of Ireland gave assurances last June that no impediments would exist after October 2011.  Consequently, those involved wish to know when these adoptions will formally commence.  In addition, when is it envisaged that an agency will be accredited to Vietnam?  I wish to establish the current position regarding the accreditation process for the Helping Hands organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">I compliment the Minister and her officials on their work in the field of adoption and look forward to hearing her response to the questions I have posed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_480">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_947">The Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, or Hague Adoption Convention, protects children and their families against the risks of illegal, irregular, premature or ill-prepared adoptions abroad.  This convention, which also operates through a scheme of national central authorities, reinforced the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and seeks to ensure that intercountry adoptions are made in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights and to prevent the abduction, sale of or traffic in children.  These are phenomenal aspirations which should be cherished.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The Adoption Act 2010 was commenced on 1 November 2010.  This coincided with Ireland's formal ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  The Adoption Authority was also established on 1 November 2010.  The purpose of the 2010 Act is to improve standards in the context of domestic and intercountry adoptions.  The regulatory framework governing adoption has been strengthened in an attempt to ensure that the best interests of children will be protected at every step throughout the adoption process.  Since 1 November 2010, it has been possible to effect intercountry adoptions with other countries that have ratified the Hague Convention or with which Ireland has bilateral agreements.  From 1 November 2010, anyone wishing to effect an adoption from a Hague Convention country must be satisfied that the adoption is in compliance with the rules set out in the convention.  The key rules to be adhered to are: that the adoption must comply with all the terms and conditions of the Hague Convention; that the agent or agency handling the adoption is properly accredited by the central authority of the sending State; and that the agent or agency can produce a valid Article 23 certificate from a competent authority of the sending State in respect of the adoption.  These rules have often been criticised as being excessive.  In light of recent revelations it is fair to state that they serve a great purpose and have much merit.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Article 2 of the Hague Convention states that it shall apply to all adoptions between two contracting states.  Applicants proposing to adopt a child from Hague Convention countries must be satisfied, therefore, that the adoption documents comply with the terms and conditions of the convention prior to the processing and finalisation of the adoption.  Applicants should make inquiries in the country of origin with the accredited agents and with the national central authority of that state.  In effect, this places the onus on the adoptors to satisfy themselves that the correct procedures are being adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">It is extremely unfortunate that recent high profile issues relating to foreign adoptions have brought this matter on to the front pages of our newspapers.  I use the word "unfortunate" because it reflects the lost opportunity for prospective adoptive parents to bestow joy and love upon children they might wish to adopt.  I have first-hand experience of the kind of joy and love a child can bring to a family.  I have met two families which have enjoyed fulfilling experiences when they adopted children, via the correct procedures, from Vietnam and Mexico.  When done within the parameters set down in the prescribed regulations, the adoption process may at times appear long.  It is a commendable, robust and upstanding process, placed at the centre of which has always been the best interests of children.  The recent events that gained public attention and led to front-page newspaper headlines only serve to reinforce the value of the Hague Convention and illustrate that the correct procedures are in place and have served so many Irish families and, in particular, children so well.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">As much as I applaud the robustness of the system in place, that system still does not mask the fact that there are babies for sale throughout the world.  The fact that this reprehensible practice is followed should further strengthen the resolve of potential adoptors to use the correct channels and never deviate from the protocol that has been established.  Conducted correctly, the adoption process is joyous, wonderful and fulfilling.  It should be the focus of people seeking to adopt and they should never, no matter how tempted they might be, seek to deviate from the official path.  Potential parents should only consider adopting from countries that have embraced the Hague Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">I remind the House and the people of the mission statement of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, which says "We will work to achieve excellence in adoption and adoption related services, with the best interests of children as our primary consideration".  Every person who engages with the adoption process should bear those words in mind.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DaraCalleary" eId="spk_481">
          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_953">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I acknowledge the work the Minister has done since her appointment, particularly in the context of bringing about a resolution in respect of the issue relating to Vietnam.  I was disappointed by the criticism I heard earlier of the role of the former Minister of State, Mr. Barry Andrews, in respect of that matter.  Having worked with him on it, I am aware that he did his level best to try to bring about the earliest possible resolution.  Those of us who were Members of the Dáil at that time and who were meeting parents, and so on, are aware of the major difficulties which obtained.  Mr. Barry Andrews had an enormous personal commitment in respect of trying to see this matter through.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Deputy Finian McGrath referred to the need for absolute clarity in respect of adoptions from Vietnam in order that those who were waiting to make such adoptions during the period to which I refer can proceed to adopt now and to give the children in question the love they deserve and complete their family units.  I know the Minister will ensure that this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">This debate provides us with the opportunity to consider the work of the Adoption Authority of Ireland and, in particular, its chairman, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon.  At a time when so many people are criticising civil and public servants, Mr. Shannon shines as a beacon.  I have no doubt he could probably become very wealthy were he to pursue a career in law in the private sector.  However, he has chosen to devote much of this time to the welfare and legal protection of children, be it through the work of the Adoption Authority of Ireland or in his role as special rapporteur.  The Minister and I spent some time together on the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children and we are aware of the work Mr. Shannon and many others in the sector have done to try to construct a framework which is robust and which respects the emotions of the people involved.  The difficulty with adoption and fostering is that emotions can, understandably, run high.  That issue lies at the heart of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">The problem in this matter is that the law is an emotionless entity.  Law and standards do exactly what it says on the tin.  They are in place for a reason and it is important that they are there.  When law and standards clash with emotions, various people - including Members of these Houses - get stuck in the middle.  Individuals such as Mr. Geoffrey Shannon are there to shine a light, lessen the impact of the clash to which I refer, ensure that the correct laws and protections are put in place and to bring the emotional issues to the debate.  Mr. Shannon does that very well.  The work of the Adoption Authority of Ireland since its establishment in 2010 is testament to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The Hague Convention is crucially important.  I read an article in recent days which stated that this issue first arose for Ireland in the context of the adoption of Romanian children some 20 years ago.  It has previously had a relatively minor impact in particular cases.  There are Members present who probably know individuals who were adopted as babies from Romania and who are now adults.  During the past 20 years, the number of countries from which children are being adopted by parents from Ireland and elsewhere has continued to grow.  This is a worldwide phenomenon and that is why the Hague Convention is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Nobody doubts the genuine need of parents who travel abroad to adopt children.  Equally, no one doubts the love these people are capable of giving.  As the events of recent days illustrate, however, there is reason to doubt some of those involved at the other end of the process.  The Hague Convention is an attempt to put in place a form of worldwide standard in order that when people invest time and emotion in the process, they will know that - regardless of their intentions - they will not be the innocent victims if anything goes wrong.  It must be remembered that in the middle of all this are the children.  It has taken a long time to establish the Hague Convention and to get matters right in respect of it.  Ireland must seek to try to keep pace with developments relating to this convention and to work to change it, where required.  In instances where the convention puts rules in place just for the sake of it, let us alter those rules.  Let us not have a system which is so immune to the emotions and love involved in the process that it will get in the way of that process and add to people's pain.  Ireland is in a unique position to adopt a robust approach in this regard.  The Minister has a great deal of experience - in the context of the time she has spent in both Houses and with regard to her previous career - and she can bring it to bear on the debate surrounding the Hague Convention so that we might make the changes that need to be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Deputy Finian McGrath focussed on fostering.  Foster parents are the unsung heroes.  They bring the children of others into their families and give them love and provide them with stability, often in circumstances in which they have never experienced either.  Foster parents set children on a course that leads them to experience the type of happiness and success in later life which they might not otherwise have enjoyed.  Following a period with a particular family, the children will either move on to another family or back to their own.  However, they will always carry the influence to which I refer with them.  The foster parents will then take on other children.  In the absence of a robust fostering system, this country - indeed the world - would be a great deal worse off.  There are probably hundreds of thousands of people who have had the benefit, love and wisdom of a foster parent that has shaped their future in a much better way than it otherwise might have been.  While everybody accepts that adoption in certain circumstances is the best way, there is no doubt that foster parents give huge love and guidance, and we should not forget them in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">At some stage this year - maybe next year - we will have a children's referendum.  I would like it to be a stand-alone referendum.  I would be concerned if we have a children's referendum that is being piled on top of other referenda.  There was talk of a super-referendum day.  I hope we learned the lesson from last October.  A children's referendum will be very complex, no matter what the intentions are, which we all share.  Every sort of spin will be put on it.  From having sat through some of the committee meetings, I know that the most honourable of intentions and the most desirable of outcomes are spun and twisted in a way that no one could ever have imagined.  In the course of a referendum campaign and given some of the groups that will be involved, that will happen.  We need the space for one referendum and only one question.  Let nothing else get in the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The time of year is also important.  People need to give this time and we in this House need to give it time, but it has been dragging on.  We have seen different versions of proposed questions.  The time has come to draw a line under the debate and put the question to the people, before winter, in order that they can get involved in a rational discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">I hope that all the groups who have participated to date will get involved in the referendum.  A great amount of effort and time has gone towards the referendum in this House over six or seven years.  Many Members who were involved in it have moved on.  All I want is a rational debate.  Is it too much to ask that we have that?  We are talking about children who deserve a rational debate and the utmost protection.  People will oppose whatever we come up with, so let us remember who we are talking about and who is at the heart of what we are trying to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">I commend the Adoption Authority of Ireland, which has been very strong with its new mandate.  I wish the Minister well as she carries on with her role.  I plead for a rational discussion on the issues that are to be debated.  There should be no super-referendum and there should only be one question on children's rights.  That is what we owe the children of this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_965">Like other Members, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is clearly a very emotional issue for everyone, but for the families involved, it is an all-consuming and life-determining matter.  The Minister clearly has a huge interest in it.  I accept Deputy Calleary's point, but it is welcome that the Government has given her a full Ministry in charge of looking after our children, who are without doubt the most important resource we have.  I congratulate her on her recent visit to Vietnam and on the progress that has been made there.  I also congratulate the Vietnamese.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">I am member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I know that the chairman of the committee, Deputy Breen, also attended with the Minister.  I had the pleasure of discussing his trip with him.  It is perhaps one of the hidden benefits of the committee work that is being done by some great public representatives on the ground, bringing their experience from this country to countries that have significantly fewer resources than we do, and then coming back and reporting to us on how things are going.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">The Hague Convention comes into force in Vietnam shortly.  That is partially what gives rise to the discussion of this issue today.  All politicians encounter families that are involved in the adoption and fostering processes.  We need to acknowledge what I would see as the two core principles of the Hague Convention.  First, it should be in the best interests of the child to be adopted.  Second, there needs to be parental consent.  Our committee spent a number of months discussing the effectiveness of Irish aid, and we get to meet many of the NGOs that are working in developing countries around the world.  There is no doubt that we have a magnificent network of organisations working on the ground.  We may have lost a lot integrity in other areas, but the work of our NGOs abroad is one of the reasons Ireland is held in such high esteem.  We need to try to use this network abroad to ensure that some of the aid we donate goes to determining that people are not forced into putting their children up for adoption for economic reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">I remember the big debate 20 years ago about adoptions from Romania.  The issue moved to Vietnam two or three years ago, and recently we have seen disturbing reports coming from Mexico.  We have a wealth of experience that perhaps is unwelcome but can be very helpful, because 20 years before Romania, we were on the other side of the adoptive process.  Many Irish mothers and many Irish people ended up in other countries around the world through poor and bad practices of which we are now very critical in other countries.  However, that reality gives us the bona fides in trying to help countries engage with the Hague Convention and putting the rights of children first, which everyone believes is the most important issue.  That is not to say there cannot be many possibilities for children from the developing world to come to the developed world.  There are still huge opportunities for Irish families to adopt from within the Hague agreement structure.  We should use our experience and bona fides to go to other countries, not as a rich western country that is lecturing a country trying to adopt proper and fair procedures but as a country that has been there before and that can show empathy and act in the best interests of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_969">I compliment the work that is being done by the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  Its members show great compassion and I am sure they are very pleased that we now have a full Ministry that can develop this process for families that deserve the opportunity to adopt and live fulfilling lives with their children.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_484">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell</from>
          <p eId="para_970">I acknowledge the respect and sensitivity reflected today by all Deputies who have spoken on this important and delicate issue.  The outstanding progress made over recent months on intercountry adoptions is a result of the commitment and dedication of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and her officials along with the ongoing work of the Adoption Authority of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">Two years ago 19 families, with 200 in application stages, had their hopes crushed when the adoption process broke down between Ireland and Vietnam.  In the space of one month after taking office, the Minister had taken the matter in hand by requesting personal engagement between Vietnamese officials and the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  This is a commendable action to have taken.  To have come to a solution within this period of time is an enormous achievement and I trust it has given encouragement and hope to those affected by the setbacks of several years ago, as well as those tentatively considering adoption as a possible option.  It is a very positive step for the Vietnamese to adopt the Hague Convention which will come into force in Vietnam on 1 February.  I take the opportunity to commend them for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_972">I understand a lot of work has yet to be done and that those in the process of being considered eligible to adopt have a long and complicated process to complete.  The sad reality is that couples turn to adoption as their last hope to have a family of their own.  Unfortunately, at this stage most will have been through years of trauma, in coming to terms with the life-changing realisation that they will not be able to have biological children of their own.  Years of hoping and subsequent failing to start a family take their toll, emotionally and financially.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The expense and ordeal in exhausting every possible fertility treatment available can, with the uncertainty and disappointment that come with it, mean that someone can be very vulnerable by the time they enter the adoption process.  To consider that at this stage a couple will be met with the complicated and lengthy process that is necessary but not always successful is reason enough to hope and strive for improvement.  It puts a large responsibility on the country's adoption services to ensure the process is made as straightforward and pain free as possible.  Therefore, the procedures in place must be of the highest standards for their sake and that of the child.  This is of the upmost importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The safety and care of the child are at the heart of the matter and certainty is to be found by way of the Hague Convention.  This will ensure the vital high standards of the process are sustained, ensuring safety and peace of mind for the child and family involved.  However, we must remain vigilant, including, as was illustrated recently, countries that have signed the Hague Convention, as well as families attempting to adopt.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The Government and the Irish Adoption Authority must ensure the process takes no longer than 12 to 18 months once parents have been certified as suitable candidates.  This is particularly relevant in the light of the victims innocently caught up in the illegal adoption cases in Mexico which have caused such pain to those involved.  This scenario is every adoptive parent's worst nightmare, traumatic for all involved and must be avoided.  Notwithstanding this, I sincerely welcome anything that can be done within the limits of the Adoption Act to make the process quicker for genuine adoption cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">I pay tribute to the amazing work done by the huge number of foster families who care for in excess of 95% of the 6,000 children in the care of the State.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge them.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">I welcome the decision to review the flexibilities offered by the Adoption Act 2010, whereby countries that have not ratified the Hague Convention can still enter into a bilateral agreement with Ireland.  I support the Minister's proactive, yet cautionary, approach in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">I acknowledge the commitment of and the work the Minister has put in in the past few months, with particular reference to her personal engagements on behalf of people in Ireland and to ensure the rights and protection of children in Vietnam.  I know the Adoption Authority of Ireland was by her side at every step.  I am optimistic that this will give hope to those undergoing this process and that they themselves recognise the importance of having a safe and secure method of adoption which is in the best interests of the child and of the future of the family.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_485">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_979">This is a very important discussion on an issue which has, in many ways, been dogged by scandal because of practices followed in various countries.  It is also an issue encompassing many conflicting rights.  The discussion in an Irish context has been very much focused on the welfare and rights of prospective adoptive parents.  I recognise those who find themselves in this situation often face a rigorous ordeal and endure stress in very emotive circumstances, jumping through bureaucratic hoops and expending vast quantities of money to fulfil their a desire to have a child they can call their own and for whom they can provide a suitable upbringing.  This is a worthy objective and I understand absolutely matters from their viewpoint.  In this sense, the frustration and lobbying are clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">That said, there are other rights which must be given equal weight; in fact, I argue they are greater.  They are the rights of the natural parents, in particular the mother, and those of the children at the centre of the debate.  We must step back and look at the issue in this context.  Looking at the countries from which children have been adopted in the past, almost all of them have been shut amid scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">The majority of the media have been negligent in reporting on these situations, looking at them solely from the point of view of the desperation of Irish parents who want to adopt, rather than at the other issues revealed.  It is interesting that the media focused so much on the 19 or 20 couples who desperately wanted to adopt from Vietnam and the difficulties they faced but scandalously ignored the up to 55,000 adults adopted in Ireland, many of them illegally.  They desperately need to access records, obtain information on their natural parents and move on with their lives in a comprehensive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">In a certain sense, there are double standards in this regard because in the past Ireland was a huge exporter of children, much to our shame.  The hidden scandal behind these stories has not yet been touched on.  We possess certain knowledge, but there needs to be a greater unearthing of information.  Now, there is a similar situation in other countries where it has been revealed that, in many instances, people in poor and difficult socio-economic circumstances have been preyed upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">In Ireland when we did not provide support for women to keep their children, there were record levels of adoptions.  It was only when State subsistence payments for lone parents came into being that the numbers of adopted children fell.  Ideally most women and parents want to rear the children to whom they give birth in a loving home, but many were denied this opportunity and had to turn to adoption.  This is the choice being faced by many people in other countries, of which we must be extremely mindful, as well as of the rights of the children at the centre.  We must be to the forefront in advancing scenarios where children can remain with their natural parents, of if they are to be adopted, in their own country.  This is an important context in which to place the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">Vietnam is the country being discussed with regard to the rights of adoptive parents.  However, we must ask why Barry Andrews decided not to renew the bilateral agreement with it in 2009.  Despite acknowledging the difficulties for the parents involved, he was right to do this.  Vietnam is continuously ranked as one of the most popular countries of origin for intercountry adoptions.  At least 10,000 children have been adopted from there in the past decade.  Prior to the bilateral agreement lapsing, Irish people had adopted more than 600 children from Vietnam between 2002 and 2008, three times the number adopted from Canada and significantly more than the number adopted from countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark.  Russia was the only country from which Irish people had adopted more children during that period.  This was against the backdrop of reports from UNICEF and the US State Department on cases which had been described as baby buying, baby farming, fraud, corruption and so-called humanitarian aid intervening to develop a market in babies.  There were studies from the US State Department describing what was in place as a network of adoption agency representatives, orphanage directors, hospital administrators and police and government officials, all of whom had profited financially by coercing and defrauding the natural parents of children who had been paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">These were the serious scenarios behind the scenes and while it is the case that Vietnam has established a central adoption authority and is required to sign the Hague Convention on inter-country adoptions, which is welcome, given what we know from UNICEF about the adoption practices that continued in that country during the bilateral agreement phase, how certain can we be that adoption procedures there are now acceptable because what went on was far from acceptable?  Will the Minister indicate if there will be monitoring of the position in Vietnam?  This is crucial because previous reports cited concerns that there was virtually no active promotion of domestic adoptions to allow children to remain in their country of birth and outlined many other scenarios which are too upsetting to read.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">In that context, we must address cases such as those that occurred in other countries.  The Minister referred to Mexico.  The total number of adoptions from Mexico by Irish people was 92, a substantial number of children.  We are also aware that a Mexican lawyer by the name of Lopez is being sought by the police.  It has been stated he has arranged 60 adoptions from Mexico for Irish couples, yet the Adoption Authority of Ireland is on record as stating all adoptions of Mexican children by Irish couples are safe.  Both scenarios cannot be correct.  How can the authority state they are safe if the Mexican authorities are seeking an individual whom it has been stated has arranged two thirds of the adoptions referred to?  We must, therefore, do more in that regard.  Mexico is not safe.  We must, therefore, stand back from the process and the Minister should call the Adoption Authority of Ireland to account for the conflicting statements being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">Ethiopia has also been in the spotlight.  I would be reticent about dealing with that country.  There are United States' reports on corruption, fraud and so on fuelling foreign adoptions.  The numbers of children available for adoption from Ethiopia have greatly increased in the past ten years.  In that context, we cannot be sure the practices being followed inside the country are safe because the reality is, as our own history demonstrates, that when supports are provided for parents, the numbers of children available for adoption fall.  There are fewer children available for adoption from those countries covered by the Hague Convention.  This causes problems for prospective adoptive parents but protects the rights of children which must be at the heart of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">The Minister has serious questions to ask of the Adoption Authority of Ireland about its role in some of these cases and its assessment of some of the criteria to be met.  We must also be mindful of, not just acknowledge, our history and try to do much more for the 55,000 adults adopted here who have been let down by the systems in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_989">I call Deputy Kevin Humphreys who I understand is sharing time with Deputy Ciara Conway.  The Deputies have five minutes each.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KevinHumphreys" eId="spk_487">
          <from>Deputy Kevin Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_990">I thank the Minister for facilitating the debate.  This is an important issue that affects many families.  Adoption can be a frustrating process but one that can bring much joy when concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The rights of the children must be at the centre of the process of inter-country adoption.  Everybody in this House will always put the rights of the child first but my focus, bearing in mind what Deputy Daly has just outlined, is on Ethiopia.  I have spoken to many families that have adopted children from Ethiopia.  In 2010, there were 75 adoptions from Ethiopia with over 300 children adopted in the past 20 years.  Having spoken to those parents I am aware they dealt with reputable orphanages.  The ambassador in Ethiopia was very helpful in assisting those parents when they travelled to the country and ensuring the adoptions were done in a correct manner in difficult circumstances but Ethiopia, as a non-signatory of the Hague Convention on inter-country adoption, is now closed off to Irish parents and only those cases that were under way can proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">It is worth noting that the ratification of the Hague Convention can be an expensive process for developing countries.  Even when in place the guarantees it provides are not clear.  That was outlined earlier by Deputy Daly in terms of what happened in Mexico, which is a signatory to the Hague Convention, the question marks over the practices of the Mexican establishment and the way they were managed, which would have been distressing for the children and the Irish families that travelled to Mexico who were in a terrible position.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Significant legal protections and guidelines must be met before new adoptions can begin in Ethiopia.  We have a strong Irish network in Ethiopia on which we can build.  I urge the Minister to consider that and put a timeline on the process.  I realise the discussions are in the early stages but I know the Minister for many years and I know she will guarantee best practices to the best of her ability.  She will leave no stone unturned in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">The families that have adopted children want to see their family grow.  They want the next child they adopt to be from Ethiopia and to be aware of his or her culture and identity.  Having spoken with the parents I know that is very important to them, and they have organised support groups in Ireland for the adopted children.  It would be useful if the Minister could provide a timeline for the Ethiopian situation to give the families some certainty.  Furthermore, if she could confirm the length of this process it would be very reassuring for families.  With every step we take and because of our own history in this State we must ensure that the children are protected and that what is best for those children is acted upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">I thank the Minister for the opportunity to debate this issue.  Funding was made available last year to consider South Africa as a Hague country but it decided not to continue.  If an expense is to be incurred it would be welcome if it was in the direction of Ethiopia.  We should examine the prospect of allowing families to grow if that is at all possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_488">
          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
          <p eId="para_996">I thank the Minister and the House for the opportunity to speak on this important issue, which is close to my heart, having two adopted sisters, one from Ireland and one from Romania who is 21 years of age and would have been one of the first intercountry adoptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">I wish to speak on the issues mentioned by Deputies Daly and Humphreys, that is, how we can protect the rights of the child.  The last thing any adoptive parent wants is to upset the birth mother.  They have suffered enough anguish not being able to have a child of their own.  The decision to adopt is not easily made.  They know the hurt that can be caused and the disappointment that is felt by not being able to have their own birth family.  They would not want a child given to them, which I have no doubt they would love and rear and give every opportunity, knowing that the birth mother in the country of origin has been led up the garden path.  We have heard harrowing stories of young women in Mexico who were bribed with flashy prams.  They were told they would be given the money to buy a new pram and all the new things that any new mother wants to provide for her child and that they would use the children for photo shoots.  The Irish parents were lured into thinking they were having an adoption.  When the mother did not consent to the adoption they were told they had to repay €12,000, €3,000 or whatever amount - an enormous amount of money for those living well below the poverty line in Mexico.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">Deputy Daly made a good point when she said we have to look at the circumstances and the country of origin of the children.  The last thing any prospective adoptive parent wants is that they are somehow keeping the birth mother from their child because we have a torrid history of exporting children to other countries for adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">There is a lack of services post adoption.  Barnardos is the only service available to parents post adoption.  Much of the emphasis is on the process, which is worthwhile in terms of preparation, the assessment of parents for suitability and the placement of the child.  Following on from that one is very much on one's own.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">An intercountry adoption can sometimes raise issues for the child and the parents that are unexpected, such as cultural issues or, perhaps, behavioural issues.  That is perfectly understandable given the major change because some of the children can be three and four years of age before being adopted.  There is a severe lack of services for parents and children in terms of making a successful and happy transition for the child and the parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">In the next couple of weeks HIQA will publish its guidelines on social work practice.  I take this opportunity to ask that those guidelines be merged with Children First and other guidelines published by the Department in recent weeks in order that social workers who have a huge caseload and who, in the case of adoption and fostering, are trying to get on with the important work of assessing people, will not be asked to adhere to three sets of guidelines.  It is important that standards are in place to ensure the procedures are rigorous and thorough and that unnecessary bureaucracy is cut out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">There have been many calls during the debate to speed up the process.  It is important to take our time to ensure the children are placed with appropriate families.  Fifteen months is not an extraordinarily long period to wait; in fact it is reasonable.  It is a huge decision, not only for the parents and children they may already have in the home but for the child.  The decision that will be taken in a 15 month period will affect the child for the rest of his or her life.  No social worker or professional working in that area would be happy to allow an assessment go through in less than that time.  Notwithstanding that, there are other issues that hold up the process unnecessarily.  The assessment of families and prospective adoptive and foster parents must be rigorous to ensure children get the best opportunity that can be afforded to them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonHarris" eId="spk_489">
          <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
          <p eId="para_1003">Like other Deputies, I welcome the opportunity to be provided with this forum to speak on the important issue of intercountry adoptions.  Clearly this is an issue which is of great interest to many families, considering Ireland has one of the highest rates of intercountry adoption across Europe.  For the children and the families involved in the adoption process this is a significant undertaking with consequences for several years before, during and after the adoption process.  My colleague, Deputy Farrell, mentioned the range of emotions, concerns and stresses from time to time that parents and families in these situations experience.  I have learned much from the debate which has been very reasoned and informative.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Deputy Ó Caoláin's contribution was extremely informative to a new Deputy like me in terms of providing an overview of how far we have come.  That we have a new Department of Children and Youth Affairs has provided the Oireachtas with time that, perhaps, a previous Oireachtas have not had to discuss issues regarding children and youth affairs.  That is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Clearly, the Minister has achieved much in a short period in terms of providing clarity on a number of the issues she has inherited.  Her trip to Vietnam showed the process and the progress that can be made through direct intervention.  The decision to incorporate the Hague Convention directly into Irish law in 2010 was welcome in that the convention is geared towards ensuring the integrity of the adoption process and, crucially, as Deputy Ciara Conway called for, protecting the rights of adopted children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">However, some families who had already engaged in the adoption process prior to the coming into force of the agreement have been left in a legal limbo.  The Minister is aware of this.  They have done everything by the book, followed all the rules of the Irish State that existed at the time and went through the lengthy process.  They, too, have had the interest of the child at heart but find they cannot have the adoptions registered in Ireland as a result.  This issue was highlighted by the Ombudsman for Children in November 2009, prior to the enactment of the Adoption Act.  Great credit must go to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children for that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">I welcome the direct and personal engagement of the Minister in that area.  Her recent visit to Vietnam has produced positive results and has allowed her to raise the cases of 19 families, who have been in such limbo since these adoptions were stopped two years ago, in her conversations with the Vietnamese justice minister.  I am glad to hear that these families and the 200 families who have already been assessed will be prioritised when adoptions resume shortly.  An indication of progress is that the Minister has asked her officials and the Adoption Authority to explore the possibility of establishing a bilateral agreement with Ethiopia.  This will come as good news to many families and potential adoptive parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">There are some broader issues I wish to highlight.  One family with whom I came in contact outlined the obstacles they face in finalising an adoption from Florida.  I understand there are approximately 20 other couples in roughly the same position.  They said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1009">We have fallen into a gap with regard to having our adoptions registered in Ireland as a result of the implementation of the Hague Convention into Irish law.  It appears that the Adoption Authority are refusing to consider registering any of these adoptions.  They seem to be basing this view on the understanding that if the adoption was finalised after the Hague Convention was implemented into Irish law then the adoption should be subject to the rules and regulations of the Hague Convention.  Of course, this approach, [in their own words] completely ignores the fact, as the adoption process in their case began over five years ago, it could not possibly have been carried out in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Hague Convention, which were not part of either Irish law or US law at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">This is a matter on which I have corresponded with the Minister and raised through parliamentary question.  This is a family that has completed the adoption process in Florida.  I raise this as an example of a challenge facing about two dozen families.  They did everything correctly.  They carried out the adoption process to the letter of the law and, as far as the Florida authorities are concerned, that adoption has gone through and that child has been formally adopted.  That child lives here with that family in Ireland.  However, they still cannot register their adoption with the Adoption Authority in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">The Minister will understand, appreciate and empathise with the great stress and concern associated with that.  Anything that can be done to regularise these arrangements, primarily in the interests of the child, would be welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">A related issue brought to my attention involved a family which had adopted two children from Vietnam before the ratification of the Hague Convention.  The agency through which they completed the adoption was not accredited after the Hague Convention was ratified.  As a result, the post-placement reports for the adoption authority which the family were required to complete are no longer being sent to the agency in Vietnam.  Consequently, this family, through no fault of its own, finds itself to be in breach of a binding legal agreement.  While this specific case may now be resolved since the Hague Convention has entered into force in Vietnam on 1 February, this will allow the Adoption Authority of Ireland to begin the process accrediting Vietnamese agencies.  However, the issues highlighted by the family relate not only to Vietnam but to other countries with which Ireland has had bilateral agreements prior to the Hague Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">I recognise the excellent work currently being undertaken by the Adoption Authority of Ireland in working with signatories of the Hague Convention and other countries to ensure processes are in place which protect the best interests of children in the adoption process.  The recent events in Mexico serve as a stark, tangible and real reminder of the importance of this.  It is important that anomalous situations created by the ratification of the Hague Convention are addressed comprehensively as a matter of urgency.  It would be most unfortunate to have a situation whereby families are allowed to fall through the gaps created by the Hague Convention through no fault of their own.  Anything that can be done by the Department and the authority to regularise those who played by the rules and who put the interests of children first would be appreciated.  I welcome the Minister's decision to grant approval to the AAI to examine the feasibility of introducing a bilateral agreement in Ethiopia.  I understand a similar review is taking place in respect of Kazakhstan which has ratified the Hague Convention and I would welcome any update on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">I thank the Minister and I commend her on her commitment to keeping public representatives appraised of the progress made in establishing the necessary processes and to ensure that intercountry adoptions that safeguard the rights of the child can proceed.  I am contacted frequently, as are many public representatives, by families seeking an update on the work of the adoption authority.  I praise the adoption authority, in particular the chairman, Mr. Geoffrey Shannon, who operates in a voluntary capacity and does such excellent work.  However, in the interests of providing a regular flow of information in terms of providing fact and assurance to families, it would be useful if the Minister in conjunction with the AAI considered establishing a similar information flow for public representatives to that provided by the HSE, the immigration service and NAMA.  This would be a positive step in keeping us informed and appraised and it would place the responsibility on Members and legislators to keep abreast of these important issues regarding child protection and adoption.  The families involved do not seek to influence the work of the adoption authority.  Its independence and its application of the guidelines must be paramount and sacrosanct.  However, it is important that there is a constant flow of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">I refer to some issues which arose during the debate.  Deputy McConalogue referred to the Minister's intention to hold a referendum on children's rights.  I agree with him, as do many Deputies, that it is desirable to hold this referendum on its own.  I am keen to see a referendum proceed with children as its exclusive focus.  Any political wrangling or posturing that other referendums inevitably generate would be best parked on the day.  I call on the Minister will examine the feasibility of this and to consider the matter carefully, since she is determined to get the best outcome.  I disagree somewhat with Deputy McConalogue in another way and Deputy Conway also alluded to this in another area.  We are keen to have these developments as soon as possible but we are also keen to get them right.  This aim must supersede any political desire or temptation to hold a referendum in the morning.  I understand from the Minister's public comments that she shares this view and understands this reality.  We only have one opportunity to get the best possible constitutional framework for children's rights.  We urge the Minister to get it done as quickly as possible.  However long it takes, the Minister will have my support and the overwhelming support of most Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">Deputy Finian McGrath referred to surrogacy.  This is a real issue for many families.  We need guidelines and clarification on surrogacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">We must also examine how the Child Care Act interacts with the Refugee Act especially at the stage when the child becomes an adult in the eyes of the law on reaching 18 years of age.  I have raised this issue previously with the Minister during Oral Questions in the House.  We must ensure that regardless of whether children are adopted, any child who enters the State is cared for in a compassionate way.  Work must be carried out involving the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">The Minister managed to achieve what many doubted she would achieve - I always knew she would - on the issue of social work commitments in the Ryan report and the provision of extra social workers.  She is to be commended on this.  However, there appears to be a geographic imbalance.  In my constituency of County Wicklow I have heard alarming reports that the level of provision of social workers for child and family issues is down.  I call on the Minister to pay attention to my constituency, to address the anomaly and to ensure a correct geographic spread to cater for the needs of children.  I thank her again and I commend her on her work.  I look forward to continuing to contribute on these issues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Patrick O’Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_1019">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I compliment the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on their vision in assigning ministries and in establishing the new Departments.  I have not had the chance to say as much directly on the floor of the House.  In some ways it is a terrible indictment of the country and in other ways it is a great mark of a country that it took us until 2011 to establish a fully-fledged Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I congratulate and compliment the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, on the work she has done in a short period.  I echo the sentiments of previous speakers especially in respect of the staff in the Minister's office.  Anyone who has worked with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would agree that the staff of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, at the Civil Service grades and at advisory grades are exemplary.  The Minister is lucky to have excellent people working for her and I would appreciate it if she relayed my compliments to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">These issues probably affect every Member.  There is no doubt that at some stage during a representative's time in the Oireachtas a family will probably present at a clinic or office and will recount the difficulties they have had with regard to intercountry adoptions.  It may be an easy option to consider intercountry adoption as something associated to the developing world or, as it was known heretofore, the Third World.  However, this is not always the case.  We are in a position in Ireland whereby we are engaging in intercountry adoptions with First World or developed countries.  Sometimes people experience considerable difficulties with these nations as well.  It is important not to single out particular categories of country or to label some countries as troublesome and others as trouble-free in our dealings with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">I concur with Deputy Harris.  Issues may arise when one deals with federal countries in which there are different family law arrangements within the same national boundary.  We have seen as much in respect of Florida recently.  This adds a layer of complexity to what is already a very complex situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">In recent times we have focused on the need to reduce costs and the cost base and to remove layers of civil servants and so on.  One area that could be of considerable benefit to the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and her Department is our diplomatic network throughout the world.  It could carry out a great deal of the preliminary work in building up relationships and smoothing out any creases in terms of Ireland's relationship with countries from which we are trying to adopt.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">I break no secret by stating that I held a productive meeting with the Minister in the not-too-distant past.  I relayed to her a concern in respect of a particular issue with a European country, namely Belarus.  It is fully compliant with the Hague Convention now and there is willingness to try to put back on the agenda the good working relationship that existed previously.  There is an amenable atmosphere in the Department in this regard.  I realise the Minister is up to her eyes at the moment with the Vietnam issue and that she is attempting to regularise the situation with Ethiopia but there is potential to consider countries a good deal closer to home and to regularise our relationship with them in terms of intercountry adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">I refer to an experience I have related to the Minister previously.  It is harrowing for a family when they must wait and when they do not know the position and when there are false starts and no-starts.  It is nobody's fault.  I would not put blame on anybody, but we cannot lose sight of the child who is at the centre of each intercountry adoption from the United States, Mexico or China.  We must maintain our focus on him or her.  Ultimately, we need to put in place the best legal framework for each child who needs to be at the centre of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Deputy Simon Harris spoke about the children's rights referendum.  People have been asking the Minister when it will take place.  I would prefer not to have it this year, next year or the year after if it means the proposal will be a bad one.  Any constitutional amendment needs to be dealt with properly from the start.  We need to spend time consulting the various interests involved.  For the first time since 1937 when Bunreacht na hÉireann was enacted by the people, we will be inserting in the Constitution a series of rights for children living in Ireland today who were born of Irish parentage or who may be adopted by Irish parents and become Irish citizens in the future.  We need to be cognisant of the current and future needs of the children of Ireland and children in other countries who may be the subject of intercountry adoptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I pay tribute to the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  There is a tendency in this country to denigrate public institutions and civil servants.  However, the impression I have gleaned from the parents who have spoken to me is that the staff of the Adoption Authority of Ireland are very understanding and humane.  They put the interests of parents on the table when talking to public representatives.  Deputy Simon Harris suggested officials within the authority could form a parliamentary affairs division to deal specifically with parliamentary queries.  That might reduce the number of parliamentary questions being asked.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_1031">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topical matter for debate.  I have serious concerns about the wording of the statutory instrument published by the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, this afternoon.  The statutory instrument which contains some vague language could have serious consequences for established online freedoms in Ireland.  It appears to give the courts open-ended powers to grant orders against Internet service providers, even though no legislative instructions have been introduced to set the boundaries.  Like the vast majority of people who have contacted me, I recognise that artists have an absolute right to profit from their work.  That aspect of the matter can be parked immediately.  However, it is just part of the issue.  Under the current wording, a court may seek to block any website with which a user has linked to access infringing material.  It leaves it entirely to the courts to decide the grounds on which an injunction may be granted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">The Government is abdicating its responsibility by not introducing primary legislation.  I do not doubt the Minister of State's personal intent.  However, it is not a question of what he intends to do, rather it is a question of what he is enabling the courts to do.  The vagueness I have mentioned could result, by stealth, in this country having laws that resemble the toxic SOPA approach that has been resisted in the United States.  This must be enacted through primary legislation.  We must give the courts something to interpret.  Our job is to do the groundwork by introducing legislation.  It is important for us to safeguard this country's international reputation in the technology sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">Will the Minister of State confirm that under the proposed wording, it will not be possible to take out an injunction against a company such as Google, eBay, Facebook or Twitter?  Google alone employs 4,000 people in Ireland.  This controversy has been discussed on one of the most referenced websites in the world, <i>www.wired.co.uk</i>, which is read by those working for technology companies.  We are constantly told to be conscious of the country’s reputation in the money markets.  I know the Minister of State appreciates that this is a important area for us.  However, I am concerned about the vagueness of the language and the powers being transferred to the courts.</p>

            <from>Deputy Derek Keating</from>
            <p eId="para_1034">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this important issue which is the subject of considerable confusion.  This debate gives him an opportunity to clarify the issues involved and put people's minds at ease.  The anti-counterfeiting trade agreement which is seen as an international version of the controversial SOPA legislation in the United States aims to tackle counterfeit goods.  However, it is possible that start-up and more established online businesses might suffer as a result of it.  Potentially, a broad range of images, videos and tracks could be deemed to infringe copyright.  Does the Minister of State have a plan in place to provide assistance for parties that might need help in this regard?  Has he considered how such a proposition might hinder this country's information technology industry?  We depend on businesses in sectors such as information technology, tourism, sport and social media.  Many think we need protection and clarification in this area.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to provide it today.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation  (Deputy Sean Sherlock)</from>
            <p eId="para_1035">I will begin by confirming that this is absolutely not a version of the SOPA legislation.  It is a restatement of a position on copyright that the Government has held to be the case.  The Charleton judgment in the case of EMI <i>v</i>. UPC held that Ireland was not <i>ad idem</i> with the EU copyright directive.  We are implementing a statutory instrument to give voice to that judgment and bring us into line with the directive.  The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 was implemented in the State.  Every member state of the European Union has the right to seek an injunction, in line with EU legislation, in the event of a perceived infringement of the copyright of a party.  Prior to the Charleton judgment, to which we were not a party, our position was that we were in line with EU legislation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_1037">I do not have one.  When Mr. Justice Charleton issued his judgment, we considered it was best to remove any doubt by restating our position, as set out in the 2000 Act.  That is what is before us today - an amendment to the Act to ensure we are in line with the judgment.  Every member state has the right to seek an injunction in the event of a perceived breach of copyright.  Before a judge makes a decision he or she will need to have regard to the e-commerce directive which states there are inherent rights in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to freedom of expression and that the copyright directive provides that an Internet service-provider has the right to conduct a business and to have regard to the right of ordinary users to be able to use the Internet freely and openly.  We would not seek to prejudice this right in any way.  I am the Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  The State funds new technologies, the development of web-based technologies to the tune of millions of euro annually and we very conscious of the need to continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">I take Deputy Murphy's point about the abdication of responsibility.  However, I respectfully suggest to the Deputy that we need to see a dialogue, an engagement, between the Internet service-providers on one hand, the copyright holders on the other side and a space in between for a very highly active Internet web-based community.  They all need to sit down together to chart a way forward.  Personally, I am not averse to the notion of primary legislation but no matter what action is decided upon, we must have regard to the Charlton judgment.  If, prior to this judgment, the State already held that a person could seek infringement proceedings where a breach of copyright is perceived and there have been no sites closed down as a result, we are merely restating what is in the Copyright Act or adding to it, then it is logical to assume there will not be a move to close down further websites.</p>

            <p eId="para_1041">The issue definitely warrants more time.  The programme for Government states the intention to introduce primary legislation to deal with EU regulations but this has not happened.  A debate is urgently required.  There has already been an e-mail storm on this issue and we are about to see a hurricane if people are not satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">There is a contradiction in some of the points made by the Minister of State.  On one hand he does not want the courts to enforce unlimited blocking of websites yet on the other hand he wants the court to be able to grant injunctions which would block a site in its entirety.  This is my understanding.</p>

Because of its vagueness, this has the potential to do damage.  If there is sufficient time allowed to have a debate, a question and answer session, much of the questions could be properly teased out.  If this topical debate is the beginning and end of the debate, it will be insufficient.  A debate on this matter is needed within the next week.</p>

            <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock</from>
            <p eId="para_1047">I reiterate the point that no national authority or court can require an Internet service-provider to carry out general monitoring of the information it transmits on its network.  That gives rights to the Internet service-provider and to the individual IP address or the individual user.  This means the ISP cannot be asked to monitor all the data of each of its customers in order to prevent any future infringement of intellectual property rights.  This is clearly stated in EU law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">We are attempting to balance the right of the copyright holder and to transpose that which is already in EU law and then to recognise the rights of the individual user, the individual business and not to limit the freedoms of the Internet.  Nobody wants to limit the freedoms of the Internet because this is counter-intuitive.  We live in a democracy and we thrive on the businesses we have created in this country, through State intervention and subsidies which support those types of businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The business model pertaining to the music industry is increasingly and arguably - I will not use the word outmoded - an evolving process.  So long as it is a case of never the twain shall meet, then no matter how one legislates primarily in this field, as soon as one legislates, the Internet, of its very nature, will evolve in a way to circumnavigate the legislation.  In my view, the stakeholders must sit down together in an organic fashion because if they do not reach an agreement then no matter what Government is in power, it will never be able to legislate for this issue.  Given the level of activity on the Internet, which is to be welcomed, and the level of innovation, no one member state, no one geographical boundary, can set laws to try to control it.  This is a commonly-held view to a certain extent.  I think a liberal view is taken, in the main, regarding the power of the Internet and its inherent good.  However, as an EU member state, Ireland must have regard to copyright law.  Anyone who generates intellectual property has a right but that right is not superior to the right of the Internet service-provider nor superior to the right of the individual user.  When governments legislate, they must be very careful.</p>

The common denominator is that the areas being attacked have suffered through the years from deprivation.  These cuts are seen as a direct attack by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">The work being done is second to none and cannot be replicated.  There is a suggestion that the local authority or Garda might replicate this work but they cannot.  A wide range of activities is organised to address the high levels of anti-social behaviour, including diversionary programmes for young people and a particular focus on anti-social behaviour.  I will provide an example for the Minister of State.  In the past week two houses in the area I represent have been petrol bombed and a pipe bomb has been left outside a family's door.  These exemplify some of the problems happening in the areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">These workers are the glue holding the communities together.  What can the Minister of State do to reverse the cuts?  These workers are involved with anti-racism action, Tallaght Travellers, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, senior citizens, the RAPID programme, anti-social units, social inclusion, the planning and roads department in the local authority, housing projects, local schools, coffee dock management, the developing and support of a local creche, the Dodder Valley partnership, drugs task forces, the HSE, young mothers, new communities, family support and estate management.  The Minister of State is talking about removing such a service in March, which is absolutely crazy.  We must formulate alternatives.</p>

They are unique as their origins are from within the community; the people who organise and work within the projects live in the community.  The activities just mentioned are carried out within these projects, and there is a wide variety of responsibilities within the community.  Both of these are traditional working class estates and we could be here until midnight listing the sort of work they have done over the past 20 years.  These are difficult times and the people involved, who I have met, appreciate that.  If there is some way around this, we would be grateful for the Minister of State's help.</p>

            <p eId="para_1070">The damage and devastation of heroin addiction is so widespread and great that it is often referred to nowadays in biblical terms with words like "scourge" and "plague".  Heroin addiction represents a great problem for individuals, families and entire communities.  It is a challenge to every one of our social structures and our political system, which has not always responded well.  Perhaps the best political response came from Labour Party Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who initiated the local drugs task forces when a Minister of State.  These enabled communities to intervene with the likes of the Ballyfermot Support, Treatment, Aftercare and Rehabilitation, STAR, programme.  It empowered Ms Sunniva Finlay and her team with great skill, competence and insight to intervene in individual lives and work with strategies, therapies and initiatives to allow individuals in big numbers to rediscover themselves, learn new skills, get in touch with themselves and be strengthened to see off the false lure of heroin addiction.  We must stand by projects like STAR in Ballyfermot and safeguard the work done by Ms Finlay and her team.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1071">I appreciate the concerns of the Deputies and have spoken to them individually with regard to these projects.  I realise the work being done in the areas concerned.  My Department had responsibility for the funding of the five mainstreamed drugs projects.  Unfortunately, as part of the Government's comprehensive review of expenditure and the 2012 Estimates process, difficult decisions had to be taken in prioritising funding for core services in all programme areas.  The funding Estimate to support my Department's mainstreamed drugs projects under the housing programme in 2012 is €100,000, compared with €400,000 in 2011, which is a reduction of 75%.  That is the figure I am faced with and because of this significant reduction in the sub-head, it is not possible for my Department to continue funding the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">Once the 2012 funding position became clear, my Department contacted both Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council, which administer the funding on behalf of my Department, in respect of the mainstreamed drugs projects.  My Department requested the councils to notify the projects of the funding position immediately, given that the projects and the relevant local drugs task forces were in the process of determining budgetary matters for 2012, and to ensure that informed decisions could be made in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">A consultation process is under way between the projects in question, Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council, the relevant local drugs task forces, the Department of Health and the HSE with a view to identifying alternative funding mechanisms for the projects for 2012 and beyond.  Accordingly, while this consultation process is under way, my Department has agreed to provide <i>pro rata</i> funding of €47,500 and €52,500 to Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council, respectively, in respect of the mainstreamed drugs projects for the first quarter of 2012.  This represents the final housing budget contribution to the projects and it will be a matter for all the public funding bodies, as part of the consultation process, to identify resources to deliver on the overall objectives of the reconfigured projects beyond end March 2012.  For example, the mainstreamed drugs funding provided by my Department to the STAR project in 2011 of €129,200 represents only 8% of the project’s overall projected expenditure of €1.59 million in 2011.  Similarly, my Department has recently met representatives from South Dublin County Council with regard to broader public funding for the projects and asked them to consider the potential for the estate management projects to be reconfigured in line with the council’s housing management role.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">More broadly, and in the context of the public funding provision of €260 million for drugs programmes across all Departments and agencies in 2011, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, who has responsibility for the national drugs strategy, is currently undertaking a review of the structures that underpin the strategy at local, regional and national level.  This will take in how the current funding structures can be improved or streamlined, particularly with local and regional drugs task forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">I know this sounds stark but I have listened to the strong cases being made by the Deputies.  There is a period to the end of March where funding is in place and there is ongoing consultation.  I will examine the issue again in light of the cases that have been made.</p>

Nobody will replicate the work being done by these people across the board and nobody has the required level of local knowledge.  That would be accepted by all the agencies I mentioned who work with these people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">It will be like a house of cards and if those individuals are pulled from the communities, there will be a knock-on effect on a significant number of projects.  It is not just what these projects are being funded for; in many cases these people do extra work, and they participate on a voluntary basis on boards, for example.  It is a package.  I know the work involves many Departments but somebody must take up the slack.  If the Minister of State's Department cannot do so, the Department of Justice and Equality may be able to do so.  If we save two or three children from going into the justice system, that should save a fortune for the State.  That is a potential outcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_1083">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, for responding to this matter.  I congratulate her on her promotion.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise in the House the need to re-examine the current system of issuing prescriptions in light of what I believe are inefficiencies and inequities created by requiring GPs to reissue all prescriptions from hospital consultants, in particular in the area of mental health services for medical card holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">As the Minister of State will no doubt be aware, the roll out of primary care centres was discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts in great detail this morning.  I believe wholeheartedly, as does the Government, in the rationale behind the move to primary care centres and the need to ensure we can treat as many patients as possible within their own communities, in an effective and streamlined manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">The programme for Government commits to an ambitious programme of reform in this area, one which is essential to the delivery of the best possible standard of health care in this country.  The progress made last year by the special delivery unit shows that advances can be made even at a time when the health service has to face severe financial cutbacks.  To do this, it is essential that all resources are utilised in the most effective manner possible.  It is in this wider context that I wish to raise the need to re-examine the way in which prescriptions are issued to medical card holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">I have been contacted by many constituents frustrated by the system currently in place, where families attending hospital or psychiatric services have to revisit their GP in order to get their prescription re-written as a GMS order to access their entitlement to receive it for free.  This is most pressingly a problem in the case of prescriptions.  Mental health prescriptions are obviously prescribed for very good reason, and often require individuals to take them consistently over a prolonged period.  Depending on the circumstances, prescriptions for these long-term medications are sometimes issued on a weekly basis, requiring the patient to visit the GP for a GMS order every time a prescription is required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">Some modern health medications for treating conditions such as autism can cost up to €300 per month.  If parents are not in a position to see their GP, as I understand was a concern for some families over the Christmas period, they may not be able to afford the cost of the prescription.  That has real consequences for the children and families concerned, and pharmacists have little or no discretion in issuing such prescriptions without a separate GMS order.  The system appears to be extremely bureaucratic.  I would appreciate if the Minister could outline the rationale behind having GMS orders issued in this way, given that it appears to result in a duplication of resources.  Patients see a specialist in a particular field, who prescribes the medication they feel is most suitable.  They then have to revisit their GP in order to obtain a GMS order for the prescription.  This same process takes place when a prescription is issued by a hospital.  That is causing widespread waste of time and inefficiencies and is wasting the time of doctors at a time when the health service is clogged up.  I am informed that while hospitals can use a special form to issue a prescription for up to seven days, in practice this is often not used.  It is not the most practical measure.  The current system can result in additional, unnecessary visits to GPs.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on the matter.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_532" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Community_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1088">The Medical Council's guide to professional conduct and ethics states that "it is in the best interests of the patient that a general practitioner, GP, supervises and guides the overall management of their health".  There are approximately 2,600 GPs in active practice, of which approximately 2,300 hold a contract with the Health Service Executive, HSE, for the provision of services under the general medical services, GMS, scheme to medical card and GP visit card patients.  Approximately 40% of the population is covered by the GMS scheme.  GMS contracted GPs undertake to provide their patients with all proper and necessary treatment of a kind generally undertaken by a GP.  That includes the issuing of a prescription for medicines or drugs as is determined to be necessary by the GP for his or her patient.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">Since 1996 there has been an arrangement under the GMS scheme for the emergency supply of medicines for medical card holders on discharge from hospital.  Community pharmacists participating in the GMS scheme are authorised to dispense a maximum of seven days' supply of medicines prescribed for persons who have been inpatients in a hospital or who have attended an accident and emergency department and because of the circumstances of their discharge and-or the urgency of the prescribed medication it would not be possible to attend their general practitioners to have the hospital prescription transcribed to a GMS prescription form.  This arrangement relieves any difficulties that patients might encounter who are due to be discharged from hospital late in the evening or at weekends.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">I believe that the Deputy is raising this matter, as he indicated, in the context of recent changes to the supply of medicines to some mental health patients in the area of the former Eastern Regional Health Authority.  In line with the Health Service Executive's stated policy to standardise and streamline arrangements under the State drug schemes, to improve equity for service users and increase efficiency, local services have been advised to direct medical card holders requiring psychiatric medicines to attend their local general practitioner.  This approach aligns the arrangements for the dispensing of drugs and medicines to persons on medication for a mental health condition, who reside in the greater Dublin area, with the arrangements that pertain in the case of persons living in all other parts of the country.  This is also consistent with the arrangements for dispensing drugs and medicines across the full spectrum of medical conditions and is consistent with the policy of normalising and de-stigmatising this aspect of our health care service.  It is also consistent with the key recommendations in A Vision For Change, the report of the expert group on mental health policy, pertaining to the treatment and care of mental health conditions in the primary care setting where it is acknowledged that treatment in this setting "enables the largest number of people to get easier and faster access to services".</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">This initiative ensures that general practitioners have a full involvement in their client's medications, including their psychiatric drugs.  The process also ensures that pharmacists, who continue to provide this medication to eligible persons under the various scheme arrangements, can claim reimbursement in respect of these drugs with their other monthly submissions.  These claims will be reimbursed by the HSE at the tariffs set by the Minister for Health under the applicable regulations.  This change will not disadvantage medical card holders and it will reduce the administration associated with these arrangements and free up resources for other patient services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">In summary, I assure the Deputy that it is best clinical practice that a person in need of treatment should regularly attend their GP and that the GP is fully aware of the medications that any patient may be being prescribed.  This is entirely consistent with the gatekeeper role played by the GP in the delivery of primary care.  Furthermore, due to the reimbursement arrangements under the GMS scheme whereby a GP is paid a capitation fee per eligible patient on their list, there are no additional costs associated with an eligible patient attending.  Rather, the rationalisation of previous local arrangements to fit with the national arrangements provides obvious administrative savings and increased efficiencies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1093">I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.  I am sure she will not mind me respectfully disagreeing with much of it.  I cannot accept that this is best practice when it is a practice that only applies to medical card holders.  If a private patient seeks psychiatric medical attention in the morning, he or she will get a prescription, go to the pharmacy, pay for the prescription and go home.  If patients with medical cards seek prescriptions, they attend their mental health specialists, for wont of a better phrase, and get their prescriptions, which are useless to them for accessing medication.  They must then attend their GP and endure the difficulty associated with getting appointments and waiting times in some areas.  It is only then they can go to their pharmacies.  All of this adds an additional layer of bureaucracy and inconvenience for medical card patients.  Were the process standardised across the board, the response would have some credibility but that does not seem to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">I welcome the fact that there is no extra cost but there is an extra inconvenience to patients.  I value the role of the GP and the answer made a great deal of sense in that respect.  We are all on the same page, in that we want to move to a situation in which mental health care is received in the community.  Ideally, the GP should be situated in the same building.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">This situation needs to be examined in light of the great technology that exists.  We saw how Revenue could have used it to good effect in respect of pensioners recently.  Computers should be able to talk to one another.  The areas in question, for example, autism, are often specialties and specialists would be the best people to monitor the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">It risks stigmatising those on the General Medical Services scheme with mental health difficulties.  There is an issue and I would appreciate it if the Minister of State relayed my comments to the Minister for Health.</p>

            <p eId="para_1101">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this Topical Issue for debate.  I do not want to waste too much time, but I am disappointed that the Minister or the relevant Minister of State at the Department of Health is not present.  One reason for turning Adjournment debates into Topical Issue debates under the heading of Dáil reform was to ensure the relevant Minister would take the debates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">When the Minister, Deputy Reilly, came to power, he arrived with great fanfare.  One of his first actions was to step down the old HSE board.  He is yet to appoint a new one.  As he stated himself, he has taken control of the reins and the buck stops with him.  Were he present, I would ask him whether he was satisfied with the fiasco that is the medical card situation.  I am not the only Deputy to raise this issue, as I am sure that Members on all sides of the House have experienced a high level of engagement with constituents in this regard.  Those constituents have been frustrated with the situation since the centralisation of the application process last July.  I could give example after example.  On Joe Duffy's phone-in radio show today, there was an hour and a half of examples of people experiencing extreme levels of frustration and anxiety.  They are sick and are only looking for their entitlements, yet they have been given excuse after excuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">I have been contacted by a lady who applied for a medical card last August.  She needed a serious operation and her card was due to expire at the end of August.  We telephoned at the end of the month and were told to telephone again in September.  When we did so we were told to telephone again at the end of the month.  The situation went on and on until, in December, the card was extended by one month to cover her operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">I have with me a letter to the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Services, PCRS, in Finglas dated 15 June 2011 regarding a medical card in the name of Mr. X.  The letter referred to the appeal received on behalf of Mr. X and, as he was within the limits for a medical card for a married couple, asked the PCRS to arrange to process the medical card at its earliest convenience.  Today is 26 January 2012 and the man is still awaiting his medical card.  He is lucky, as his doctor facilitates him when he has his weekly check-ups, but his pharmacist has understandably refused to accept him.  In another example, a single man with two children applied last September, submitted further information in October and is still awaiting a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The buck stops with the Minister for Health.  How does he intend to resolve this matter?  It is generating unnecessary anxiety among a large number of people.  On Joe Duffy's radio show today, the manager of a GP surgery spoke about the unbelievable number of forms that she must re-fill because she has been told the originals have been lost.  Deputies are told that we can only make two inquiries per call.  People are not allowed to submit more than one medical card application per envelope.  This is lunacy.  What will be done about it?  Deputies from all parties will submit parliamentary questions to beat the band to get answers on the position regarding people's medical cards.  This will cost more money than an efficient and effective service would.  Under the Croke Park agreement, if there are not enough people working in the service, additional staff could be redeployed to it to process medical cards within 15 days.  At present it is taking 15 weeks at a minimum.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1106">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is on official business in Northern Ireland and telephoned me to ask if I could take this debate for her.  I apologise on her behalf but she could not be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">This debate provides me with an opportunity to set out the steps being taken to address problems that have arisen in the processing of medical cards.  The final part of the centralisation project took place on 1 July with the centralisation of medical card processing and associated tasks for the entire country in the PCRS's office in Finglas, Dublin.  For the first time in the State's history, a single uniform system of application processing has been put in place.  It replaces the different systems previously operated through more than 100 offices across the country.  Some of the changes that have been introduced include the <i>www.medicalcard.ie</i> website and the standardisation of medical card assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">The new arrangements should ultimately provide for a far more accountable and better managed medical card processing system.  However, there have been difficulties.  These issues are a matter of concern and the Minister of State has held several meetings with the HSE to raise them.  She has been hands-on in addressing the matter.  As a result of those discussions, a number of changes are being introduced to the medical card application system to assist in accelerating the turnaround for applications by easing the level of pressure on the medical card system, particularly with respect to the review process, which has placed a large demand on the resources of the centralised office due to the timing of the re-issuing and, hence, review of a large cohort of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">In 2010, the central office introduced a self-assessment review process for people aged 70 years and over, as that cohort was managed entirely by the central office.  Following on from this development, from January on the HSE will ease the review process for all pensioners.  This change will mean that reviews for medical cardholders who are 66 years of age or older will operate on a self-assessment basis, as currently happens with those aged over 70 years.  The self-assessment review model will also be extended to medical cardholders under 66 years of age who were granted their medical cards on the basis of a means assessment and who the HSE is satisfied is living in this jurisdiction.  The HSE is also standardising eligibility periods from two years to three years for people aged under 66 years, with a new four-year eligibility period for medical cardholders aged 66 years or over.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Notwithstanding this, there continues to be an obligation on all cardholders to notify the HSE of any change in their circumstances that would no longer entitle them to hold a medical card.  The HSE is in the process of arranging access to data in the possession of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection to allow them to conduct reviews without troubling medical cardholders for further documentation.  It is also intended to increase the fine applying to false claims in a forthcoming Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">Discretionary cards, emergency cards and cards held by people in a small number of other categories will continue to be reviewed in the normal way but the HSE is confident that the extension of the self-assessment model to the great majority of medical cardholders will simplify the process substantially, improve the service to the client and continue to improve turnaround times for reviews.  It is hoped that ultimately 80% of renewals will be dealt with in this way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">The new process also focuses attention on active users of the medical card in order to ensure those most in need are captured within the streamlined process.  In addition, from 1 February, the HSE will implement a new system which gives GPs the additional ability to identify and assist the most vulnerable medical card holders.  GPs will be able to maintain the eligibility of these patients where they are going through the renewal system.  They will also be able to add newborns to the medical card system online.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">The Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall, wishes to emphasise that in no circumstances should a medical card holder who genuinely engages with a review have his or her entitlement withdrawn before that review is complete.  This is unacceptable.   Some such cases were brought to her attention in recent weeks.  The HSE is taking steps to ensure the rule is properly implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">In addition, the primary care reimbursement services's central office is working to deal with some of the processing issues that have arisen.  This has included reviewing and refining the systems for the receipt and logging of applications and documents sent in following requests for additional information.  In addition, the PCRS has received further staff resources this month as a result of a transfer from the Central Statistics Office.  This should make an impact on processing times.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall, will continue to monitor the situation and has arranged to meet the HSE on a regular basis to discuss any issues that may arise with respect to medical cards.</p>

            <from>Deputy Robert Troy</from>
            <p eId="para_1115">I thank the Minister of State for her reply which included some positive elements, particularly the four year eligibility period for medical card holders aged 66 years and over and the extension of the self-assessment process to include those above that age.  However, not everybody over 66 years should have to undertake an assessment.  Instead, assessments should be made at random, as is the case with the Revenue Commissioners in respect of tax returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">The Minister of State painted the new centralised processing facility in Finglas in a very positive light.  Unfortunately, that does not tally with the experience of service users.  If there is a need to redeploy more staff to the unit, it should be done.  As it is, it is neither efficient nor effective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">I welcome the Minister of State's undertaking that there will be no more cases of people losing their medical card before the review period is complete.  What concrete steps will be taken to ensure the 15-day turnaround time is achieved in all cases?  I know from my constituency office that most medical card applications are 100% complete when submitted, yet additional items of information are being requested before they are processed.  There is a certain view, not entirely unjustified, that these delays are part of a stalling strategy the purpose of which is to secure cost savings.  Will the Minister confirm that there is no cynical tactic on the part of the Government in this regard?  To employ such a tactic would be despicable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">This is an issue affecting the most vulnerable in society, including seriously ill persons who cannot afford to wait for their medical card to be granted or renewed.  I acknowledge that there are occasions when applications are submitted without all of the necessary information, in which cases one cannot expect an answer within 15 days.  However, in the case of fully completed application forms, the 15-day turnaround target should always be met.</p>

            <p eId="para_1119">We all acknowledge that the centralisation process which began some years ago has resulted in some problems in the processing of medical card applications.  The Minister of State, Deputy Róisín Shortall, regularly meets the HSE in an effort to iron out any the difficulties that arise.  As the Deputy acknowledged, there are proposals which will make it easier for people, including self-assessment and so on.  These are being implemented on a gradual basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">As I said, the reviewing and refining of the systems for the receipt and logging of applications and documents is ongoing.  As public representatives, we have all seen cases in which a person is adamant that he or she has submitted all the required documentation only to receive a request for more information.  That issue is being addressed, but I accept it is frustrating.  I will convey the Deputy's concerns to the Minister of State who is taking a hands-on approach to this issue.  I agree that as we are talking about very vulnerable people, we should ensure the information is available.  As I said, a person whose case is under review will continue to hold his or her card until the review is completed.  I recognise this is a cause of great worry.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection  (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1125">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Rent supplement provides short-term support for eligible persons living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011.  The number of persons claiming the allowance went from almost 60,200 in 2005 to more than 96,800 at the end of 2011, an increase of 61%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">As my Department funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector, it is essential that State supports for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others such as low-paid workers and students.  New maximum rent limits came into force on 1 January 2012 which are in line with the most up-to-date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer, while also ensuring persons in receipt of rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation.  It is expected that the new limits will achieve €22 million in savings this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">All new rent supplement applications are subject to these limits.  As existing claims come up for review, usually every six months, or when an existing lease expires, they will be reassessed using the new limits.  These reviews are being carried out by former community welfare officers who joined my Department on 1 October 2011 and are now departmental officials.  Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit, the customer is asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates, departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.  Departmental guidance to the officers administering rent supplement states that where negotiation with the landlord fails, the supplement may continue to be paid for a period of up to 13 weeks at the higher rate.  However, once the lease has expired, the tenant will be expected to find suitable accommodation at below the new limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">The provision of social housing is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  I am advised that his Department has agreed a target of delivering 2,000 units that have been identified by the National Asset Management Agency as potentially suitable for social housing use.  The provision of social housing is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.  I am advised that Department has agreed to the delivery of 2,000 units which have been identified by NAMA as potentially suitable for social housing use.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1130">It is important this scheme follows rather than leads the market.  There is a danger that the word will go out that the Department in subsidising 40% of the private rental market is subsidising landlords rather than tenants.  I accept that unlike in times past a small number of landlords, who are owners of a second home rather than part of large operations, are in financial distress.  That said, one cannot artificially inflate the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">As I understand it, the Minister is saying - which seems reasonable - that the new rates come into effect from the review date or date of expiry of a lease and that in the event of failure to reach agreement with a landlord a tenant can involve a community welfare officer, which officers were seconded to the Minister's Department on 1 January last year and became civil servants in October.</p>

            <p eId="para_1133">When Minister for Social Protection - the Minister may have found traces of this in the Department - I was working with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on standards in rented accommodation, PRTB pre-registration rather than post-registration, BER ratings, building regulations and so on.  Has the Minister progressed discussions on those issues?  The Department is spending €500 million on rented accommodation, which according to statistics includes some of the coldest accommodation in the country.  There is a need for joined up thinking in this regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_548" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1134">A similar rent review took place in 2009 when Deputy Ó Cuív was Minister.  The ultimate effect of that was an overall reduction in rents of approximately 4%, which effected significant savings.  It is important to note that there are people at work on low wages who rent and there are students who rent.  If the Department, as probably the single biggest individual player in this area, is a force in driving rents upwards landlords will gain and workers will suffer.  The same applies in respect of students.  It is important Deputies who are concerned note this point.  Similar reviews have had the consequence of reducing rents somewhat.  Also, reviews provide the Department with important information.  My Department spends €500 million on rent supplement, which is a huge amount.  It is important those who obtain maximum value from this are tenants whose rent is being assisted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">On Deputy Ó Cuív's question in regard to the PRTB and standards of accommodation, detailed discussions are ongoing between an in interdepartmental committee and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in relation ultimately to the latter Department taking responsibility for the administration of rental accommodation.  There are currently more than 36,000 people on the RAS scheme.  Progress in this regard has been relatively slow.  As regards the PRTB, that agency, in consultation with my Department, has created a software solution allowing it to isolate rent supplement tenancies which it considers should be registered with the PRTB but have not yet been registered by landlords.  This is supported by information on rent supplement tenancies supplied by my Department on a quarterly basis.</p>

            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_1136">Despite the Minister's statements, there is no evidence to suggest this measure will succeed in reducing rents.  This decision is made against the backdrop of many people in receipt of rent allowance already paying in excess of the €30 minimum they are required to pay.  They are forced into having to pay over the odds because many landlords will not accept people on rent allowance.  Vulnerable people will be the fall guys of what the Minister is doing.  I have received correspondence on this issue from many people, including from a heroic mother, Deirdre from Wicklow, who fought tooth and nail to have her disabled son educated in a local school and is now faced with having to move out of that area because her rent allowance limit has been reduced from €850 per month to €625 per month.  She will not be able to maintain that unit and is faced with having to either move out of the area or move into substandard accommodation.  Meanwhile nothing is being done to release the numerous empty units around the country, many of which are NAMA properties effectively owned by the State, thus ensuring people are not constantly forced to move to different geographic areas.</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_550" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1137">Deputy Daly stated that a particular woman in Wicklow is paying €850 per month in rent.  I do not know where in Wicklow the person lives and cannot, therefore, inform the Deputy of the rent allowance for that area.  The Deputy has stated that the woman's rent allowance has been capped at €625 per month.  I suggest she take up this matter with the relevant departmental officer.  Community welfare officers and staff in my Department are sympathetic and understanding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">It is all very fine for Deputy Daly to suggest I should not be trying to make savings in terms of rent but I want value for the taxpayer and the tenant.  Also, I am entitled to take into account the person in work who lives in rented accommodation and is paying that rent out of a small wage and the student or family paying rent when a student goes to college.  My Department, in terms of its responsibilities in the administration of a large budget, must ensure it does not distort the rental market by in effect permitting rents which are too high.  As I stated earlier, following a similar review by the previous Minister the outcome was a modest but important reduction in rents.  Lest the Deputy is not aware of it, rent levels in some areas are very high.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">Deputy Daly referred to NAMA.  As I stated earlier, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has agreed to take over 2,000 units deemed suitable for social housing.  Obviously, the units will have to be in appropriate areas.  Some of the surplus units may not be in areas where people in receipt of rent allowance wish to live.  If the woman to whom the Deputy referred wishes to write to me or to make contact with her local community welfare officer, I am sure she will be attended to diligently.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1142">Has consideration been given to making the penalties for doing so much more stringent, thus strengthening the law in this regard?  As for the interdepartmental committee, has the Minister discussed with her officials making a proposal to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the effect that registration of properties to let should be carried out before letting takes place?  This would be in contrast to the current situation, in which one lets the property and then registers with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, which is when the standards apply.  In this way, the Minister could be absolutely sure that all properties that were eligible for rent supplement would be up to standard because of the obligation to pre-register such properties.  I was driving that agenda when I was in the Department because it is a case of the horse being behind the cart at present and that should be reversed.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_554">
            <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
            <p eId="para_1143">The Minister should reflect on the fact that the victims of this measure will be the tenants.  I can state this because the situation has already arisen.  I note the Minister quoted back the example of the plight of the lady in Wexford.  Although she has been on all the housing websites and has contacted all the estate agents, landlords are not taking up the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, property arrangements because the limits that already exist are below the market rates at present.  The Minister's measure will force that person out of the area in which she has fought so long.  Were the Labour Party serious about making savings and taking landlords out of the net, a serious approach would be taken to the NAMA properties.  The provision of 2,000 such properties in the context of 100,000 people on the waiting list is nothing but scratching the surface and is far too inadequate.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_555" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1144">I refer to Deputy Ó Cuív's comments on top-ups, to which Deputy Clare Daly also referred earlier.  Essentially, top-ups involve false declarations of what is the rent.  Any top-ups such as those to which Deputy Daly referred should be reported to the Department because, in effect, they constitute an abuse of the tenant in which a social welfare income is being paid and a rent contribution then calculated that is proportionate to that income.  Consequently, if Deputy Daly has evidence with regard to top-ups, I suggest she should act responsibly and report those top-ups in order that landlords are not being encouraged to exploit tenants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">On the issue of further co-operation between the PRTB and the Department, Deputy Ó Cuív in particular should note it entails furthering the involvement of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Ultimately, it would be preferable to have much more widespread leasing arrangements for a longer time and negotiated at good rates.  This would offer a return to the landlord but more importantly would offer value to the taxpayer.  While this is what the Department is moving towards, Deputy Ó Cuív is aware that progress in this regard is slow because the local authorities have approximately 88 different differential rent schemes.  However, the interdepartmental committee is undertaking an amount of work on aligning different schemes throughout the country and I hope to be able to report further progress in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1148">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">Community employment, CE, is a valuable resource in the provision of a range of services to communities.  However, it is acknowledged that its effectiveness in terms of labour market progression is somewhat limited.  The report, Supports and Services for Unemployed Jobseekers: Challenges and Opportunities in a Time of Recession, published in August 2011 by the National Economic and Social Council, was critical in terms of labour market progression.  The report, What Can Active Labour Market Policies Do?, published by the ESRI in November 2011, also noted that previous studies had determined that CE was not associated with increased post-programme employment chances and that previous participation in a CE scheme was associated sometimes with an increased risk of long-term unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">The budget for CE for 2012 is approximately €315 million.  The massive increase in unemployment requires that as many places as possible are open to a broader range of jobseekers.  The reduction in training and employment grants was implemented in the context of the overarching need to ensure that all Exchequer expenditure is targeted appropriately, which I consider to be a reasonable objective.  Moreover, the total number of CE places available and the number of CE supervisors are not affected.  At present, there are approximately 1,400 CE supervisors and more than 22,000 CE places.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151">I have directed that a review of the financial resources of individual schemes be completed by the end of March.  The purpose of the review is to examine the income and funding of sponsoring organisations in terms of their ability to continue to deliver the programme.  As part of the review, alternative sources of support will be examined, particularly the level of funding from other State agencies.  The review also will seek to establish whether income is generated by scheme activity and the potential for utilisation of these funds to cover project costs.  The outcome of each review will provide a clear picture of the core funding required for each CE scheme.  This will assist my Department in ensuring a fair distribution of the funding available for these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">I have given assurances to community and voluntary organisations that no CE scheme will be forced to close as a result of the reductions in training and material grants, pending the completion of this review at the end of March.  This guarantee will be funded by my Department from its 2012 allocation.  In parallel, my Department is also undertaking a policy review of all employment support programmes under its aegis.  CE is being considered as part of this review and stakeholders will be consulted as part of this review process.  I expect to have this review in the first quarter of this year.  These reports at both the individual CE scheme level and at the macro level will provide good evidence on which to base future policy.  The outcome of the review will form part of the report to the troika.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153">I again assure the House of my full appreciation of the value of CE schemes locally.  The focus now is on achieving improved outcomes both in terms of service provided at local level and job progression for CE participants themselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_1154">Is the Minister aware the cut of 66%, on which she decided in respect of the CE training and materials grant, will decimate community employment schemes and projects as well as those communities which depend on such schemes?  I note the Minister has acknowledged this dependence on many schemes.  Does the Minister agree the cut actually was made earlier this month?  Notwithstanding her announcement of a review before Christmas that led many of those concerned to believe they had been saved from a cut, does she agree this is not the case?  Does the Minister accept she announced the review and misled the public and the CE schemes simply to get her own party's backbenchers off her case?</p>
            <p eId="para_1155">In the budget, she announced a cut to the community employment programme of €41.5 million and has determined to make a cut of approximately €27.5 million to the training and materials funding.  In essence, she already has decided the outcome of the review and the reply she has just given appears to endorse this suggestion.  Has she already decided the outcome of the review and its purpose?  Does the Minister agree she is conducting a review after the fact and by so doing, she is demonstrating she did not bother to assess the cut's impact when deciding to make it in the first instance?  Does she agree that had she sought it, most of the material to which she has referred already is in the possession of the Department and the review could have been carried out without implementing a cut of the scale announced?</p>

            <p eId="para_1156">There is no shortage of reviews of community employment, of which there have been a great many right up to the time when community employment schemes joined my Department.  They came under its aegis on 1 January, or in practice on 4 January, together with approximately 700 staff who previously had worked in the employment services side of FÁS and the administration of community employment schemes.  On foot of the community employment schemes coming under the aegis of the Department of Social Protection and given that Department's long commitment to people who are unemployed, I am convinced that when Members again discuss this issue in eight or nine months time, it will be evident how much progress has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to reviews.  All of the reviews, both national and international, have been highly critical of the lack of progression for people on CE schemes into employment.  It must be remembered that these schemes are described as labour market schemes.  Deputies are aware that CE schemes are critically important to many areas throughout the country in the context of the delivery of local services.  The first of the two reviews that are under way is considering matters revolving around the financial facts and figures relating to CE schemes.  It would be very odd if, on assuming responsibility for these schemes, the Department of Social Protection did not seek an analysis of the very large spend relating to them.  This year, we will be spending approximately €315 million on CE schemes.  In total, we will be spending over €1 billion in respect of employment support schemes, some of which originated with FÁS and others, such as the back to education allowance scheme, which have always been funded by my Department.  We are considering the position with regard to all of these schemes.  I am of the view that many Deputies would be extremely disappointed if we did not engage in an investigation of the funding relating to them.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_559">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1158">It was on my watch that the decision was made to move the CE schemes and the employment support schemes relating to FÁS within the Department's remit.  That was a good decision and, as a result of it, the Minister has been dealt a very good hand of cards because she has responsibility for the CE schemes, the community services programme and various other schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">In the context of training, those who are over 55 are allowed to remain on the schemes but I do not see the point in people engaging in training year after year.  This is one of the changes I considered when I was in office and it is the reason the Tús programme exists.  Basically, the line of progression was seen to be from CE schemes into Tús.  It is my opinion that a mistake was made when the money relating to materials was cut.  Introducing an across-the-board reduction in respect of training was also a mistake.  I put it to the Minister that there are other savings which could have been made.  Does she agree that considerable savings could be made by using the Tús model because this would mean there would be no need to have 400 separate companies paying fees to 400 sets of auditors or to have 400 individuals responsible for making up wages each week?  The 53 companies operating under the Tús programme have available to them all the support they require and the wages relating to all of them are made up in Clifden, County Galway, each week.  Perhaps the wages for the CE schemes could also be made up at this location?</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">Considerable savings could be made if the type of rational approach I am advocating were adopted.  There is always a great deal of discussion with regard to quangos.  Effectively, the CE schemes have given rise to the creation of 400 unnecessary quangos.  Would it be possible to make further significant savings if, as is the case with Tús, a single insurance policy applied in respect of the CE schemes?</p>

            <p eId="para_1161">Under the CE structure, there are over 1,000 voluntary companies which are run by voluntary boards.  The participation of the latter is really important.  The fact that these 1,000 companies are limited by guarantee gives rise to major costs.  I have seen some preliminary indications that in many areas the cost of an audit for some of these extremely small entities is between €1,800 and €2,000.  That is the amount being charged and these are not even full audits.  The insurance costs are also quite high.  These are two areas in respect of which savings can be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1164">As already intimated, there are substantial savings to be made.  During the period of the review - the other purpose of which is to collect data - I want to encourage the CE schemes to co-operate with the former regional and local management of FÁS who are now civil servants working for the Department of Social Protection and supply the data and information that is required.  A number of schemes have multiple sources of funding.  Some may be in receipt of funding from my Department and the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs and Health, while others may be sponsored by local authorities.  There is a need to obtain a reliable picture in respect of the different sources of funding.  Some CE schemes - I accept it is not a huge number - have significant income-earning abilities.  We want to target the funding at the schemes which are in most need of it.  I would appreciate the support of Deputies while the review is ongoing.  I urge them to encourage those who operate the schemes to remain in close communication with the officials who have been administering them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1165">The Minister referred to the reviews, which discovered that there was limited progression.  If the level of progression is so low, does she not accept that it is illogical to reduce the training and materials grants?  The training grant is particularly important because it is the only hope in the context of ensuring that people are trained.  Does she agree that there can be very little progression if there are no jobs?  Would the Minister not delay the budget cut pending the outcome of the reviews?  As she stated, many similar reviews are sitting on shelves.  If some of the recommendations they contain had been implemented or if some of the data already available within the Department had been used, those who operate the CE schemes would not be obliged to go cap in hand to the Department in order to obtain money to allow them to try to survive for the next couple of months.  That they are being obliged to approach the Department is going to create another bureaucratic nightmare for it.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1168">It was my intention, had I remained in office, that it would not be a one-year scheme.  The Department of Finance made a demand in that regard and as the Minister is aware, the Government of which I was a member was running out of time.  Tús is very streamlined in its operation and this means that money is freed up for the purpose of providing people with employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">Does the Minister agree that there are people who will never obtain employment in the open labour market?  People have a right to work and to make a contribution.  Does the Minister further agree that many services in this country would fall apart if CE schemes did not exist?  For some people, progression is not a realistic option.  Unlike Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I believe that after a certain time people who have been undergoing training and who are unlikely to emerge from the system want what they are doing to be classed as a job rather than as a training scheme.  If I had remained in office, it had been my intention - as is the case with the RSS, in respect of which time limits do not apply - that people who complete their involvement in community employment and who are unlikely to emerge from the system should move to the Tús programme and continue working on it until they obtain alternative employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">Does the Minister agree that it is heartbreaking for those who are unemployed to be thrown off FÁS schemes, having been on them for four or five years, and removed from the system?  Would it not be ideal if everybody who is unemployed had the option to remain on a work scheme on a continuous basis and as long as he or she is available for work when he or she finishes his or her training scheme?  Some of the great gurus in the system utter all sorts of nonsense with regard to people seeking work.  There are 450,000 people on the live register and we know they would start work tomorrow if they were offered the opportunity.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1171">There are three elements to the reviews.  The first relates to identifying the services that are being delivered to communities.  Like other Deputies, I recognise the importance of such services.  I will not describe those services in detail but I am referring, for example, to meals on wheels, etc., which are extremely important to people in both urban and rural areas.  The second element contemplated by the reviews relates to progression.  There may be an issue in the context of the description of the schemes, which implies that they will lead directly to employment.  As a result of this, our interlocutors from the troika want to examine the position with regard to progression.  In respect of certain schemes, opportunities for progression can be limited.  The third element is value for money.  As stated earlier, there are up to 1,000 voluntary companies and this is a factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">Deputy Ó Cuív referred to Tús.  When I became Minister in March, although the Tús scheme was provided for, there was nobody on it.  I spent a lot of time in May and June getting the scheme off the ground.  As Deputy Ó Cuív says, the companies that got involved have been very productive.  At the end of December, there were around 2,300 people on  Tús and over 4,000 people on JobBridge.  We have had almost an extra 7,000 opportunities, with more on offer, between those two schemes.  It is critical that in the review of the CE, we get more opportunities for more people to have an option.  That could be education, training, work on a CE scheme or work with JobBridge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, the unemployment situation is extremely difficult.  So many people want an opportunity. There are many men in their 20s to their 50s who are now coming into long-term unemployment, and huge numbers of them want an opportunity to participate in the scheme.  It behoves me as a Minister to create opportunities for people like that who have not so far had an opportunity, and I am determined to do that.</p>

            <p eId="para_1174">3<b>Deputy Joan Collins</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> her views on the continuous delay in processing applications for social welfare benefits and allowances and in particular the average of six months for processing applicants for carer’s allowance and benefit. [4749/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_568" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1175">The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria.  At the end of 2011, there were almost 52,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance from my Department at a total cost of almost €500 million.  Approximately 22,000 of these were getting half-rate carer's allowance in addition to another social welfare payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">The average time taken to award a carer's allowance application was 17 weeks in the third quarter to the end of September 2011, and not the six months quoted in this question.  Due to the introduction of a new claims processing system for carer's allowance, figures for the last quarter of 2011 are unavailable as new claims are being processed on the new system while older claims are still being processed on the old system.  For carer's benefit, the average time to award a claim in 2011 was ten weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">In order to meet the challenge of increased volumes of new claims for its schemes, the Department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation, including the development and roll-out of new computer systems in the invalidity pension, carer's allowance and disability allowance areas.  This roll-out of new systems is a very resource intensive task and consequently has had a negative impact on the claims processing performance for carer's allowance where the project is currently underway.  Once the programme of roll-outs is fully completed, I expect that performance will recover and improve.  In the meantime the Department is taking all steps available to augment resources in order to process claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1178">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">For example, since May 2008, 900 staff have been assigned to my Department, mainly through the transfer and redeployment of staff from other Departments.  In addition, the Department has recruited new medical assessors and appointed additional staff to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">In order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to customers, the Department is also undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service.  The establishment of the NEES under the management of my Department brings together the community welfare service, the employment services and community employment programmes of FÁS, the rural social scheme and community services programme from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the redundancy and insolvency schemes from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">It is my intention that the NEES will integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit.  This new service will provide a coherent integrated and more personalised service to customers and will help minimise the duplication that characterised services which were provided separately in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_1182">I hear what the Minister is saying, but our experience in dealing with these claims is as outlined in the question.  We are dealing with cases going back to July 2011 for the carer's allowance. It is not good enough that people have wait around that long to get clarification on whether they are entitled to the allowance or not.  People have to get credit union loans to keep themselves going, while waiting for the approval or non-approval of the allowance to come through.  It is the same for invalidity pensions.  A person goes through an application for an invalidity pension and is refused.  The review then takes 12 weeks and if that does not succeed there is then a six month wait for an appeal.  That totals nearly 18 months for somebody waiting to find out whether or not he or she is entitled to an invalidity pension.  That is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">When will this roll-out happen?  The current situation cannot continue and something has to be done.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1184">The Department's document record and information management programme is being rolled out, in tandem with what is called service delivery modernisation.  That has been underway for a number of different claims.  The scanning of medical documents in the social welfare services office in Longford started in November 2010.  At the beginning of September 2011, scanning was extended to include carer's allowance application forms and associated documentation.  This is part of a very large modernisation process and is ongoing at the moment.  We hope to have large elements of it fully completed in a relatively short period of time.  We have allocated extra resources.  After I became Minister, I appointed extra appeal officers.  Extra work has also been provided for.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">The Deputy must understand that the volume of applications has risen very significantly.  This scheme has grown very dramatically in terms of the number of applications that have been received, both for the carer's allowance and for the half-rate carer's allowance.  We are trying to improve the systems to provide a better service.</p>

It is imperative that these are put into place as quickly as possible.  Is the Government continuing with the clientelism that we all hated with the last Government, where people had to go to Deputies who had a hotline to get through to a particular area?  This Government has promised to move away from the failed politics we have had in recent years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1195">Domiciliary care allowance is paid to more than 24,000 parents and guardians in respect of 26,000 children at a cost of approximately €100 million in 2011, with the accompanying respite care grant costing a further €45 million.  In addition, the Department makes an extensive range of payments to support families with children.  In 2011, approximately €2 billion was paid out in respect of 1.36 million children on child benefit.  In addition, qualified child increases were also paid to people on social welfare payments in respect of 495,000 children, with 369,000 at full rate and 126,000 at half rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1196">Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment to the parent or guardian of a child with a disability so severe that the child requires care and attention and-or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be provided to allow the child to deal with the activities of daily living and the child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1197">Domiciliary care allowance cases are reviewed to ensure the conditions for receipt of the payment continue to be met.  Cases are reviewed based on either a scheduled review based on the recommendation of the medical assessor when the claim is initially processed, or on the basis of information received about a change of circumstances which potentially affects the continued entitlement of a case already in payment.  As with the carer's allowance, this is a medically based assessment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">Scheduled reviews, on the recommendation of one of the medical assessors, are based on the prognosis of the child's disability and how his or her condition may improve over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">The review interval will vary from 12 months in cases where the child's disability is likely to improve significantly in the short term, to a five or ten year review date if the child's condition is likely to remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.  In circumstances where a child has a life-long disability that is unlikely to improve by any significant degree, a "do not review again" status may be used.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">It is not accurate to say that parental or medical evidence is not sought or taken into account in the review process.  Domiciliary care allowance reviews are initiated with the completion a review of medical criteria form by the parent, which also requires medical input from the child's doctor.  The parent returns this form, together with any additional recent reports of medical or therapeutic services the child may be receiving.  This information is then sent for review by one of the Department's medical assessors who will provide an opinion to the deciding officer on whether the child still meets the medical criteria for receipt of the payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">The decision of the deciding officer is communicated to the customer in writing and they are given the option to appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office within 21 days.  The average processing time for an appeal dealt with on a summary basis is just under six months for appeals and just over a year for appeals where an oral hearing is requested.</p>

            <p eId="para_1203">I thank the Minister for her reply.  The reason I tabled this question is a number of my constituents have had their cases reviewed even though their circumstances have not changed.  In one case a child with Down's syndrome - circumstances which unfortunately are not going to change - had been assessed two years previously and payment was going to be reduced from 31 January.  An appeal process would have taken 14 months.  My point is that no review process exists between an application being turned down and an appeal process and potentially there could be a wait of 14 months for payment although the circumstances would not have changed.  This seems very unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">A number of cases have come to light in recent weeks and a review process should be put in place for circumstances which will not change.  I agree with reviewing cases where circumstances can change and improve but payments for children assessed two years previously whose circumstances will not change for a considerable period of time or perhaps never should not be cut.</p>

            <p eId="para_1205">This scheme came to the Department from HSE and the Department of Health in 2009 and its payment and structures need to be reviewed.  As stated about carers, it is also subject to modernisation in terms of processing.  Review dates are most often set by the medical reviewer suggesting a child may be looked at again after a particular interval.  I am happy to speak to the chief medical officer in the Department.  Again there are variations whereby some children have a condition which is likely to be life-long and in other cases - it is hoped - children make a full recovery or make such progress that a domiciliary care allowance may no longer be appropriate.  As we improve the processing of claims we can then turn our attention to this area.</p>

These cases are dismissed without medical evidence, after which new medical evidence is submitted.  They are dismissed with the stroke of a pen or the push of a computer button.  People want an opportunity to produce medical evidence in a review rather than having to wait a long period of time.</p>

There is a sense that a consultant's letter rather than a GP's letter is all that is accepted.  This is an insult to GPs and I would not say their representative bodies are too happy.  Will the Minister confirm whether this is the case?  Another aspect is the long waiting lists to see consultants, after which is a waiting list for the typing pool and yet another waiting list when the application is made.  An undue amount of time is spent waiting.</p>

I get the impression that sometimes the medical people providing certification have not read the terms of the scheme.  They state a condition exists but they do not read the terms of the scheme which require information on a level of support.  Is this a problem?  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure medical practitioners are made more aware of the terms of the scheme prior to providing certification?</p>

            <p eId="para_1209">One of the reasons for the refusal of an application which is subsequently awarded is the required medical evidence is not presented in the required format.  The medical people in the Department have much contact with various medical organisations with a view to improving communication.  As the various schemes we have been speaking about today are modernised and the new technology is settled down, we should examine being very clear to the applicants and their medical advisers on the minimum acceptable standard.  If an application does not meet this standard at the initial stage before refusal is offered, as happens with regard to other applications, people are advised the application is incomplete and asked to complete it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1210">7<b>Deputy Seán Crowe</b> asked the <b>Minister for Social Protection</b> the estimated number of families that will be impacted by the budget cut reducing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance from €305 to €250 for children aged 12 years or more and from €200 to €150 for children aged four years to 11 years; if her attention has been drawn to research published by Bernardos demonstrating that the 2011 allowance levels fell far short of the actual costs; and if she will reverse this cut. [4354/12]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_584" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1211">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the cost of uniforms and footwear for children going to school.  The survey to which the Deputy refers is a survey of the cost of sending a child to school which is not directly comparable.  In 2011, more than 196,000 individuals received a back to school clothing and footwear allowance payment in respect of 384,000 children at a cost of almost €91 million.  A means test is applied to the scheme to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need ensuring maximum value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1212">As a budgetary measure, the allowance payable was reduced from €305 to €250 for children aged from 12 to 22 and from €200 to €150 for children aged from four to 11 years for the 2012 scheme.  No payment is being made with regard to children aged two or three years because they do not go to school.  Despite these reductions, the current payment rates still show significant increases since 2006 and compare favourably when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends over the same period.  It is estimated that in 2012 some 340,000 children will benefit from the scheme at these lower rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">According to the consumer price index for November 2011, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 27.2% since December 2006.  Since 2006, payment rates for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme have increased by 87% for those under 11 years of age and by 31% for those over 11 years of age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  I am satisfied the changes to the scheme in recent years, in particular the scheme improvements relative to the consumer price index trends, are still providing a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with returning to school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">Although there has been a decrease in the rates of payment for this year, by maintaining the same income limits, which have increased significantly in recent years, I have ensured the back to school clothing and footwear allowance payment is targeted at those most in need of assistance.</p>

            <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_1216">The Minister stated this was an important payment in times of financial strain yet her decision in the budget was to cut it.  This is a significant cutback as already many families experience a great deal of debt when their children are returning to school.  The increase in recent years was to take account of the increase in the cost of getting children to school, and those costs have not dropped.</p>
            <p eId="para_1217">The Minister stated she was aware of the Barnardos school costs survey.  Barnardos' main spokesperson, Fergus Finlay, a member of the Minister's party, has highlighted regularly the financial stress parents are under and this reduction in the back to school allowance will exacerbate that stress.  Does the Minister agree with Barnardos that as a result of this cut more families will go into debt this September?  Does she agree also that her cuts, including the cut in the back to school allowance, will deepen child poverty for the remainder of this year and into the future?  Will she reinstate this payment to the 2011 level in recognition of the increase in day to day costs?</p>

            <p eId="para_1218">The country is in a major financial emergency and I was required to find extensive savings in terms of the social protection budget, which I did, but I also ensured that the core rates remained intact which I believed was very important.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">Regarding this scheme, the allowance that will be available this year is significant in terms of the needs of a primary or secondary school child.  We are now paying it to a very large number of children, 340,000, and we expect to pay it to that number of children this year.  The reality is that the cost of clothing in particular has fallen significantly relative to the increases in the payments which were made, particularly in times when there were significant amounts of money to spend.  The spending by the Department this year on the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will offer significant assistance to families, particularly families on a social welfare income.  The Deputy should bear in mind that families are in receipt of child benefit and if they are on a social welfare income they would be in receipt of qualified child increases also.  The support given to children by us in our budgetary process is very significant.</p>

            <p eId="para_1220">Does the Minister believe the cut will result in a drop in the school completion rates?  This measure may discourage some children, particularly those in secondary schools, returning to school or discourage their parents allowing their children return to school.  The fact that the Minister is paying this allowance to more people is a reflection of the crisis we are in and our unemployment levels because it is a means tested payment and is not as easy to obtain as other payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1221">The Minister might indicate where she got the information that school clothing costs have decreased.  To my knowledge they have not dropped in the areas I represent when I shop for school clothing for my own children, and those are not the only costs associated with going to school.  While this is a clothing and footwear scheme it often goes beyond that in subsidising books and bus fares.</p>

            <p eId="para_1222">In regard to books, it is more than high time that primary schools in particular but secondary schools also had book rental schemes.  A very large number of schools have book rental schemes for a modest contribution by parents and significant contributions by the Department of Education and Skills in the case of children who are disadvantaged.</p>

            <p eId="para_1224">Enormous savings can be effected in that regard but also a huge reduction in the level of concern and stress parents face when their children return to school.  I hope I will see the day when every school will have a good quality book rental scheme as is the case in many schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">Regarding school uniform costs, like the Deputy I have occasion to be involved on behalf of family members in shopping for school uniforms and checking prices.  All of the very large department and chain stores give extraordinarily high quality value for money in school clothes.  I understand some schools may have more expensive requirements such as crests but if a jumper must have a crest its cost can increase by €25.  While we are in this financial emergency a profound argument can be made for schools allowing parents to choose the cheaper chain store options, which are nicely made and very good value for money.  That will be a matter for individual school communities and school boards but we could save parents a great deal of stress if we emphasised access to value for money options regarding the annual return to school.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1229">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1230">In November 2010 the then Fianna Fail-Green Party Government negotiated an agreement with the European Union-ECB-IMF funding troika which included undertakings regarding the social protection area, each with a specific timeframe for delivery.  That Government agreed a structural adjustment programme which we are now working through and which I stress is subject to a weekly, monthly and quarterly reporting process as well as ongoing discussions on all expenditure headings, including social protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1231">The progress made on current commitments is discussed with the troika delegation when it visits Dublin for each quarterly review, the achievement of commitments is noted where relevant, and the agreement is revised to reflect any new or follow-on commitments made in the course of the quarterly review, as appropriate.  All of the commitments in the social protection area that were required to be delivered up to the present time have been delivered in full and on time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">Spending on social protection in 2012 is expected to account for almost 40% of current Government expenditure.  The EU, the ECB and the IMF recognise the scale of spending on social protection and have emphasised the importance of reform in this area both as a contribution to fiscal consolidation and to facilitate economic recovery.  The troika has not identified any specific programmes that should be curtailed or discontinued but rather expressed overall targets to be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">However, as Deputies will be aware, the Government announced expenditure ceilings for all Departments for 2013 and 2014 when budget 2012 was brought before the Dáil last month.  These provide for savings of just over €1 billion in total by the end of 2014 in the social protection area above the savings from measures introduced in budget 2012 and previously.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">In that context, the Government has agreed with the troika that by the end of March the Department will draw up a comprehensive programme of reforms that can help better targeting of social support to those on lower incomes, and ensure that work pays for welfare recipients.  The Government has also agreed that it will take steps to strengthen activation and training policies to help jobseekers get back to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">The work done to date in respect of both of these commitments builds on policy documents published in 2010 in the areas of pensions, child income supports, payments to people of working age and payments to people with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">It is not intended that the reform programme would be finalised by end of March.  My intention is to bring reform proposals to Government initially and then to the Oireachtas in advance of finalisation, with implementation to commence in budget 2013.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_1237">Will the Minister accept that we need reform of the schemes on an ongoing basis?  Many of the reforms mentioned in the EU-IMF memorandum of understanding were already in train and under discussion in the Department, particularly the rationalisation of the child payments, disability payments and so on.  Does she intend to proceed with the part capacity provision introduced in the budget that would allow persons on invalidity pension to work and receive a partial payment, depending on the level of disability, the objective of which would be to facilitate those with a disability to remain in the workplace on a long term basis?  Is the Minister confirming today that the changes to community employment schemes, one parent family payment, child benefit and so on in the budget were not dictated by the EU-IMF and were decisions of the Government rather than the censure of the IMF?</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1238">In the language of high diplomacy, Deputy Ó Cuív was the Minister in the Department and a member of the Government that negotiated the deal with the troika.  The format of structural adjustment programmes around the world - we are not the first country to be in such a programme - is that there is enormous discussion between the people in the IMF, which is overseeing and supervising the programme and providing the loans, and the officials in the country which is in the programme.  Clearly, that is what happened when the IMF came to Dublin in November 2010, though if the Deputy recalls there were some denials from some members of that Government that such a process was under way.  We are in a framework.  The framework that was signed up to by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party includes very detailed, weekly, monthly and quarterly reporting and discussion at all appropriate intervals of what progress is being achieved.  The objective of the Government is to see the country exit successfully from the adjustment programme and return to economic growth.  We must have regard to the programme.  The troika members are exercised by issues such as activation, the cost overall of social protection and by various elements of various schemes.  In the language of structural adjustment programmes they take an interest in all of these issues and, as we have heard from time to time, different parts of the troika have different views on different issues.  I do not think the troika would describe itself as dictating to any particular Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1240">Will the Minister confirm that the agreement to date does not commit us to delivery or introduction of a single working age payments scheme <i>per se</i>  but to reform of the social welfare system and more efficiency?  Does she agree that prior to moving to such widescale reform such reform should be predicated by a roll-out of activation measures of training and educational opportunities and, in particular - the elephant in the room - jobs being available.  If only one part is rolled out the only people who will suffer are those who are dependent on social welfare.  Has the Minster contacted the Department of Education and Skills, which would be involved in some of the activation and educational opportunities, and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation?  Will the presentation to the troika in March-April be a combined one or will the Department of Social Protection make its presentation first?</p>

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_597" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1241">I will take the last question first.  The working method is to have both.  Nine Departments have conversations and discussions with the troika on a continuing basis and when they come to do their reviews in Dublin, just as they report on a continuing basis.  The co-ordinating Departments for dealing with the troika are the two finance Departments which oversee the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">On the single working age payment and roll-out of activation opportunities, I agree with the Deputy that there are commitments in regard to both in respect of the end of the first quarter of 2012, which were signalled when the original structure of the adjustment programme was put in place.  We will meet that deadline.  Obviously, the most important one is that in the context of the €1 billion, to which I referred earlier, being spent on various employment supports ranging from the two scheme to CE schemes to back to education allowances, it is important to give as many people who are unemployed as much opportunity as possible to take part in appropriate options, opportunities and training and that they are spread as widely as possible among those who are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">In regard to the activation programme, next week I will launch with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Department of Education and Skills a programme on the options, opportunities and structures of helping people to engage with the system in terms of getting back to work, back to education and back to training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about jobs.  The jobs initiative, launched by the Government in May 2011, has produced good and significant responses from employers particularly in the area of tourism from various parts of the country, including the west.  I am pleased that JobBridge, the national internship scheme that I launched in July 2011, has had a huge take up from employers.  It is interesting that there is a significant demand from people who were not originally in the JobBridge process, such as lone parents and people with a disability, to take part in it.  We are looking at that issue.  A huge volume of people on the live register on job seekers' allowance are very interested in engaging in opportunities and we must ensure that actually happens.  The troika constantly asks questions about this area.</p>

          the steps she will take to tackle the issue of the black economy, particularly those claiming social welfare payments while carrying out jobs without paying tax.

            <p eId="para_1248">The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department which processes in excess of 2 million claims each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week.  Social Welfare fraud is not a victimless crime. However, it is important to recognise that the vast majority of people are receiving the entitlement due to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">In September 2011, I published my Department's new Fraud Initiative (2011-2013).  Central to this initiative is a commitment to ensure a concerted and active policing of the hidden (or black) economy sector where there is a prevalence of social welfare fraud and tax non-compliance. Policing what is conventionally viewed as hidden economy activity is as much about ensuring a level playing field for compliant businesses and taxpayers as it is about combating social welfare fraud. A range of specific activities are being undertaken in the context of this plan including those outlined below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">In conjunction with other agencies and in particular with Revenue, the Department tackles the shadow economy by a combination of intelligence collation, assurance checks, data sharing and outdoor operations including inspections and direct investigations. My Department liaises bilaterally with Revenue through the High Level Group. One of the priorities of the group is to ensure ongoing collaboration and interaction between the organisations, including activities designed to combat social welfare fraud and tax non-compliance.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1254">As part of Budget 2012, the Government has decided that income from employment as a home help funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE) is to be assessed in means tests for social assistance schemes, in the same way as income from any other type of employment income.   Up to the end of 2011 a home help employed by the HSE could earn up to approximately €29,000 per annum and still qualify for a full social welfare payment as none of this income was taken into account when calculating their means. This exemption had initially been introduced to encourage people to take up employment as a home help at a time when such employment was very low paid. This is no longer the case as the status and salary levels have been formalised since 2000. As the salary scale is now well ahead of the national minimum wage, there is no longer a basis for this special exemption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">I recognise that income from home help hours can be insecure and sporadic in many cases. People working as home helps will, of course, benefit from the standard earnings disregards in line with all other employees and if their home help income is low, the measure announced in the Budget has little or no impact on them:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1256">One-Parent Family Payment: first €130 disregarded in full, amounts between €130 and €425 assessed at 50%</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1257">Jobseeker's Allowance: up to €60 per week disregarded in full and just 60% of the balance is assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">Similarly, a person on Jobseeker's Allowance whose partner is working as a home help, or a person working part-time as a home help and claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in respect of part of the week, will benefit from the standard Jobseeker's Allowance income disregards. In these cases, up to €60 per week is disregarded and just 60% of the balance is assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Up to now, no account was taken of home help income when assessing means for certain social welfare payments. This measure will reduce the payments of approximately 2,000 recipients whose means assessments had previously excluded all of their earned income from home help.  It advances the objective of treating all income in the same way for means testing purposes with no special arrangements depending on the type of employment. Given that background, I do not propose to withdraw the measure.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 29 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">As part of Budget 2012, the Government decided that income from Carer's Allowance and Carer's Benefit is to be assessed in the means test for Family Income Supplement, from January 2012 for new applicants and upon renewal for existing claimants.  The measure will be implemented over three years, with one third of the income from carer's allowance and carer's benefit payments assessed in 2012, two thirds in 2013 and full assessment in 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">Up to now, entitlement to FIS had been based on the level of a family's income including net income from employment and the value of any social welfare payments they might have, with the exception of carer's allowance and carer's benefit. For example, in the case of a lone parent in receipt of One-Parent Family Payment, the FIS means test has always taken full account of the value of the One-Parent Family Payment and treats it in the same way as income from employment.  This measure will bring the treatment of Carer's Allowance and Carer's Benefit into line with the treatment of other social welfare payments in the FIS means test.  The reform reduces a person's secondary payment, FIS, without affecting their primary payment, therefore targeting available scarce resources at those in most need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">The savings in 2012 from this measure will be less than €1m. and the number of recipients affected is approximately 500. The extent of the loss in any individual case depends on a number of factors, including the level of employment income which of course varies considerably from case to case. While the measure will affect a relatively small number of people, I recognise that this will mean a significant reduction in the level of FIS payable in some instances.  However, the people concerned will still receive a higher level of FIS in 2012 and again in 2013 than people with the exact same level of other income where that other income includes a social welfare payment other than Carer's Allowance or Carer's Benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">Deputies will appreciate that it gives me no satisfaction to cut the level of payment to any household. However, given the scale of the fiscal crisis the Government inherited and given that spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, savings have to be found in the social welfare system. The Government has endeavoured insofar as it could to limit cuts in social welfare to households where there is some additional income over and above the basic social welfare payment. In this case, the measure will bring in a modest level of savings while at the same time bringing more equitable treatment of all income for social welfare purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1269">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 21 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1270">Two measures will be considered by the Advisory Group: increasing the minimum age for new claimants from 16 to 18 years of age with a corresponding extension in the age of entitlement for domiciliary care allowance from 16 to 18 years of age, and introducing lower age-related payments for new disability allowance claimants aged from 18 to 24 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">The review of the disability allowance scheme, published in November 2010, recommended increasing the qualifying age to 18 years.  The review noted that the payment of disability allowance at age 16 carries with it the risk of creating a dependency on social welfare from a very young age.  Similarly, the purpose of the proposal to align disability allowance rates for new claimants aged 18-24 with jobseeker allowance rates was to discourage the development of welfare dependence at an early age and to avoid the creation of disincentives to young people to taking up opportunities for education, training and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">I am conscious that these measures gave rise to concerns about the impact on families of people with disabilities, most notably in the case of families of children and young adults with profound disabilities and these very real concerns will be considered by the independent Advisory Group.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed by September 2012 and, at that stage, together with my Government colleagues, I will reflect carefully on the findings of the Advisory Group. Other schemes are not affected by the withdrawal of the budget proposals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1274">Child benefit assists parents with the cost of raising children and it contributes towards alleviating child poverty. The estimated expenditure on child benefit for 2012 is just under €2 billion in respect of some 1.16 million children.  The Government recognises that welfare expenditure plays a vital role in protecting the most vulnerable people in Irish society, as well as stabilising the economy at both a national and at a local level. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to exempt income support to families from the general budgetary strategy, given the level of adjustments required. The budgetary measures that directly affect child-related payments are designed to ensure that payments genuinely address the needs of families and balance the need to ensure some support for all families with greater additional support for families on low income.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">The standardisation of child benefit rates over the next two years is an important component of introducing a more appropriate system of child income supports. While it is recognised that this measure will have implications for some families, the payments that provide additional support to families on low incomes, such as child-related increases on other social welfare payments and the family income supplement, remain unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">While my Department conducts extensive analysis of the impacts of budgetary decisions in determining child benefit payment rates, the issue of effects on the local economy is not specifically taken into account as the scheme is national. The Department did undertake analysis using the ESRI developed SWITCH model, which was used to determine the likely impact on poverty outcomes.  The financial impact of the change on various family types was also examined. Furthermore, a progress report on the issue of family and child income supports, which was received from the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, was also considered in the budgetary process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">The Advisory Group was established in June 2011 to consider a number of specific issues relating to the tax and social protection systems and to make cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. The Group is prioritising the issue of family and child income supports and I hope to revisit the broader structural reform agenda when I receive the Group's report on this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1281">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 28 and 38 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">Rent supplement provides short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Since 2005, rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011. The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 as at end 2011, a 61% increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The focus of the rent limits review was to ensure that in the region of 40% of suitable private rented housing accommodation within each county or administrative area will be available to rent supplement tenants. Departmental staff administering rent supplement have the authority to set levels lower than those provided for in the regulations, in respect of sub-divisions of their functional areas, where this is appropriate. This allows for lower rent levels to apply in certain locations within counties reflecting local market conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">The new limits are in line with the most up to date market data available. The Department used publicly available data sources to ascertain both the market trends and the current asking prices for one, two and three bedroom properties throughout Ireland on a county by county basis.  The Department also used data provided by the Private Residential Tenancies Board in respect of tenancies registered.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that value for money is achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for private rented accommodation. It is expected that the new limits will achieve €22m in savings this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">The new maximum rent limits will not change the after accommodation costs income of persons receiving rent supplement. Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources. The impact of the change in the rent limits will be on the rents received and expected by landlords.</p>

            <p eId="para_1287">The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide support for people with families who are on low earnings.  This preserves the incentive for them to remain in employment in circumstances where they might only be marginally better off than if they were claiming other social welfare payments.  The payment amount is based on a fixed proportion of the gap between the assessable income of the household (net of income taxes, PRSI Pension contribution and universal social charge) and prescribed FIS income thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">Currently this fixed proportion is 60 per cent of the difference between the weekly income and the income threshold for the family size. As these thresholds are linked with the number of dependent children in a household, FIS provides an important policy instrument in reducing child poverty in working households as well as improving incentives to work. Total expenditure on FIS was some €204 million in 2011. At the end of December 2011 there were approximately 28,876 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment of which 2,976(10%) were recorded as public servants.  That number includes those working in the civil service and the wider public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The pension levy was introduced in March 2009; public service pay reductions were effective from January 2010 and the universal social charge (USC) was introduced with effect from January 2011.  Both the pension levy and the USC are allowable as a deduction from gross earnings for the purposes of assessment of FIS.  Figures for the recorded number of civil and public servants in receipt of FIS at each year end during the periods are given in Table 1. This group has remained at about 10%-11% of the total number of FIS recipients.</p>

            <p eId="para_1313">My Department pays fees to medical certifiers, who are mainly general practitioners, for the completion and issue of medical certificates for illness benefit and the completion of medical reports for various social welfare schemes.  The fees are paid for the provision of medical opinion which is furnished on an official certificate or report form. Fees of €8.25 are paid per standard certificate and €44.44 for a more detailed medical report. These fees are paid in addition to whatever fees are charged by doctors for the clinical examination and treatment of patients.  However doctors should not charge these patients an additional fee for the issue of a certificate/report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">In 2011 my Department issued payments to 2,915 medical certifiers in respect of some 3.4 million certificates and 77,000 medical reports. The total cost amounted to €31.7 million. My Department does not pay dentists or opticians for certificates. Dentists and opticians are paid under the treatment benefit scheme for dental and optical services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">In line with the announcement in Budget 2012 that the costs of funding medical fees is to be reduced by 10%, the Department is finalising its proposals in this regard, which will then be communicated to the doctors on the Department's panel of medical certifiers.  The changes will not be the subject of negotiation with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) as the Competition Authority has advised that it would be contrary to competition law to negotiate with representative bodies such as the IMO on the setting of fees for services provided by medical certifiers.  However, as a matter of courtesy the Department will notify the IMO of any fee changes to be implemented in due course.  The Department is reviewing its certification processes generally to establish if further savings can be effected.</p>

The aim is to break the cycle of unemployment and to improve a person's opportunities and readiness to return to the labour market.  I consider the 12-month period on Tús to be adequate to meet the objectives of the initiative.  Additionally, the rotation of work placements will ensure that as many unemployed people as possible are able to benefit from these short-term work opportunities.  Tús is on course to engage 5,000 people when fully operational by late Spring.  As with all programmes and initiatives, I propose to keep the operation of Tús under review to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the initiative, including an evaluation of outcomes and learning opportunities.  This review will allow for changes to be made to the initiative where these are considered necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1321">It is a requirement under the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion that Government Departments, local authorities and state agencies assess policies and programmes at design, implementation and review stages for their likely impact on poverty and on inequalities likely to lead to poverty, with a view to poverty reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">As part of the deliberative process for Budget 2012, my Department analysed, in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes, including the changes to the Fuel Allowance, prior to the finalisation of the Budget. Due to the requirements of the budgetary process, it is not possible to publish this material in advance of the Budget and the associated Dáil votes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">Deputies will appreciate that it gives me no satisfaction to cut Fuel Allowance or any other payment. However, given the scale of the fiscal crisis and because spending on social protection accounts for nearly 40% of current Government expenditure, savings have to be found in the social welfare system. In the welfare package presented in Budget 2012, I sought to minimise the impact of the necessary adjustments in my Department's welfare expenditure on groups vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion. The Government has endeavoured insofar as it could to limit cuts in social welfare to households where there is some additional income over and above the basic social welfare payment and in that regard, avoided any general reduction in primary weekly welfare payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">My Department has prepared an analysis of the distributive and poverty impacts on families of the Budget 2012 tax and welfare package, in conjunction with the Department of Finance. This analysis is currently being finalised and will shortly be considered by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. I will arrange for the analysis to be published on the Department's website in March 2012, in line with the arrangements I put in place last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1326">The social welfare system is primarily a contingency-based system, with entitlement based on defined contingencies, such as sickness, unemployment, old age and widowhood. While it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time — for example, an unemployed person may become sick — a general principle applies whereby even if a person experiences more than one of the contingencies at any one time, he or she only receives one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1327">Existing legislation provided that regulations may be made to enable more than one of the payments to be paid concurrently and, where applied, it is usually in the context of short-term benefits. The Social Welfare Act 2011 provides for the discontinuation of the payment of half-rate jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit or incapacity supplement to persons in receipt of certain welfare payments, including deserted wife's benefit.  The abolition of concurrent payments is confined to new applicants for jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit or incapacity supplement and will take effect from 1 February 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1436">There are currently almost 96,000 individuals in receipt of a rent supplement payment at a cost of some €500million to the State in 2011.  Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that the person, after payment of rent, has an income equal to the basic supplementary welfare allowance rate, less a specified weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">The type of payments to which the Deputy refers are known as "top up" payments and fall into two specific categories.  Where persons have an additional income from employment above the rate of supplementary welfare allowance they are, in certain circumstances, allowed to top up their rent as they will still have sufficient income to meet their basic needs after paying their rent.  The second type of top up payment can occur where the application to the Department declares a rent lower than that actually being charged by the landlord. Any instance of false declarations should be reported to the relevant Department officials who have specific legislative powers to deal with such matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_1439">The transitional payment was introduced to assist recipients of the one-parent family payment (OFP) in their transition to employment.   Until 31 December, 2011, recipients of the OFP for 52 consecutive weeks, whose income exceeded the scheme's €425 weekly earnings disregard limit, were entitled to the transitional payment, which was paid at half of the rate of their OFP, for a period of 26 weeks, after which payment would cease completely.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">From 1 January 2012, the transitional payment will no longer be awarded to new and existing OFP recipients. Their entitlement to the OFP payment will automatically end if their earnings exceed the €425 weekly earnings disregard limit.  The approximately 225 existing recipients of the transitional payment are not affected by this reform and will continue to receive the payment for the balance of six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">The current transitional payment was introduced in 2005 when the weekly earnings disregard limit for the receipt of the OFP payment was €293.  This has been increased substantially since then, so that an OFP recipient with earnings of up to €425 per week can still receive a significant rate of OFP.  It is in this context, and in light of the current requirement for reductions in social welfare expenditure, that the decision to abolish the transitional payment has been made.  There are no plans to reverse this decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_1444">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 36 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">There are currently almost 96,000 individuals in receipt of a rent supplement payment at a cost of some €500million to the State in 2011.  Two main initiatives are currently being pursued by the Department to transfer long-term rent supplement recipients to housing solutions supported by local authorities.  These are the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) and the new housing policy initiative launched in June 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">The RAS, which was introduced in 2004, gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people who receive rent supplement for 18 months or more.  Local authorities meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches, including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the RAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">Latest figures (end December 2011) from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government indicate that, to date, local authorities have transferred a total of 37,759 households from rent supplement (RS).  Of these 21,892 were housed directly under RAS and a further 15,867 were accommodated under other social housing options.    In June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing published a new housing policy framework statement.  The object, in terms of reform, is the transfer of the rent supplement scheme to local authorities.  A multi-agency steering group chaired by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with representatives from the Departments of Social Protection; Public Expenditure and Reform; the County and City Managers Association, and the Housing Agency is considering the implementation of this transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">These two initiatives will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment, while at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short-term income support payment for those who are temporarily unemployed.  The initiatives will also address the recommendation contained in the report referred to by the Deputy "Ireland's Competitiveness Challenge 2011" that is "housing related entitlements are transferred out of the social welfare system, and into a separate dedicated housing stream where entitlement would depend on income levels rather than employment status i.e. decoupling housing support from social welfare payments".</p>

         the reason she failed to conduct an assessment of the impact of her budgetary measure cutting the redundancy rebate from 60% to 15% on companies; and the reason she did not direct her Department to explore whether the measure could be linked in some way to the size of the firm, its profitability or capacity to absorb the cut.

            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_1450">There is little doubt that the recent reduction in the redundancy rebate to employers will have an impact on companies. However, a reduction in the size of the redundancy rebate would not necessarily reduce the size of redundancy payments made to workers.  Many employers are anxious to ensure that their former employees are adequately compensated in the event of redundancy and pay their former employees in excess of the statutory minimum requirement.   Redundancy payment practices in this country have been out of step with arrangements in other jurisdictions.  For example:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1451">In Sweden there is no statutory system of redundancy payments from the employers;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1452">In Spain the employer cannot claim back any amount from the State;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1453">In the Netherlands there is no rebate to employers;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1454">In Cyprus the employers are obliged to pay a monthly contribution of 1.2% on the earnings of their employees to the Redundancy Fund so as to cover redundancy;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1455">In Slovakia the employer cannot claim any part of the cost back from State;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1456">In Finland there is no statutory redundancy;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1457">In the UK the redundancy payment is funded by the employer and there is no recovery from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">The total amount paid out in redundancy rebates to employers alone was €152.2 million in 2006; €167.4 million in 2007; €161.8 million in 2008; €247.9 million in 2009; €373.2 million in 2010 and €185.3 million so far in 2011. The amounts paid out in lump sums to employees have also increased.  While redundancy rebates to employers are paid out of the Social Insurance Fund (SIF), the SIF itself has had to be supported by taxpayers' funds in recent years.  The current operating balance of the SIF moved into deficit in 2008 when expenditure exceeded income by €231million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">Significant annual savings can be expected as a result of this measure to reduce the rebate. The measure was not linked to the characteristics of a firm as I do not wish to discriminate against any company operating in the Irish economy.  It should be noted that there has been a high cost associated with the relocation of Irish jobs to other countries by multinationals. This practice has effectively been subsidised by the high level of rebates.</p>

            <p eId="para_1461">As part of Budget 2012, the Government decided that the amount of earnings disregarded for the purposes of the One Parent Family Payment (OFP) means test would be reduced from €146.50 to €130.00 per week in 2012 for new and existing recipients. Further reductions will be introduced over the following four years.   Evidence suggests that the earnings disregard has been successful in encouraging people to enter employment. However, it may also have had the effect of trapping lone parents in low-paid part-time employment in order to keep their earnings below the disregard. The result is that, despite the fact that many lone parents are in employment, relatively small numbers are moving off the OFP scheme because their earnings exceed the upper limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">Social assistance provision to people of working age was the subject of a review carried out by the Department and published in November 2010. The review considered the desirability and feasibility of introducing a single social assistance payment for people of working age.  This approach would end the use of various contingencies in social assistance — for example, lone parenthood, unemployed status and disability. It would focus instead on the person and on their individual capacities and outcomes rather than on the payment type that they are in. The rationale for such a payment is that people are given or directed to the supports or services that they need in order to return to or take up employment, training or educational opportunities, matched by a requirement that they avail of that support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">The reduction in the OFP disregards facilitates the proposed single social assistance payment for people of working age.  It is a necessary reform and I have no plans to revise or reverse it.</p>

            <p eId="para_1465">Payments made to participants on a Community Employment (CE) Scheme and the Job Initiative (JI) Scheme are social-welfare-like payments and are therefore exempt from the Universal Social Charge (USC). Revenue has instructed CE and JI Scheme employers that USC does not apply to these exempt payments. If a participant on a CE scheme is also employed <i>outside</i>   of the CE scheme in a part-time capacity and earns in excess of €10,036 per annum, he/she would pay USC on this second employment. If the earnings are below the above threshold, the employment earnings in the non-CE job would be USC-exempt.  FÁS training course allowances are also considered exempt for USC purposes, with the exception of Apprenticeship payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_1488">The person concerned was awarded disability allowance with effect from 14/07/1993.  Following a review of his claim he was disallowed disability allowance with effect from 21/07/2011 as his means, derived from compensation he received, exceeded the limit for receipt of the allowance.  The person appealed this decision and I understand from the Social Welfare Appeals Office that his case has been put down for oral hearing and will be heard within the next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">In relation to the underlying policy issue, removing compensation awarded for damages from means assessment could give rise to anomalies.  If, as is the case in most instances, compensation is awarded at least in part to replace lost income, it raises the question as to why the social welfare system would also provide income maintenance.  Furthermore, it would be problematic to treat two otherwise similar individuals or families differently from one another simply because of the source of their capital or income.  In any event, such a policy change would have to be considered in a budgetary context, given the additional costs that would arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1491">The National Internship Scheme provides internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months for unemployed individuals on the Live Register, in organisations in the private, public and community voluntary sectors.  The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.  The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register.  It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register.  The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  The extension of JobBridge to those in receipt of One Parent Family Payments forms part of this broader review process.  Individuals in receipt of a One Parent Family Payment may access a wide range of activation supports including the Work Placement Programme, which is designed to provide participants with valuable work experience, thereby improving their prospects of securing employment.</p>

         the average number of weeks it is currently taking to register a social welfare appeal; the average time it is taking to allocate an appeal to an inspector; the average time it is taking to decide the appeal; the average time it is taking to decide the appeal in cases in which there is an oral hearing; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1496">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that figures are not available as to the average time taken to register an appeal, such time being subject to the numbers of appeals to the Office at any given time.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  In that regard, the average length of time for this process in 2011 was 13.7 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">On their return to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, files are prepared for vetting before being assigned to an Appeals Officer who will either decide the case summarily or schedule it for an oral hearing.  While there are no figures for the average time it takes to allocate a file to an Appeals Officer, the average time for the finalisation of an appeal following the return of a file from the Department in 2011 was 11.4 weeks in the case of summary decisions and 38.8 weeks following oral hearings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 9 additional Appeals Officers during 2011 that augmented the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010.  In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brings the total number of Appeals Officers to 39.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</p>

            <p eId="para_1503">I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 121 and 124 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">Statistics are not available on the average length of time taken to assess mortgage interest supplement or other supplementary welfare allowance applications.  The timescale for determining applications is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements etc.  In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">The provision of a prompt service is a major objective for the Department's staff dealing with applications.  However, this is tempered by the necessity to ensure that every case is fully investigated and that all cases are dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.  While certain applications may take more time to process than others, I am satisfied that the Department's staff dealing with these applications make every effort to ensure claims are processed efficiently and that the appropriate levels of oversight and controls are in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Statistics are not available on the number of mortgage interest supplement, rent supplement and basic supplementary welfare allowance applications received for the past 3 years and to date in 2012 or the outcome of those applications.  However, I am attaching a tabular statement showing the number of basic supplementary welfare allowance, rent supplement and mortgage interest supplement claims awarded in each of the past 3 years and to date in 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1529">Two schemes are available to assist people on certain social welfare payments who wish to become self-employed; namely the short term enterprise allowance (STEA) and the back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA).  The STEA provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseeker's benefit wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and duration as their entitlement to jobseeker's benefit.  There were 1,294 people availing of this scheme on the 31st December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">The BTWEA is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependent on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits, over two years; 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  In the case of jobseekers, the qualifying period required for access to BTWEA is 12 months, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance.  At the end of 2011, there were 10,751 participants on this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">Under both schemes, the proposed business must be approved as viable and sustainable by an Integrated Development Company (Partnership) or a Department facilitator.  Further support is provided to people who qualify for STEA or BTWEA through the technical assistance and training scheme (TATS), under which a participant may qualify for a grant up to a maximum of €1,000 towards certain business start-up expenses.  These include training and the purchase of small items of equipment.  TATS are administered through the facilitator network based in social welfare local offices which also provides information and support services to people considering starting their own business.

            <p eId="para_1533">The Government has taken a number of actions with respect to tackling unemployment, including those announced recently in the Budget.  The key challenges facing the Government are:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1534">to create and maintain the conditions where employment can thrive.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1535">providing incentives for job creation through the tax system and the supports available to new enterprises and those going through restructuring.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1536">removing obstacles, red tape and other disincentives on employers to take on new workers, including those arising in the social welfare system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">Following the transfer of the community welfare scheme and the employment and community services element of FÁS in recent months, significant work is being undertaken on the development of better systems and approach to enhancing the activation and work placement opportunities at local level.  These will ensure that there is a more proactive engagement with people on the Live Register to provide opportunities for work, education and training.  Over the coming months my Department will be able to engage on a more regular basis with those on the Live Register and offer more targeted activation options and opportunities.  Allied to this will be a need for a more in-depth engagement at local level with employers and other agencies which can offer jobs, training and educational opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">I intend to build on the implementation of Tús — the community work placement initiative and JobBridge — the national internship programme, which I introduced during 2011.  Together, these initiatives are engaging some 6,000 people today.  The Deputy may wish to note the distribution of placements on community employment and Tús is based on the regional incidence of unemployment.  My Department is also currently undertaking a review of the effectiveness of a range of activation measures.  The outcome of this review will be used to determine future policy initiatives and will assist the targeting of resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_1542">Work is progressing rapidly on the Intergovernmental Treaty to give effect to the political agreement reached in December on a new "Fiscal Compact".  The Government has been working intensively, at the negotiating table, in Brussels, and in capitals, to make sure that our key points are understood and addressed appropriately.  To that end we have offered our views both orally and in writing, including on the detailed elements of the text.  Senior Irish officials have been very active in meeting their counterparts, and we have sought to secure the support of all potential allies on issues of importance to us.  We will continue to do this as the process evolves.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">At the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 23 January, I met with my counterparts from Austria, Portugal, Luxembourg, Finland and the Netherlands to explain and seek support for Irish positions on the new Treaty.  In all of my discussions I have made it clear that once a final text is available the Government will seek the formal view of the Attorney General on what will be required to allow Ireland to ratify the Treaty.  Only then will we know if a referendum will be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">The test will be whether the proposed Treaty is compatible with the Constitution.  As the Government has confirmed previously, the Attorney General will study the legal implications carefully, and will advise on what steps will be necessary to enable Ireland to ratify. Until then it is simply not possible to be definitive.  The Government has made it clear previously, if a referendum is required, one will be held.  The Oireachtas will be fully involved in the ratification process, as appropriate, including in the preparation of any relevant legislation.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Eamon Gilmore)</from>
            <p eId="para_1547">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">Addressing the situation of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States remain important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.  The Taoiseach and I discussed these issues with President Obama when we met with him on 23 May last year in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">During the course of 2011, I also discussed the issue of Irish immigration with Secretary of State Clinton and Senator Patrick Leahy, Chair of the Senate Judiciary committee.  I also met with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York.  The Government has provided almost $365,000 to support that organisation since 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">A particular focus of the Government's efforts has been on the achievement of E-3 visas for Ireland.  These E-3s are non-immigrant worker visas, renewable every two years and are currently available to Australian citizens.  Provisions which would allow Irish nationals to apply for E-3 visas were amongst those included in the comprehensive immigration reform Bill as introduced in the US Senate last June by senior Democrats, including Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer and Robert Menendez.  This Bill would also have helped to resolve the position of the undocumented, including the Irish.  Unfortunately, and not least due to the current US domestic political climate and the Presidential elections taking place there later this year, to date that Bill has not yet received the additional bi-partisan support which it would require to make further progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">Another significant development occurred at the end of November when draft legislation entitled the "Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act" (Bill No. HR 3012) emerged from the House of Representatives. Although the political climate for any immigration reform measures remains challenging, the broad bi-partisan support which this draft legislation secured suggested that there might be scope to make progress on Irish E-3s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">In early December, Senators Schumer, Leahy and Durbin, all of whom hold leadership positions on the Democratic side of the Senate, came together to co-sponsor a further version of the ‘Fairness' legislation that would include provision under which Irish nationals could apply for up to 10,500 E-3 visas each year.  The Schumer/Leahy/Durbin Bill (number S.1983) also included ‘administrative waiver' provisions which would allow undocumented Irish migrants in the US to apply for E-3s without suffering certain applicable penalties for having been out of status.</p>
            <p eId="para_1553">Separately, Senators Scott Brown and Mark Kirk of the Republican Party tabled further stand-alone legislative proposals (Bill number S. 2005) that would also make Irish nationals eligible to apply for up to 10,500 E-3 visas each year but which do not include the additional ‘administrative waiver' provisions.  Both Bills have since been referred for examination by the US Senate's Judiciary Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">While recent developments have been encouraging, the prospects for these Bills are uncertain.  Acting on my behalf, our Embassy in Washington, working with the Irish-American immigration community, continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the US Administration at senior levels and with both parties in the US Congress.  I will also be in Washington in early February where I will be engaging with key players to further advance our support for an Irish E-3 visa.</p>

            <p eId="para_1560">As I outlined previous in answers to Parliamentary Questions (22113/11 and 22117/11), the basis for stabilization of the Irish banking market is contained in my Statement on Banking of 31 March, 2011, where I set out Government policy in relation to the matters the Deputy has raised.  A fundamental element of Government Strategy has been to restore a functioning banking system and the Government has made particular commitments to recapitalising the banks and restructuring the banking sector as part of its Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">This radical restructuring of the banking system is designed to put our banking system on a firm footing which is essential to Ireland's economic recovery.  The continuing positive reviews delivered by the Troika, as well as further technical discussions reinforces the direction of the Banking Policy and allows us to continue on the path to stability and economic growth in core businesses based on a sound and well capitalised banking system with two pillar institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">While there are, at present, a number of foreign owned entities that operate within the Irish banking market, I would welcome further interest that foreign entities may have in entering the Irish market.  This interest will continue to grow as the economy recovers and banking returns to viability.</p>

        <b> Deputy Dominic Hannigan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         if he will consider a change to the VAT regime for travel agents to enable them to offer gross wholesale accommodation prices to Irish agents in order that they can compete on an equal footing with travel agents from the UK who do not have to charge VAT on their offers and are at a competitive advantage; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelNoonan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_635">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1564">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 88 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 provides for a scheme for travel agents known as the Travel Agents Margin Scheme (TAMS).  The scheme deals with the activities carried on by travel agents who act in the capacity of a principal when supplying certain travel services such as transport, accommodation, etc, which they have bought in from third parties for onward supply to travellers.  Under the scheme, which is provided for in the EU VAT Directive, such travel agents are liable to VAT at the standard rate in respect of the margin on their supply of travel services, not in respect of the overall consideration they receive for such services. The scheme, which was introduced with effect from 1 January 2010, operates in all EU States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">Supplies of travel services, e.g. accommodation, transport, etc., between travel agents, known as wholesale supplies, are not covered by the Margin Scheme but are subject to VAT at the rates applicable to those services in the normal way.  If a travel agent established in Ireland acquires accommodation services from another travel agent, also established in Ireland, that other travel agent will charge VAT on the supply at the second reduced rate, currently 9%.  The travel agent who acquires the accommodation and supplies it to a traveller will charge VAT on the margin at the standard rate, currently 23%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">If a travel agent in Ireland acquires accommodation services from a UK based agent, then that UK travel agent must register for VAT in Ireland and charge Irish VAT on all such supplies regardless of value.  The Irish travel agent who acquires the accommodation and supplies it to a traveller will charge VAT on the margin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">In relation to wholesale supplies described above, the same VAT treatment applies to the supplies made by both the travel agent established in Ireland and the agent established in the UK.  Therefore, the question of a competitive advantage should not arise.  If the Deputy believes this is not the case I suggest that he provide the details to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_1571">The processing of applications for charitable tax exemption is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners.  I am informed by Revenue that to avail of the exemption a body or trust must be established for charitable purposes only and must apply all its income for charitable purposes.  Procedures are in place by Revenue towards ensuring that the tax exemption is only granted to bodies that meet the necessary criteria for such exemption<b>. </b> These comprise an application procedure, which includes the submission of a Governing Instrument.  The objects and powers of a body applying for charitable tax exemption must also be framed in a manner that ensures its income or property can be applied only for charitable purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">The number of applications for charitable tax exemptions during the last 7 years, together with the number approved is outlined in the table. It should be noted that some applications are refused when the full supporting information is received with the application and it is clear that an exemption is not appropriate. In other instances the application is not pursued further when the applicants become aware of the necessary criteria for such exemption and the administrative procedures required to ensure ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the exemption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">Once a fully completed application form and all supporting documentation requested by Revenue is received, applications are processed in accordance with Revenue's Customer Service Standards i.e. 80% within 10 working days and 100% within 20 working days.</p>

            <p eId="para_1614">I propose to take Questions Nos. 66, 75 and 81 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">Last October the Government published the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears and, as the Deputies are aware, the Report was subsequently the subject of an extensive Dáil debate.  The implementation of the report's recommendations is a key part of the Government's ongoing efforts to tackle mortgage difficulty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">A Steering Group, chaired by a Second Secretary General in my Department, has been established to oversee and drive the overall implementation of the report's recommendations and to report regularly to the Economic Management Council and to Government on this.  In addition to the Department of Finance, the Steering Group also consists of senior representation from the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Central Bank is also represented on the Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">Separate working groups have also been established to progress the individual work streams of this broad work area and these groups report to the overall Steering Group.  Additionally, a dedicated team is being established in my Department, with resources drawn from the relevant Government Departments, to progress the relevant initiatives.  This will be supplemented, as necessary, with additional legal, financial and technical expertise as the implementation work proceeds.  Significant progress has already been achieved across a number of the individual work areas.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1618">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence has now produced an initial General Scheme of a Personal Insolvency Bill which proposes a reformed framework to enable unsustainable debt, including the sensitive issue of secured debt, to be resolved in a non judicial way.  This General Scheme will be furnished to the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration.  Their views, along with the views of other interested parties, will be taken into account in the further development and finalisation of the Bill.  The intention is to publish a final Bill by end April in line with the revised commitment in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1619">On "mortgage to rent", the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government has advanced work with a bank and a social housing association to pilot a scheme, in order to test the practicalities and develop models associated with such a measure in advance of a wider roll out.  I am informed that discussions are ongoing and that an initial launch of the project is anticipated soon.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1620">Regarding the engagement with the banks, the Central Bank, as the regulator of credit institutions, has now received mortgage arrears resolution strategies and implementation plans from all mortgage lenders and these are being considered by the Central Bank.  I have been informed that the Central Bank intends to provide feedback to mortgage lenders in the coming weeks to give lenders an opportunity to revise and update their plans.  The overall aim of this engagement is to ensure that there is a robust framework in place at all mortgage lenders to deliver appropriate solutions to their mortgage customers who are in arrears.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1621">Finally, work has commenced on the necessary steps to put in place the mortgage advisory function as recommended by the Inter-Departmental group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">The Government has also indicated that, in its ongoing consideration of appropriate measures to address this problem, it will take careful note of the suggestions made by Deputies and also by outside groups.  It is the Government's intention to continue to work intensively on this matter and to significantly further advance all these work measures in the early part of 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1624">The Central Bank have advised me that the current version of their Consumer Protection Code (2012) was finalised following extensive consultation.  The Consumer Protection Code was originally introduced in 2006. The purpose of the Code is to strengthen protection for consumers by introducing clear conduct of business rules for all regulated entities in order to increase the standards of service to consumers and to ensure that consumers are provided with financial products that are suitable for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">During 2010 and 2011 the Central Bank undertook a review of the 2006 Code in order to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1626">address issues that had arisen during their consumer-focused inspections,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1627">take account of market intelligence received, and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1628">provide clarity on the impact of EU legislation and other developments which had arisen since the Code was first introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">In October 2010, the Central Bank published a consultation paper on their proposed revision of the 2006 Code and issued a second consultation paper in June 2011. Among the respondents were the Irish Brokers' Association, the Professional Insurance Brokers' Association and the Irish Insurance Federation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">The Central Bank have advised me that, following a review of the submissions received, they decided to strengthen protection for consumers against unsolicited personal visits from representatives of firms regulated by the Central Bank. They have also advised me that the provisions set out in sections 3.37-3.45 in the current version of the Code are a combination of the 2006 Code requirements for telephone contact and stricter rules in relation to personal visits, with unsolicited personal visits prohibited.  I have no evidence to suggest that a ban on cold calling would impact negatively on employment in the insurance sector.  The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code may be accessed on the Central Bank's website <i>www.CentralBank.ie.</i>

            <p eId="para_1632">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, up to the tax year 2011, income tax relief is available for individuals who pay service charges to local authorities and other independent contractors. Qualifying charges include all service charges paid to:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1633">local authorities for the provision of domestic water supply, domestic refuse collection or disposal, or domestic sewage disposal;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1634">group water schemes for domestic water supply; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1635">independent contractors for domestic refuse collection or disposal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1636">The relief is given at the standard rate of tax (20%) for any qualifying service charges paid in full and on time in the previous calendar year.  The maximum annual amount of qualifying service charges in respect of which tax relief may be claimed is €400.   For example, for services charges paid in respect of the years 2007 to 2010, the tax relief given in the tax years 2008 to 2011 is the lesser of—</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1637">(a) the amount of services charges paid in the previous tax year @ 20%; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1638">(b) €400 @ 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1639">The Commission on Taxation recommended that this relief should be discontinued on the basis that it had originally been introduced as a short-term measure and that the "polluter pays" principle should underpin the charging process for local authority services and should not be diluted by the provision of tax relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1640">Accordingly, and mindful also of the overall Exchequer position, this relief was abolished by Section 12 of the Finance Act 2010.  The final year for which the relief may be claimed is the 2011 tax year as respects service charges paid in 2010.  Income Tax relief in respect of trade union subscriptions was introduced in 2001.  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, up to the tax year 2010, income tax relief is available for individuals who paid trade union subscriptions.  For the tax years 2008 to 2010, the maximum amount of subscription in respect of which tax relief is available is €350 and the rate of tax relief is at the standard rate of tax (20%).</p>
            <p eId="para_1641">The most recent year for which the necessary detailed information is available regarding tax relief for trade union subscriptions is the income tax year 2009, in which the cost to the Exchequer is estimated at approximately €26.7 million.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that the relief should be discontinued on the basis that membership of a trade union is more likely to be influenced by the benefits of membership. Furthermore, the Commission considered that there was a significant element of deadweight associated with this tax relief.  Taking into account the overall Exchequer position and the views of the Commission on Taxation, relief for Trade Union subscriptions was abolished by Section 12 of the Finance Act 2011 with effect from 1 January 2011.</p>

Significant competitive tension in respect of fees was created by virtue of 30% of the marks being allocated to fees.  In addition,  under the rules of the framework tenderers may be asked to re-compete on fees.   No services have been called off the framework to-date, however, NAMA has assured me that, given the scale of fees quoted by the successful tendering parties, it is confident of achieving value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_1646">Savings Certificates and Savings Bonds are tax free to Irish residents.  Interest is applied on these products at maturity, which is after five and a half years for Savings Certificates and after three years for Savings Bonds, or on encashment, which could be at any stage during the life of the product.   Bringing the products within the Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) regime would lead to an estimated yield of €44m, based on the estimated interest payout on Savings Certificates and Bonds in 2011.  The potential yield has been estimated on the basis of applying the higher DIRT rate which applies to interest paid less frequently than annually, as is the case with Savings Certificates and Savings Bonds, rather than the standard DIRT rate which applies to interest paid annually or more frequently than annually.  The higher DIRT rate in 2011 was 30%, which was increased to 33% with effect from 1 January 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1650">The decision on whether or not to grant a loan to a borrower or to allow a borrower to switch to another mortgage account must remain a commercial decision for the lending institution concerned. It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the risks that it is considering when deciding whether or not to approve a loan or to make adjustments to an existing loan arrangement.   The banking announcement on 31 March 2011 restructured the domestic banks to ensure that there is over €20 billion of new mortgage and SME lending available from the two pillar banks (AIB and Bank of Ireland) between 2011 and 2013. I understand that Bank of Ireland has already announced a special fund for new buyers and that other mortgage lending institutions are considering launching mortgage initiatives shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1651">The changes which I announced in last month's Budget means that individuals who take out qualifying loans in 2012 as first time buyers will now receive relief at a rate of 25% on ceilings of €10,000/€20,000, single/married as opposed to the previously proposed rate of 15% on ceilings of €3,000/€6,000. This will give a maximum relief in 2012 of €2,500 for single and €5,000 for married persons.</p>

            <p eId="para_1655">The term "structural deficit" refers to the general government deficit adjusted for the economic cycle and one-off measures.  It is the deficit that would prevail if transitory elements in the headline deficit owing to economic fluctuations and temporary/one-off factors (e.g. State injections into the banking system) were removed. The structural deficit provides greater clarity regarding the underlying fiscal position, though it is difficult to measure especially in a small open economy such as Ireland's, as the Fiscal Council acknowledged in its recent report. As such, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding all estimates of the structural deficit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1656">Budget 2012 provided an estimate of the structural deficit for last year. On the basis of a headline deficit of 10.1 per cent of GDP, and using the harmonised production function methodology developed jointly by the European Commission and Member States to identify the cyclical position of the economy, a structural deficit of 8.6 per cent of GDP was estimated for 2011.  Using this same methodology and taking account of one-off measures in 2008, 2009 and 2010, my Department's estimates of the structural deficit for the years 2008-10 are set out in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_1690">As the deputy will be aware the covered banks are required to deleverage circa €70bn of assets by 31 December 2013. To date significant progress has been made in that regard.  The two pillar banks met the 2011 deleveraging targets with almost €15 billion of these assets sold at significantly better pricing than anticipated in the PCAR/PLAR 2011 exercise. Total deleveraging achieved across government supported banks was €40.5 billion through end November 2011 against full year 2011 expected deleveraging of €34.7 billion.  In addition, Irish banks enjoyed deposit inflows in the final quarter of 2011 despite the very difficult international environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">It is important to maintain the progress in downsizing our banking system which was made in 2011, and while we have not requested an extension to the deleveraging programme, we are working to refine the deleveraging framework to minimize risks to lending to the economy and discourage excessive competition for deposits. Nonetheless, it is also important, as part of the overall strategy to maintain progress in regard to deleveraging and this momentum will ensure that banks will better able to support the real economy in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">As things stand the banking system restructuring plan creates capacity for the two Pillar Banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, to provide lending in excess of €30 billion in the next three years.  SME and new mortgage lending for these banks is expected to be in the range of €16-20bn over this period. The Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  The position will be monitored on an on-going basis and discussed with EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF with any refinements or adjustments required considered and addressed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1696">My Department maintains close and on-going contact with the Central bank/Financial Regulator on all financial, stability and regulatory matters.  Likewise, there is also close contact with appropriate external authorities.  The Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator provided advice to the Minister at the time of nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the effective nationalisation of Irish Nationwide Building Society (INBS).  The ECB did not provide specific advice to the Minister in relation to these institutions prior to nationalisation.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January 2009 while INBS was effectively nationalised in March 2010.  It is important to note that, at no time were either of the institutions declared insolvent and the provision of capital and support by the Government has prevented insolvency and any consequential call under the various Guarantee Schemes.  IBRC, the merged entity, comprising both these institutions, remains solvent and in compliance with all regulatory and capital requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">Both institutions were regarded as systemically important credit institutions and were managed and dealt with on that basis by all the Irish regulatory authorities.  Failure of such important institutions would have had serious and immediate financial an economic implications.  Having consulted with the Central Bank capital was provided to the institutions to ensure that they continued to meet all regulatory capital requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">The circumstances surrounding the decisions to deal with the institutions are very different.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank the Department knew, prior to nationalisation, that capital would be required, that funding at the bank was problematic and that certain risks, including governance issues, could, if not mitigated, materially impact on the bank.  However, the bank was not adjudged insolvent at that time.  The audited accounts for the period, and assessments by the Financial Regulator,  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and Merrill Lynch all indicated that the bank was solvent and could absorb "stress level" losses over the period of review and projected strong capital adequacy ratios out to 2013.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised because of governance issues, and funding problems in particular which would very quickly have placed the bank in a position of inability to repay maturing debt including deposits, with a major and immediate knock-on impact on other banks and on the State.  Further, there was strong negative market sentiment towards the bank which was impacting on the banking sector generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">With the benefit of hindsight, however, it is now clear that the full extent of the evolving  problems in global financial crisis or the property market were not envisaged in any assessment of the bank at that time.  In the course of 2009/2010 the extent of the problems became clear and the level of impairments on assets increased substantially necessitating further injections of capital to sustain the capital position of the bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">In the case of INBS it became clear in the course of 2009 that the Society was in breach of its own funds solvency ratio.  The Central bank/Financial Regulator reported on this.  This problem persisted and the Minister was forced to intervene, to provide specific guarantees and eventually to effectively nationalise the institution in early 2010 in order to protect the solvency of the institution and a call on the State guarantee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">Throughout this period the Central Bank/Financial Regulator provided advice to the Minister.  Other institutions which provided advice to the Minister over that period included the NTMA, PWC, Merrill Lynch, Arthur Cox, Rothschild.</p>

            <p eId="para_1706">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">The implementation of a jobs and growth strategy is a key priority of this Government.  The Jobs Initiative contains a range of measures aimed at assisting in employment generation — providing opportunities for those who are out of work, to restore public morale and confidence in the economy and encourage spending by consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">The Jobs Initiative was designed to be budget-neutral over the four year period 2011-2014.  However, it is important to note that it was expected to bring in a small net positive amount to the Exchequer in 2011.  This is because the yield from the temporary levy on pension funds which was introduced to fund the Jobs Initiative was greater than the estimated cost of the other measures introduced.  These included a new 9% VAT rate, the halving of the lower rate of PRSI and small amounts of additional current and capital expenditure.  The goal of the Jobs Initiative is not direct economic stimulus but rather a targeting of resources towards more employment-rich areas of activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">In terms of the specific detail on the full range of expenditure and revenue measures, officials from my own Department and Minister Howlin's worked closely with other Departments in preparing the proposals and assessing the quantitative and qualitative impacts.  The estimated yield and costs associated with the various measures introduced are set out in detail in the summary of policy measures section of the Jobs Initiative booklet.  A summary of the original measures and associated estimated yield and costs is set out in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_1755">The labour market is still in a weak state, as confirmed by the latest CSO Quarterly National Household Survey data.  The unemployment rate is unacceptably high and people are still losing jobs.  At the same time, some jobs are being created though it is difficult to assess the number as official employment data are presented in net terms and information on gross flows into and out of employment is not available.  Some information can be gleaned from the live register however.  This shows that 144,000 left the live register to take up employment last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">I am confident that the measures introduced by the Government in May 2011, such as reducing the rate of VAT in the high value added tourism sector, have played a role in this respect.  This view is shared by my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation, who only yesterday informed the House that a significant number of jobs were created in the tourism sector on foot of measures set out in the Jobs Initiative.</p>

            <p eId="para_1766">The new simplified approach to the General Allocation Model of support for schools will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school.  Schools will also have autonomy on how to deploy the resource between language support and learning support depending on their specific needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1767">The arrangements for the staffing allocation under the General Allocation Model (GAM) are specifically designed to facilitate GAM hours being clustered into full-time posts — either entirely within their own school or with a nearby neighbouring school.  The new GAM allocations are being done in five-hour blocks which is the equivalent of the tuition time for a full school day.  Teachers that are in shared posts between schools can therefore operate local arrangements that enable their travel to a neighbouring school to be done, where possible, from the start of the school day thus avoiding loss of tuition time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1768">As part of the reforms to the teacher allocation process existing posts will be used to put in place a network of about 2,450 full-time resource posts in over 1,600 base schools throughout the country that will be allocated on a permanent basis.  This approach builds on the interim arrangements that operated in 2011 but in a more structured and transparent manner.  The annual changes in resource hours at individual school level will only affect where the teacher is working on any one day — not whether the base school continues to host the full-time post.  This approach will introduce a greater constancy in the context of the annual allocations and redeployment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1769">The teachers in these full-time resource posts will undertake NCSE approved (low incidence) resource hours in the base schools or in neighbouring schools.  Schools are typically notified of their NCSE approved resource hours in the late Spring/early Summer period but also throughout the school year.  Through his/her role in allocating resources the local SENO will have an oversight role in relation to the sharing arrangements between schools so that they can operate as efficiently as possible and any time loss due to travel between schools can be kept to a minimum.  Schools that are unable to access their NCSE approved resource hours from this network of full-time resource posts will be allocated mainly part-time temporary posts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1771">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. This includes the allocation of resource teaching hours to schools as well as the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1772">The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such supports.  Second level schools which have enrolled pupils with an assessed special educational need are allocated additional resource teaching support on the basis of the pupil's special educational needs.  Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.  It is open to parents to contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), which was established under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, is charged with ensuring each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  While responsibility for the National Educational Welfare Board has transferred to my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the two Departments are working together to ensure the services in the NEWB, including the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison and the Education Welfare Service have a renewed focus to more effectively target and support all children at risk.</p>

            <p eId="para_1775">The Deputy will be aware that a number of sections of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act have already been commenced.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) made recommendations which suggested that additional investment over a period of years of up to €235 million per annum, across the education and health sectors, would be required to fully implement the EPSEN Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">My Department's opinion is that the level of investment required would be greater than that envisaged in the NCSE report.  In the light of the very difficult economic situation, and these significant costs, the previous Government deferred the full implementation of EPSEN.  Given the costs involved and current fiscal constraints, addressing this issue will be very challenging.  I will consider how we can develop a plan to implement the objectives of the EPSEN Act so as to deliver improved educational outcomes for students with special needs.</p>

         his strategy for ensuring that the tradition of providing education in denominational schools for the Protestant community will be protected in view of cuts to pupil-teacher ratios in one, two, three and four teacher schools in budget 2012 as well as suggestions that smaller schools should look at amalgamating; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Ruairí Quinn)</from>
            <p eId="para_1778">Along with my colleagues in Government, I recognise the importance of ensuring students from a Protestant background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos.  At a time of great strain in our public finances, however, we have to ensure the valuable but limited resources available for the education system are used in the best way possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The staffing schedule at primary level disproportionately benefits small primary schools.  It is worth noting that we have 3,200 primary schools across Ireland.  Over two thirds of those schools have more than 86 pupils and, as a result, have far higher average class sizes than all of the schools affected by this measure.  A two-teacher school with 32 pupils, for example, has an average class size of one teacher for 16 pupils.  In contrast, a typical ten-teacher school with 272 pupils has an average class size of 27.2 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">It is important to retain a sense of perspective and balance when discussing this matter and to understand that the Department will continue to provide exceptionally favourable supports to small schools.  For that reason, as part of the Budget 2012 decisions, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  Even when all of these phased increases are implemented, the threshold for small schools will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that was required for the appointment of a second teacher in schools prior to the mid-1990s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.  My Department will be notifying schools in the coming weeks of the new staffing arrangements for 2012-13 school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1786">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The relevant appointment and retention figures for mainstream staffing for the coming school year have been published on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1787">However, the staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of other budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process. The reform of the allocation process is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools so there will inevitably be some schools that will lose posts and some schools that will gain posts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1793">The Government intention in introducing the Jobs Initiative 2011 was to focus our now more limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy.  The Jobs Initiative 2011 is one element of a wider strategy to support economic activity.  The aim is to target key sectors of the economy that can assist in getting people back to work, providing opportunities for those who have lost their jobs to re-skill and building confidence in order to encourage consumer activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">Given our commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, and our current public finance difficulties, the Jobs Initiative 2011   was constructed to be budgetary neutral over the period to 2014.   Funding of current expenditure measures announced in the Jobs Initiative is being met from a combination of re-prioritisation of existing resources and additional funding arising from the introduction of a temporary levy on pension funds.  The total additional current expenditure to specified areas of €29 million in 2011 was to be funded by reallocations of €18 million from within existing current resources and €11 million from the introduction of the levy on pension funds in 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">In a full year the total additional current expenditure to specified areas of €45 million was to be funded through €15 million of the additional expenditure from within existing resources and €30 million from the levy on pension funds.  The full set of current expenditure measures are set out in the table.   The detailed allocations for voted expenditure in 2012 and the provisional outturn for expenditure in 2011 will be published next month as part of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1809">The capital expenditure measures in the Jobs Initiative announced by the Minister for Finance last year applied to 2011 only.  The aim of these measures was to accelerate capital works that are shovel ready, have a local focus and are labour intensive.  Schools and secondary roads works were identified as being the most appropriate for such purposes, while also representing areas where investment has broader benefits to society and the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">The Jobs Initiative provided an additional €30 million for labour intensive school works and associated works in 2011 over the existing allocation. Some €20 million of this was reallocated by the Minister for Education and Skills from within his own Department's allocation and the remaining €10 million was provided to the Department from the proceeds of the new pension levy announced in the Initiative.  This was allocated to "ready-to-go" projects to be delivered by schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1815">As announced in my address to Dáil Éireann on Expenditure Estimates 2012 on 5 December 2011, public service bodies have to achieve a reduction of 5% in the cost of allowances and premium payments in 2012.  Because of the variances and complexities of allowances across the public service, Departments have been asked to forward information, including costs, in relation to each allowance and premium payment specific to their Department or sector, as appropriate. Where a Department considers that it is necessary to retain an allowance or a premium payment, as is or modified, it is necessary that a thorough and considered business case be submitted to inform the review.  Departments have been requested to forward the required information, and business cases, where relevant, before 31 January 2012; my Department intends to complete the review of business cases submitted shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">The Minister for Education and Skills announced, as part of Budget 2012, changes to the rules governing payment of qualification allowances to teachers pending completion of the public service-wide review of allowances.  He has indicated in that context that the position of existing teachers who, on 5 December 2011, were undertaking courses will be considered in the context of the public service-wide review of allowances.</p>

            <p eId="para_1821">The Government launched a new national internship scheme, JobBridge, on 1st  July last year.  JobBridge provides work experience for new entrants to the labour market after training or education, and to unemployed workers seeking to learn new skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">The scheme provides for up to 5,000 work experience placements in the private, public and voluntary sectors.  Participants must be signing on the Live Register for at least three months in order to apply.  The scheme comes under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton TD, and is overseen by a Steering Group which monitors the scheme on an on-going basis to ensure that it offers quality work experience to participants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">Over 3,500 interns had started their internships with host organisations up to 19th  January and a further 630 participants transferred to JobBridge from the Work Placement Programme.  A further 1,704 internship opportunities were available on the JobBridge website last week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">JobBridge has become firmly established as a popular internship scheme in the space of just six months and has attracted very strong interest from employers throughout the country.  While the current scheme is only open to those who are on the Live Register for three months or more, it is always open to companies to offer internships outside the parameters of JobBridge to those do not satisfy the qualifying criteria for the scheme.  In this context, and given the high rate of uptake to date on JobBridge, I see no value in establishing an alternative internship scheme supported by the Government.</p>

Modified rate contributions are not reckonable for establishing entitlement to state pension contributory.</p>

            <p eId="para_1864">In order to qualify for an internship, an individual must be in receipt of a live jobseekers claim and have been in receipt of jobseekers allowance or jobseekers benefit, or signing for credits, for a minimum of three of the previous six months. Time spent of certain government sponsored training may also be taken into account when calculating eligibility.  Providing they fulfil all Jobbridge eligibility criteria regarding jobseekers allowance/benefit, persons in part-time employment can participate in JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme provided that their employer is not the provider of the internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">A standard Internship working week will range from 30-40 hours per week. Therefore an intern will be required to participate on the scheme for a minimum of 30 hours and a maximum of 40 hours per week.  Hence, an additional requirement is that the part-time employment does not interfere with the minimum weekly hours (thirty) of the internship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">My Department continues to monitor and review the eligibility criteria for the JobBridge programme on an ongoing basis.  The Department of Social Protection has invited tenders for consultancy for an evaluation of JobBridge, National Internship Scheme for the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">The Department requires this Project to be undertaken to assess the design, delivery and impact of the JobBridge scheme on the unemployed.  It should also assist the Department in making further policy decisions on the benefit of work placement programmes in the overall context of the Government's activation policy which is to engage with every unemployed individual to provide them with a pathway to employment and to prevent and reduce long term unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">Individuals who are not in receipt of social welfare payments and are working part-time may also access the Work Placement Programme wherein there is a requirement to work 25 hours per week with a Host Organisation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1883">There are two back to work schemes available to assist people on certain social welfare payments who wish to become self-employed: namely the back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) and the short term enterprise allowance (STEA).</p>
            <p eId="para_1884">The BTWEA is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependent on certain social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, over two years: 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2. In the case of jobseekers, the qualifying period required for access to the BTWEA is 12 months, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to jobseeker's allowance. At the end of 2011, there were 10,751 participants on this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1885">The STEA provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for jobseekers' benefit wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to jobseeker's benefit. There were 1,294 people availing of this scheme on the 31st December 2011.  Under both schemes, the proposed business must be approved as viable and sustainable by an Integrated Development Company (Partnership) or a Department facilitator. Local social welfare offices also provide information and support services to people considering starting their own business. Details of all available schemes are on the Department's website <i>www.welfare.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_1890">Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory). Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than €356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%).</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">In this context it may be noted that self-employed workers generally achieve better value for money by paying social insurance compared to employees.  In terms of benefits the 2005 Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund found that the self-employed contributor can expect to receive over 10 times what he contributes to the social insurance fund compared to the employee who only gets 3 times what he and his employer contribute — despite the fact that the range of benefits available to employees is greater.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">Any changes to the PRSI system to extend the full range of social insurance benefits to self-employed persons would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered in the context of a much more significant rise in the rate of contribution payable. I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare last year to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government. The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">In addition, the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which is due to be completed in mid 2012 will, <i>inter alia</i>, examine this matter.</p>

The average time to award for the last quarter of 2011 is unavailable as, due to the phased introduction of a new claims processing system in the carer's allowance area, new claims are being processed on the new system while older claims are still being processed on the old system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1915">As mentioned above, a major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme. This involves the development of information technology functions and associated business process re-organisation. The first tranche of new carer's allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Accordingly, the project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department. This has had a short-term negative impact on claim processing times which is expected to continue until the completion of the modernisation project when all existing carer's allowance claims will be transferred onto the new processing system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1916">The most common reason for refusal is that the medical evidence supplied indicates that full time care is not required as laid down in Social Welfare legislation. Other common reasons for refusal include: full time care not being provided; means that exceed the limit for the scheme; and working or attending a training course for more than 15 hours per week.  It should be noted that a refusal may be made on more than one of these grounds.</p>

All scheme areas are subject to continuous business process improvement supported by modern technology.  Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.  The Department has already automated the State pension (contributory) scheme and most recently, as part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, the State pension (non-contributory) has been moved onto the new IT administration platform.  The new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to customers.</p>

All scheme areas are subject to continuous business process improvement supported by modern technology.  Claims are processed in the most efficient and expeditious way possible, having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply to each scheme.  The Department has already automated the State pension (contributory) scheme, thereby delivering an improved customer service. Most recently, as part of the Department's programme of service delivery modernisation, the State pension (non-contributory) has been moved onto the new IT administration platform.

In order to qualify for DCA, a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age.  This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time, so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living.  The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</p>

Effective debt recovery is seen an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming.  Debt holders should be aware that a Department of Social Protection debt will remain on their records until fully recovered.  This will result in a reduction of all future entitlements up to and including state pension.  Following the death of a customer who owes a debt, my Department has a claim on any estate remaining.  Persons who have a debt and who are no longer dependent on social welfare are required to repay this debt as quickly as possible.  My Department actively pursues the recovery of all overpayments including the initiation of civil proceedings where appropriate.  In the Fraud Initiative 2011-13 which I launched last September, there is a particular emphasis on enhancing the recovery of social welfare overpayments, while taking full account of social inclusion objectives.</p>

In addition, processing of applications on hand under this scheme has been slower than anticipated due to capacity constraints in undertaking this work.  As stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No 287 of 8 November 2011, the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO) forwarded the contract for the sale referred to by the Deputy to my Department for execution.  The contract was reviewed by officials of my Department and a small discrepancy was found.  My Department has contacted the CSSO with a view to resolving this discrepancy and closing the sale. Accordingly, I expect that the CSSO will be in contact with the applicant's solicitor shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2557">As the Deputy may be aware, the current TV licence system is such that, except for certain classes of social welfare recipients, if you own a television set in Ireland you are liable to pay a television licence.  An Post is currently responsible for the collection of television licence fees and for identifying those persons who have unlicensed televisions sets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2558">The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the TV licence into a household based Public Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content.  The issue of exemptions under any new Irish system is one which will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, the current list of exemptions is likely to continue to apply to pensioners and those people who are entitled to the Household Benefit Package.</p>

            <p eId="para_2560">The Barrow is one of 141 rivers assessed nationally each year to determine whether they can be a) opened for salmon fishing, b) opened to salmon fishing on a catch and release basis, or c) closed to salmon fishing.  These assessments show that it is substantially below its salmon conservation limit and stocks are being allowed to rebuild naturally in accordance with best international practise.  In that context, restocking does not take place in the Barrow as, on foot of scientific and management advice, reliance on natural selection and habitat improvement is the best way to assist wild stocks to improve.</p>
            <p eId="para_2561">Increased upstream escapement of adult fish to spawn in high quality freshwater spawning and nursery waters is the best and most sustainable means to secure the future of River Barrow salmon.  Over recent years, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) has also carried out an extensive catchment-wide electrofishing survey in the Barrow to assess juvenile salmon abundance.  A total of 84 sites were surveyed and salmon fry were present at 60 of these sites.  The mean value recorded over the period surveyed in the Barrow catchment confirms that the Barrow is below the threshold which would allow the opening of the Barrow for catch-and-release angling.</p>
            <p eId="para_2562">In 2012 another juvenile electrofishing survey of the Barrow is planned.  It is estimated that 32 field man days will be required to complete this survey.  While this represents a significant investment the work involved is mainstreamed into IFI activity.  Costs associated with the exercises undertaken on the rivers, including the Barrow, as part of the day to day functions of IFI personnel in the areas concerned, cannot be disaggregated from overall costs of IFI activities.  I can, however, advise the Deputy that the work involved on the Barrow will be supported by additional expenditure of some €5,000 in 2012, which covers support expenditure for field staff and contract personnel from UCC, over and above the element of day to day functional costs.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Pat Rabbitte)</from>
            <p eId="para_2564">The Programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the TV licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the TV licence into a household based Public Broadcasting Charge to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content.</p>
            <p eId="para_2565">In line with this commitment, my Department is currently examining both the effectiveness and efficiency of the existing model of television licence fee collection in the context of the changing technological environment.  It is also examining the applicability to the situation in Ireland of various international models for the funding of public service broadcasting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2566">Although subject to a degree of evasion, the existing TV licence fee system has provided a stable funding base for our public service broadcasters.  The rationale for providing State funding for public service broadcasting is to provide an independent and reliable income flow that allows these corporations to attain their public service objects while ensuring they can maintain editorial independence.  This is especially important in the context of news and current affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2567">The overall aim of Public Service Broadcasting is to provide services and content which cater for all interests in society, while ensuring that the varied elements of Irish culture and its intrinsic values are protected.  Through the obligations placed on the Public Service Broadcasters and the criteria set for the funding of content through the Sound and Vision Scheme, the production of quality indigenous programming and the production of minority interests can be assured.</p>
            <p eId="para_2568">Whatever the system of funding, the rationale for providing funding will continue to apply and any changes that may be implemented on foot of the review must continue to provide a secure funding base for public service broadcasting and content, whilst also recognising the reality of new mechanisms to access such content and its pervasiveness in today's society.  The principle underlying the proposal for the introduction of a Public Broadcasting Charge on eligible households and applicable businesses is that publicly-funded public service broadcasting is a public good and, as such, is of benefit to society in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_2569">Publicly-funded public service broadcasting and content are now available to everyone on an ever-increasing range of platforms and devices (radio, television, smart phone, pc, laptop and many other devices) and, in fact, access is not dependent on the ownership of a device.  In short, everyone benefits from the availability of these services, regardless of how content is accessed or relayed to the public, and, therefore, it is my view that the cost should be borne by society as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_2570">All households and businesses will be subject to the charge, except for those that are specifically exempted.  The issue of exemptions under any new Irish system is one which will have to be given detailed consideration when the type of model to be developed is agreed.  That said, it is my expectation that the current exemptions in relation to pensioners and those entitled to the Household Benefit Package will continue to apply.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Phil Hogan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2584">Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) classifies items such as bottles, drink cans and containers as packaging.  The Packaging Directive is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">Under the Directive, Ireland's requirement to achieve a 60% recovery rate for packaging waste in 2011 had already been exceeded by 2009, when a recovery rate of 70% was achieved. The material-specific recycling targets of 60% for glass and 50% for metals had also been achieved by 2009, with recycling rates of 76% and 50%, respectively, recorded.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to drive a waste reduction programme as part of the overall approach to sustainable waste management.  A levy on packaging is one of the possible elements of this waste reduction strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2586">A period of initial public consultation on a possible levy on packaging concluded in August 2011. The main issues examined in this consultation included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2587">The overall views of stakeholders on a packaging levy;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2588">How a packaging levy might operate;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2589">International experiences of similar levies; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2590">How a possible packaging levy might be structured to best contribute to a reduction in packaging waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_2591">Following on from this consultation, I intend to commence a full review of the Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model in Ireland in 2012, which will include a review of the packaging recovery and recycling system. The packaging analysis will build on the initial levy consultation and will examine other relevant issues in the packaging arena, such as deposit and refund. The final report will make recommendations for changes to PRI policy, which will ensure that Ireland is in a position to meet more challenging waste recovery and recycling targets in the future in the most cost-effective manner possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2632">I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 to 146, inclusive, and 156 to 165, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2633">As part of the process of preparing the National Housing Development Survey 2011, launched by my Department in October 2011, local authorities provided details of all unfinished housing developments in their areas. Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2634">Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2635">Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2636">Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2637">Category four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_2638">Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorization process include, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2639">the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting facilities, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2640">the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2641">the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2642">the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2643">the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned and</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2644">where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.</p>
            <p eId="para_2645">This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2646">The relevant planning reference of each development is utilised for purposes of my Department's analysis of such developments, and for reference in regard to the ongoing work being carried out by my Department and the local authority sector on the issues facing their residents. Any households resident in an unfinished development prescribed as an unfinished housing estate for the purposes of the Act are covered by the waiver.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge. This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 and forms the complete and final list of such developments for this year. A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end. Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease significantly as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.</p>

In addition, homeowners can make payment by cheque, postal order, credit/debit card or in four instalments by direct debit by completing the relevant payment details on the declaration form and posting it to Household Charge, PO Box 12168, Dublin 1.  Instalment payments are available by direct debit only and persons opting to pay in this way must register their details by 1 March, 2012.  </p>
            <p eId="para_2650">A bureau is in place in the LGMA to administer the charge on a shared service/agency basis for all local authorities.

I am satisfied that there is a comprehensive suite of payment options available to persons with a liability to pay the household charge.</p>

In that context, I intend to consider further the concept of a directly elected mayor and its relationship with the local government system.</p>

            <p eId="para_2842">Under section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, an unmarried father of a child, whether or not he is a guardian of the child, may apply to the court for an order giving directions on any question affecting the welfare of the child including the question of access to the child.  In making such orders the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2843">Where appropriate and practicable, the Court in making any order takes into account the child's wishes in the matter having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  In considering whether to make an order under section 11, the court, further to section 11D (as inserted in the Act of 1964 by the Children Act 1997) must have regard to whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both his or her father and mother on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2844">The Act of 1964 (again by way of amendments in the Children Act 1997) encourages parties to a dispute in relation to a child to agree on the custody or guardianship of or access to a child.  Prior to institution of proceedings the legal representatives of the parties must discuss with them the possibility of agreement.  The Court may adjourn any proceedings to assist agreement between the parties.  These legislative provisions are extensive. They permit the court in cases of disagreement to decide on arrangements for the child's care and upbringing having regard to the child's best interests.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)</from>
            <p eId="para_2852">I propose to take Questions Nos. 168 to 174, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2853">The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was jointly established following an agreement of August 1997 between the Irish and British Governments to supervise the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons and explosive materials.  The Commission was dissolved by Orders made by both Governments on 30 March 2011.  Between those dates the Commission successfully decommissioned virtually all the weapons and explosive materials which had been in the hands of paramilitary groups in this island.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">There is no doubting that the Commission's work was central to the peace process and I am sure the House will join me in recording our appreciation of that work.  As an independent body the Commission decided the arrangements for the holding of its archive independently.  I am advised that the Commission did consult with both Governments and the issue of lodging the archive in Boston College had been pursued since July 2010.  The Commission's final report, submitted to the Government on 28 March 2011, detailed the arrangements which it had made for the storage of its documentation, including the most sensitive documentation relating to the inventory of decommissioned material.  That sensitive material is not in the archive in Boston College.  The remaining material which is of a more general nature was deposited with Boston College, subject to conditions including an embargo on their disclosure for a period of 30 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">To suggest that disposition of the archive was a matter within the power of the Irish Government is based on a fundamental misunderstanding.  As the Commission was a body jointly established by the Irish and British Governments the holding of the archive by the one or the other jurisdiction would not have been possible, given the independent nature of the Commission and the nature of the archive.  Accordingly, I understand the question of consultation of the kind referred to by the Deputy did not arise though, of course, this would have been a matter for the administration in office when this matter was being resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">The Commission itself made the arrangements to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of its archive in the public interest and in the interests of the peace process.  The Deputy will understand that consultations on the final disposition of the Commission's archive were completed before I became Minister.  Indeed the first I learned of the arrangements, which the Commission had put in place, was when the Commission detailed them in its final Report of 28 March 2011.  I would emphasise that I have no issue with the approach which the Commission took to dealing with its archive, having consulted the then Governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2857">I am, of course, aware of legal proceedings in the United States to which the Deputy refers concerning entirely separate documentation held in Boston College.  I am advised that the material which the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning deposited with Boston College is of a general nature and does not contain sensitive information in relation to individuals.  Furthermore, the order dissolving the Commission contains a number of provisions including one which declares the archives to be inviolable until 2041.</p>
            <p eId="para_2858">In addition the equivalent UK order also confers this inviolability and accords them the status of diplomatic documentation under the Vienna Convention and acknowledges that the documentation can only be accessed prior to 2041 with the agreement of the Irish Government. The fact that the documentation has been given diplomatic status under the Convention means that it cannot be properly accessed by any third party. They are, therefore, in an entirely different category to the material which is the subject of the legal proceedings referred to.  There are no grounds for believing that the Commission's material could be subject to requests for disclosure of the kind which arise in the case referred to by the Deputy.  In the circumstances, the question of my contacting Boston College in the light of those completely separate proceedings does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2859">Officials in my Department and in the Northern Ireland Office have been monitoring developments and will remain in contact about the matter.  However, I have no reason to believe that there are grounds for concern about the arrangements made by the Commission arising from the entirely separate case referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2865">This processing time can, nevertheless, be affected by seasonal fluctuations or the necessity to seek further information on particular applications which may result in the processing time exceeding the present average of 2 weeks.  Since I became Minister I have taken a number of measures to ensure that the time it takes for the processing of vetting applications has improved significantly.

            <p eId="para_2870">The person concerned is a failed asylum applicant. Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 7th April, 2009, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2871">The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and, following consideration of this application, it was determined that he was not eligible for Subsidiary Protection. The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 30th May, 2011.  The case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will now be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  The Deputy should note that as the person concerned has not established a right of legal residency in the State, the issue of an application for citizenship does not arise at this time.</p>

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  On 9th August, 2007, the person concerned made an application for residency in the State on the basis of being the spouse of an EU National. However, following consideration of this application, under the provisions of the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations, a decision was made to refuse that application.  The person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 30th September, 2008.  This decision was upheld following an internal review of the application.</p>

When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.

All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.

Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the first named person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2885">The second named person concerned arrived in the State in June, 2006, accompanied by her infant child, and applied for asylum. This child was included in his mother's asylum application, as was another child who was born in the State later that year. The asylum application was refused following consideration of the case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2886">Arising from the refusal of her asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the second named person concerned was notified, by letter dated 18th April, 2007, that the then Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her children She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of making representations to the Minister setting out reasons why they should not have Deportation Orders made against them.

            <p eId="para_2887">The second named person concerned lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The second named person concerned was notified of this decision by letter dated 25th September, 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2888">The case of the second named person concerned was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted by and on behalf of the second named person concerned. On 12th November 2008, the then Minister made Deportation Orders in respect of the second named person concerned and her two children. These Orders were served by registered post which placed a legal obligation on the persons concerned to ‘present' at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) in order to make arrangements for their removal from the State. The Deportation Orders remain in place. The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the second named person concerned and her children must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. The Deputy will appreciate that once a Deportation Order has been served, the enforcement of such an Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.</p>
            <p eId="para_2889">I am satisfied that the individual asylum applications made by the persons concerned were fairly and comprehensively examined under all the relevant headings before decisions to refuse them were taken. The Deputy should also note that copies of the determinations made in their individual cases were given to the persons concerned so it will have been made clear to them as to the reasoning behind the determinations made.</p>

            <p eId="para_2965">The moratorium on recruitment was introduced in late March 2009 and was incorporated into the Employment Control Framework (ECF) for the health sector for 2009.  The ECF provided an exemption for a number of grades which had been prioritised by Government.  The Framework also provides for the filling of exceptional posts in order to protect frontline services in so far as possible while still achieving the required reduction in staff numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2966">In 2009, responsibility for the approval of these exceptions to the moratorium required the prior approval, in each case, of the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance. In 2010 the rules of the ECF were revised to allow the HSE to manage the ‘exceptions' provisions without recourse to the Departments referred to.  The posts approved in 2009 are set out in the table:</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#DrJamesReilly" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_755">
            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy James Reilly)</from>
            <p eId="para_3306">I am concerned that private health insurance is becoming harder to afford, especially for older people, as insurers increasingly tailor their insurance plans towards younger, healthier customers. Under Universal Health Insurance, everyone will be insured for health care and the current unfair discrimination between public and private patients will be removed. In the meantime, I am focusing on addressing the problems of the current private health insurance market, where insurers have a considerable financial incentive to cover younger, better risks rather than older, poorer risks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3307">I am strongly committed to protecting community rating, whereby older and less healthy customers should pay the same amount for the same cover as younger and healthier people.  In order to protect community rating, we need a system of Risk Equalisation which ensures that community rating can survive. At present, we have an Interim Scheme, which has been in place since 2009. It is designed to compensate insurers which have older, less healthy customers and therefore higher claims costs, compared to insurers which have younger, less costly customers. It does so by a system of tax credits, based on age, in respect of persons of 60 years and over.  Without such a system, community rating cannot survive. The Interim Scheme is funded by a Community Rating Levy, in respect of every health insurance policy written. I extended the Interim Scheme for a further year in 2012 under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, and will introduce a more detailed Risk Equalisation scheme under new legislation from next January.</p>
            <p eId="para_3308">In order to keep down the cost of health insurance for older people, I increased significantly the age-related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 years and over, from 1 January 2012. Without this support, health insurers would have had an even stronger financial incentive to ‘segment' the market by offering policies targeted at young people, to the disadvantage of older customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">I must emphasise that these measures are designed to result in no overall increase of premiums in the market and to spread the risk more evenly between the healthy and the less healthy, the young and the old. The increased levy is balanced by a corresponding increase in tax credits for older people, so that the system is Exchequer neutral overall. In this regard, it is important to note that the levy on policies is not a revenue collecting mechanism for the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_3310">The Community Rating Levy, under the Interim Scheme, is placed on private health insurance providers for each insured individual, and not on the individuals themselves. It is a matter for the insurance providers as to the extent, if any, they pass the levy on to their clients.  I welcome the announcements by Aviva Healthcare and the VHI that they do not envisage passing an increase on to customers' premiums on foot of the revised rates of Age-Related Tax Credit and Community Rating Levy for 2012. I am disappointed that Quinn Healthcare have chosen to increase their premium costs, blaming the revised rates I have recently introduced under the Interim Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3311">In December 2011, I agreed with the three commercial health insurers to establish a Consultative Forum to tackle issues of mutual concern. We agreed to work cooperatively in driving down costs related to health insurance and to identify savings that could be achieved by both public and private hospitals. I indicated to the insurers that I would be happy to hear proposals from them which would result in lower costs for the health insurance sector. A new review of the VHI's claims costs will be carried out to establish what further savings can be made.  The review is be completed early this year and will contribute significantly to more effective cost control within the private health insurance market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3312">I am determined that these and other measures will have a significant impact in containing the level of any future increases in health insurance premiums. The Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain competitive as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance.</p>

            <p eId="para_3323">I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 212 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3324">The Health and Social Care Professionals Council was established in March 2007 to implement the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.  The Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for twelve health and social care professions including podiatrists.  It will apply to the designated professions regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed.  It is the first time that fitness to practice procedures will be put in place for these professionals on a statutory basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3325">The first registration board to be established under the Council, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established in August 2010 and the Radiographers Registration Board was established in December 2011.  At least four additional registration boards are scheduled for establishment in 2012, with subsequent registration boards to be established as soon as possible after that.  With regard to the regulation of podiatrists and the establishment of their registration board, it is not envisaged that a registration board for this profession will be established in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">The Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) Regulations 2003 place strict controls on the prescribing, supply and administration of medicines, for the purpose of patient protection.  In order to create an entitlement for a health profession to supply or administer prescription medicines to patients, it is first necessary for that profession to be subject to a statutory regulatory regime which includes fitness to practice and disciplinary sanctions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">While I am open to making medicines more accessible to patients where safe and appropriate to do so, including permitting the use of medicines by health professions such as podiatrists, statutory registration of podiatrists is a prerequisite to any legislation which would permit a podiatrist to supply and administer prescription medicines to patients.  I am aware of developments in the United Kingdom where there is a consultation process underway regarding prescribing rights of podiatrists.  However I would point out that podiatrists in the United Kingdom have been subject to a statutory registration system for many years.</p>

            <p eId="para_3351">Minimum benefit is one of the key principles on which the Irish private health insurance regulatory system is based. Minimum Benefit Regulations, made under the Health Insurance Acts, require insurers to offer a minimum benefit to every insured person. The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. Minimum Benefit Regulations help to ensure that consumers obtain a minimum level of health insurance cover regardless of what plan they purchase. Minimum Benefit Regulations were introduced in 1996, under Section 10 of the Health Insurance Act 1994. The Regulations cover in-patient, out-patient and day-patient services provided by publicly funded hospitals, private hospitals, registered nursing home and hospital consultants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3352">At present, the minimum benefits cover access to a semi-private room in a public hospital, including in-patient consultant fees, and cover a wide range of acute treatments, and this represents the minimum level of cover that must be offered to every insured person.  The current regulations will be examined as part of the overall strategy to address issues in the private health insurance market, leading in to the introduction of Universal Health Insurance.</p>

            <p eId="para_3354">The Government has determined that, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced to approximately 102,000 in 2012.  The most recent HSE data indicates that, over the two-month period to end-February 2012, some 2,100 health service staff will retire from the health service.  Of this figure approximately 1,000 are nurses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3355">The cumulative impact of staff reductions from this year and previous years represents a significant challenge for the health system in delivering services. The priority is to reform how health services are delivered in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.  The HSE National Service Plan includes a commitment to addressing necessary reforms within the context of the Public Service Agreement.  It also commits the HSE to minimising the impact on services by fast-tracking new, innovative and more efficient ways of using reduced resources, including greater flexibilities in work practices and rosters (especially of nursing and medical staff).</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">Given the need to maintain the quality of patient care, I have asked the HSE to submit, as a matter of urgency, its assessment of the likely impact of retirements to the end of February, to identify particular pressure points and to develop appropriate measures to deal with significant departures in a given service or area.  I also intend to review the Service Plan once the full impact of the staff leaving at the end of the 29 February "grace period" is known.</p>

            <p eId="para_3358">Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care where this is appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3359">While the Minister and this Government continues to reiterate our commitment to the future public provision of residential care for older people we must recognise that the HSE is facing challenges in respect of all services in 2012.  In the case of Community Nursing Units these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age and structure of its units.  It is clear that on a business as usual basis, the HSE would have to close further beds across a range of public community nursing units in 2012.  In the absence of reform, this would increase the cost of caring for older persons within the public system, undermine the viability of public community nursing units and reduce the overall number of older persons that can be supported within the budget available for Fair Deal. This is not a sustainable way forward and would not meet the needs of older persons, local communities, the taxpayer or those working in the public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3360">Instead, we need a more pro-active approach to the provision of community nursing home units which seeks to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available, including smaller units where challenges of scale may require more innovative approaches to service delivery.  This is likely to require a combination of actions such as consolidation of services, and changes in staffing, skill mix and work practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3361">Consideration must be given to the different types of services required — such as long-stay and transitional — and the respective strengths of public and private community nursing units in that regard; the public and private capacity available within an area; the age and structure of public units; and the wider needs of the local community.  Alternative options for providing a viable community nursing service including a possible role for local communities or other voluntary providers also need to be explored. The HSE is already examining issues in this regard and will be working closely with the Department to develop an overall set of proposals for the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_3387">The current expenditure for regional and local roads will be reduced significantly over the next few years in light of the current difficult economic climate.  Reductions of the magnitude proposed necessitated that some very good and worthwhile projects be curtailed.  In making adjustments to the regional and local roads budget the primary aim has been,  as far as is possible, to protect previous investment in the road network and use the  available funding to maintain and restore public roads, including those in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3388">To that end, it was necessary to discontinue grants under the Local Improvements Scheme achieving a saving of €5 million.  While the importance of this scheme to rural communities and in assisting local development projects on non-public accommodation roads is acknowledged, the maintenance and improvement of these roads is, in the first instance a matter for the relevant landowner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3389">Given that the priority in using scarce resources in the current difficult economic climate is to maintain public roads it is not possible to assist with any works on non-public roads and therefore this scheme has been suspended.

            <p eId="para_3442">In accordance with SI No. 771 of 2004, section 6, Local Authorities are currently responsible for appointing authorised testers for commercial vehicle testing (commercial vehicle test centres).  Therefore, it is a matter for the Local Authority to decide where commercial vehicle test centres are located in their area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3443">The Road Safety Authority (RSA) is currently engaged in the implementation of a wide-ranging Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness (CVR) reform programme. This reform programme will drive a "step change" in the roadworthiness standards of commercial vehicles operating on Ireland's roads. The programme will have 3 strands and will include a reform of the roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles (including buses), increased roadside roadworthiness enforcement and operator maintenance systems compliance checks that are aimed at developing a much greater awareness of road safety issues amongst commercial vehicle operators and drivers.  It is envisaged that the RSA will take over responsibility for licensing and supervising commercial vehicle testing in the near future when the required legislative provisions are in place.</p>
