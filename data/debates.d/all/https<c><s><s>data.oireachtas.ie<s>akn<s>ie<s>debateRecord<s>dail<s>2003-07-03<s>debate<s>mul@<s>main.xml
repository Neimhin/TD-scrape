          <p eId="para_15">Is there a report from the committee concerning No. 15, the proposal for a Council regulation to amend the Sirene manual? The practice of linking items to be taken without debate is a bad one because it regularly forces the Opposition to vote against something its members think should be taken without debate if it is linked with something that should not be.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">I also object to the taking of this item without an indication of the extent of scrutiny, the views or the conclusions of the committee. We are entitled to a report with recommendations as appropriate. The absence of that makes a mockery of the process because we are being asked to rubber-stamp an EU regulation to amend the supplementary information request at the national entries – Sirene – manual, which has far-reaching implications and has already earned the express concern of credible human rights voices. There are very important matters at the core of this proposition which are not known to the Members of this House, who are being asked—</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I propose an amendment to this proposal, "That the Dáil shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 8 July 2003". Given the publication yesterday of the public finance figures, the number of job losses in recent weeks, and the number of Bills and reports that have not been discussed either by the Dáil or its committees, the Dáil should not adjourn today until the end of September. We should adjourn until next Tuesday and come back to decide on an agenda to discuss these outstanding issues that are of importance. I suppose the Minister for Agriculture and Food is thinking fondly of going to Mexico in September.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_52">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_55">I have a somewhat different amendment but with the same purpose as that of Deputy Kenny. I am persuaded that the credibility of the House will continue to suffer as long as we do not order our business in a manner that is more commensurate with modern times and the workload with which the House has to deal. If one looks at the legislative record of this Dáil so far, only five of the 19 Bills promised for this session have been published. Some 12 Bills have been guillotined this week alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Some media representatives, mainly those who never set foot in Leinster House and have no idea of what goes on here, comment adversely on the work of the Houses of the Oireachtas, no matter what we do. No matter what changes we have made to reform the institution, including the number of committees instituted which have a heavy workload, the fact is that formal sittings of the Dáil are still more reminiscent of the days when gentlemen wandered in from the Bar Library at the end of the day and gentleman farmers made up the Opposition side of the House. It is not acceptable. One will never see the same commentators remarking that we were here until after 11 o'clock last night and that that has been the pattern in recent weeks. That does not detract from the fact that the formal ordering of Dáil business, including the minimal number of sitting days, the duration of the summer recess and the unnecessary taking of additional weeks on the pretext of St. Patrick's Day and Easter, is damaging the credibility of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Given the urgent matters that have come into the public domain recently, there is absolutely no reason, as Deputy Kenny has suggested, we cannot convene next Tuesday as usual. I propose to delete "30 September 2003" and substitute "9 September 2003". There is no reason the House should not be willing and able to reconvene on that date to deal with urgent matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">I do not believe there is any conviction on the Government side about the necessity to maintain the reputation of Parliament. The reputation of this House has been diminished in recent years for a variety of reasons, but the least defensible one is the fact that we are not prepared to adapt to modern times and do our business like other parliaments. Our workload is such that parliamentary party meetings cannot take place because of the pressure on Members to attend different committees that are in session at the same time. Our meetings have been disrupted four or five times in the last two or three weeks and I am sure the experience has been the same for colleagues on both sides of the House. We need to examine these matters, otherwise talk about Dáil reform will not cut any ice with the public. For that reason, a Cheann Comhairle, after you deal with Deputy Kenny's amendment, I will be proposing this amendment on behalf of the Labour Party.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_53">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_59">The Green Party also opposes this proposal. We can see no reason the House cannot  continue to meet for a number of weeks, or why the recess should be of such a long duration. It is worth noting that yesterday was the 100th sitting day of the 29th Dáil, which works out at an average of one and a half days per week since the general election last year. The time spent in session contrasts badly with the expectations of the many people who elected us to this Chamber. Much of the legislation we are passing is being dealt with spasmodically. Some 12 Bills are being guillotined this week, which is the equivalent of the number of Bills we passed last autumn. That type of workload undermines the credibility of everyone in the House. We propose that the House should continue to sit for a number of additional weeks before adjourning until 2 September.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The Dáil's schedule of sitting days compares very badly with other parliaments in Europe and elsewhere. We are among the worst, if not the worst parliament, in terms of attendance and processing legislation.</p>

We could address many issues and I have no doubt Government backbenchers will acknowledge that, over the past number of weeks, the way business has been dealt with in terms of guillotining and cramming in legislation within a short period has hindered the proper scrutiny and engagement we should employ in the Chamber. Two Bills are coming up, which will be  both guillotined within a half an hour of each other. That is not the way to do business. I would prefer to sit for a greater part of the year to give ourselves the time to perform the roles and responsibilities that have been entrusted to us. We should continue next week and it is interesting that many Members will be present because committees are sitting. I commend that proposition to the Tánaiste.

          <p eId="para_103">Before we move on with the Order of Business, a Cheann Comhairle, I take this opportunity to thank you, the Clerk of the Dáil and all the staff for their hard work and enormous assistance they have given to all Members of the House during the past session. I also acknowledge the hard work of the staff in the Whip's office and the staff attached to the other parties. I hope they get an opportunity to have some rest and a period of reflection over the summer recess.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_104">I join the Tánaiste in complimenting you, a Cheann Comhairle, your office and the staff of the House generally for the manner in which business has been conducted. I proposed that the House should sit next Tuesday and that we should come back earlier than 30 September and I really mean that. I join with Deputy Rabbitte in saying that as we have gone through the benchmarking process and are recipients of its outcome, we should lead by example. I would have expected that the Chief Whip to introduce a realistic package of more effective Dáil reform in order that we could present ourselves as a Parliament that really works in the people's interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Given the economic uncertainty that exists, threatened closures and job losses and the pressure on people in their daily lives, be it in terms of health, crime, child care or whatever, it is difficult to be part of an Oireachtas that is breaking up for three months. I join with the Tánaiste's extension of good wishes to the staff of the House for working under pressure for very long hours and delivering the effective service they provide while we are here. My intention is that we should actually be here for a longer period.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">There is a great deal of uncertainty, anger and frustration in the country, and the Oireachtas has failed to address people's concerns. People feel there is not really anybody in charge on the Government benches and that we are running around in a confused haze. If the Government parties meet over the next three or four weeks outside the influence of the House, perhaps their members would inveigle the Chief Whip to introduce a list of really effective Dáil reform that would make this Parliament vibrant, responsive and alive and enable it to deal with the issues concerning people.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_107">I join the Tánaiste and Deputy Kenny in thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, and your office for your helpfulness and courtesy over the year, and in complimenting the staff of the Oireachtas who are directly concerned with making the House function efficiently throughout the year. I do not think everybody appreciates the hours required of staff when the House is in normal session.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">I do not want to engage at this stage in more serious comment, except in terms of the Bill the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has published on inquiries into matters of public interest. It is regrettable that the Government has not come forward with legislation or even promised legislation, following on the Abbeylara judgment, that would enable inquiry by parliamentary committee to be resumed on the DIRT inquiry model. I am not suggesting that would be suitable in every case but it certainly would be a cheaper, faster and more efficient option in certain circumstances. I ask the Tánaiste to have this matter examined during the recess. It was shown in the DIRT case that such business can be done  by Members of the House and can enhance the standing of the House in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">I accept what the Tánaiste says about the role of Members when the Dáil is not formally in session. Having seen the finances yesterday, I do not envy the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, or other spending Ministers in the Estimates conflict that will take place for the rest of July. I wish them well and hope they come out of it unscathed before the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Other than that, as a former nemesis of the Tánaiste used to say, the beaches of Kerry beckon in August. Personally, I am looking forward to seeing the Taoiseach more frequently during August than I have seen him since Christmas. While I am on my feet, I extend a word of thanks to those in the press gallery for their work over the year, even if I do not always agree with them all of the time.</p>

I join the Tánaiste in thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the staff of your office for facilitating the business of this House over the past session, and indeed all of the staff of Leinster House, whose personal and family lives are affected by the manic way in which we order business. Hopefully, when we return we will give serious consideration as to how that business might be better ordered.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">All of us are looking forward to the opportunity of reacquainting ourselves with our own families and many of our constituents. Hopefully, we will come back refreshed in the autumn and have the opportunity of keeping the Government on track in a way that, at times, it does seem to be able to do itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I join with colleagues in extending good wishes to you and your staff, a Cheann Comhairle, for the summer recess, and indeed to all of the staff in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I have no doubt as to the Tánaiste's sincerity in extending those warm wishes. We will shortly deal with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002 and I appeal to the Tánaiste, on the back of her comments, to translate this warmth into the acceptance of the proposal to allow for worker representation on the commission that will hopefully be in place in the near future regarding the workings of these Houses. The absence of worker representation is a major issue for the 500-plus non-elected people who regard this as their daily workplace, just as we elected representatives do.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I extend good wishes to my own colleagues, to all of the other Opposition Deputies and to the Government Ministers and backbenchers for the summer period. I hope that the period of reflection the Tánaiste spoke about will be employed by the Government Ministers and backbenchers  and that on our return in the autumn, they will have seen their way to accepting that they have no monopoly on wisdom in terms of the course of legislation and the interests of the wider populace. The Opposition presented much to the Government that was worth taking on board and embracing, but regrettably, many good ideas and sound amendments have been rejected purely because of their authorship. That is a significant failing, and I look forward to a more productive session on the commencement of business at the end of September.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I thank my parliamentary party colleagues in this House for their co-operation during the year.

Considering the appalling nature of the report which went so far as to ask for the closure of two prisons, Mountjoy and Portlaoise, and described some terrible conditions in them, is it intended that the Office of the Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention will be put on an independent statutory basis so that we can get an independent inspection and assessment of what is really going on in our prisons?</p>

          <p eId="para_180">The basis of my approach to this Bill is that it should be coming before this Dáil as a public Bill. I base that assertion on the Standing Order for private Bills which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Every Bill promoted for the particular interest or benefit of any person or locality as distinguished from a measure of public policy shall be treated as a Private Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I acknowledge that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is an excellent educational institution which trains professionals to a very high standard, which has deservedly been recognised worldwide. However, I have a number of serious questions regarding this Bill and its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I outlined these to Mr. Kevin O'Malley, a representative of the RCSI, when I had the opportunity to meet him recently, an opportunity I acknowledge today.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I question the college's charitable status and its corporate activities. Most of all, I challenge the lack of public accountability of this institution, which is subsidised to the tune of perhaps many millions of euro annually in tax breaks by this State. We have a totally anomalous situation whereby the National University of Ireland is a public body subject to the scrutiny of the Houses of the Oireachtas, while the RCSI medical school, which under the 1977 agreement, is a recognised college of the NUI, is not subject to the same accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The activities of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland are clearly a matter of public policy. That is the essence of my argument. Its activities must concern this Dáil. The RCSI is a key institution in both our education and health systems and it plays a central role in the education of medical professionals. It has an important role in the deployment of personnel into the hospital system. This is because the college controls – and this is critically important – the in-hospital train ing regime of trainee surgeons. I have made the point privately and publicly that the withdrawal by the RCSI of training recognition has a hugely negative impact, not only on the hospitals but on the wider community it serves. It means the withdrawal of junior hospital doctors and the consequent loss of services in terms of decisions taken by the college.</p>

In the absence of such specialists, we have a situation where accident and emergency units are closing. I must ask whether the college examines the real effects of its decision.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">I have tabled these amendments to highlight what I regard as the anomaly regarding the charitable status of the RCSI. This status allows it to avoid stamp duties, corporation tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, while corporate and personal donations to the college are tax-deductible. If the RCSI were legally a corporation rather than a charity, it would have incurred stamp duty of €4.5 million on its purchase of the Ardilaun Centre on St. Stephen's Green. The college agreed at the time to pay Green Properties €75 million for the Ardilaun Centre in December – just before the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, raised the stamp duty to 9%. The stamp duty that applied prior to that was 6%.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">I could go further into detail regarding the college's extensive properties in this city. It just so happens that this is the first raft of amendments in the very limited time open to me. Suffice to say that the Revenue Commissioners are on public record as saying they are not aware of any other charitable trust in Ireland that owns a property development company. These amendments therefore focus on that aspect of the college's activities, and what value or return the taxpayer receives for granting such concessions to a major property developer. This is one of the questions I ask of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, although I understand he is also curtailed in terms of the responses he may be able to make. We shall see.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">These amendments are my only means of addressing this issue, and I commend them to the House.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_204">In the short time available, the only opportunity any of us will have to address the issue will be by way of the amendments tabled by Deputy Ó Caoláin.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">I do not think these particular amendments are appropriate in terms of what Deputy Ó Caoláin is trying to achieve. He may well have a very good argument for bringing the RCSI under more public scrutiny and more into the public system of third level education. The financial issues the Deputy raised are genuine, but I do not think they are appropriate on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">It is also a pity that Deputy Ó Caoláin could not participate in the Committee Stage debate in the Joint Committee on the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (Charter Amendment) Bill 2002. Neither did the Labour Party have a right to be on that committee, due to the numbers situation, with only three representatives from the Dáil and  three from the Seanad. The Joint Committee on Standing Orders [Private Business], should examine this for the future due to the diverse nature of representation in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The Labour Party and I wanted to table amendments, so I sought a position on that committee and my request was granted. I was able to put forward amendments which were accepted on Committee Stage, and my party was able to contribute to and strengthen the Bill. It is certainly difficult for smaller groupings within the Oireachtas to have a say in private Bills, and that point needs to be addressed in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I do not see why it is not possible for Deputy Ó Caoláin and his party to propose a public Bill if they so wish, on this issue, but I do not think these amendments will address the core issues Deputy Ó Caoláin raises. We should support the Bill in its current form in regard to its proposals for a college set up under charter over 200 years ago, which charter has been amended at various times in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">There are serious points to be made. The issue of the training regime is obviously a serious one in various parts of the country. That needs to be addressed, but in a different way.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I welcome the fact that the amendments I proposed on Committee Stage have been incorporated into the Bill, which is now better. However, there are issues that need to be addressed at another forum. On behalf of my party, I will be taking up the issue of the membership of the committee directly. All sections of the Oireachtas should have an opportunity to participate at the appropriate stage on Private Bills.</p>

          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_211">I support the Bill. I understand Deputy Ó Caoláin's frustration at the way the system works and the fact that his party was not represented on the committee that discussed the Bill. That committee gave us the opportunity to tease out the issues and put questions to representatives of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and their legal counsel, who were present that day. This process left those of us on the committee in the position of being happy with the Bill and we were able to accept its contents.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">For various reasons, individual hospitals throughout the country are in considerable difficulty. Much of the responsibility for this lies with the Department of Health and Children rather than with any educational institution. However, without the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the provision of medical personnel here would be far worse. In the past year, the college has been extremely progressive in offering new courses in specialised areas where we have an extreme shortage of people in a position to provide the necessary services.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">I do not have difficulty with the Bill amending the charters or letters patent that existed previously. I support Deputy O'Sullivan's comments about the Standing Orders, which date back to 1939, although amendments have been made to  them. It is time to look at Standing Orders on this matter and in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">It is important to realise what we are doing here today. We are dealing with private business, not public business. This is a Private Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Deputy Ó Caoláin raised a number of matters of legitimate public discussion, but they are not apposite to a discussion on a Private Bill. The Bill is here because in order to amend its charters, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland must promote a Private Bill through the House. Not every body is obliged to do so. If, as is the case with most corporate bodies, a body is incorporated under the companies legislation, procedures are available under that legislation whereby it can amend its own articles of memorandum and association by resolution of the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">In the case of bodies formed under charters or letters patent from the Crown in former times, however, it is necessary to promote a Private Bill, which imposes a substantial expense on such bodies. From the terms of this legislation, I note that the college has had to retain solicitors as agents to act on its behalf and instructed counsel at an earlier stage of the Bill. The consideration of a Private Bill should always be influenced by the fact that the body in question, to amend its own constitution, cannot do so itself but is obliged to come to the House to do so. That is the purpose of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Oireachtas has full power to legislate on matters by way of public Act and the Private Bill procedure does not take away from that in any way. The Oireachtas has the sole and exclusive right to pass laws for the State. If Deputy Ó Caoláin has concerns along the lines he suggests, it is open to him to initiate legislation by way of Acts of the Oireachtas to deal with those concerns. I would be concerned if the Private Bill procedure were used to ventilate matters of that sort when it has a clearly defined purpose under the Standing Orders. I assume that is why Standing Orders provide for a very limited membership on committees to consider these Bills. The House must act judicially in considering a matter of this nature. We are looking at an application by a body corporate to change its own constitution where that body corporate has so determined that these changes are desirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Deputy Ó Caoláin raised the question of charitable status, which is a general matter of law. Various purposes are viewed as charitable, one of which is education. All educational bodies benefit from the concept of charitable status. Deputy Ó Caoláin raised a particular issue about the extent of tax concession or the advantage that charitable status confers. If there is an issue, it is open to the Minister for Finance to deal in a legislative manner by way of an Act of the Oireachtas with any particular concern that might lead to a shortfall in the revenue. That is not an appropriate matter for the Private Bill procedure. If the Mini ster for Finance felt that there was a loss to the Exchequer through the operation by colleges of particular tax schemes associated with charitable status, it would be open to him to address that through his proposals in the budget as subsequently enacted in finance legislation. However, it does not arise on a Private Bill before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Deputy Ó Caoláin got close to the sore as far as he was concerned in mentioning the question of the professional standards. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, in conjunction with other bodies of eminent physicians, decides what is appropriate in terms of treatment in hospitals. It is an incontestable scientific fact that the treatment of trauma after accidents nowadays requires an immense concentration of technology, personnel and resources. We all want to see the best standard of care for the patient.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Everyone knows that this cannot be sustained in the number of locations we have in Ireland. I know that I am going beyond the Private Bill here, but that is the reality. The various local agitations that have been promoted by Deputy Ó Caoláin in his county and by other Deputies in their counties, remind me of creationists in US Bible belt. The patient should come first in this matter and we should not say that science is incorrect and our locality is right, which, as I see it, is the case that is being made in these matters. However, this does not arise in the Bill either and I should not have trespassed into that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">In this particular institution, 80% of the students are non-EU nationals. Some €60 million is brought into the national economy through the operations of this institution. That is a sensible point of departure in the consideration of this Private Bill. This is a successful institution that is earning money for Ireland and is doing its job well. The institution has promoted a Private Bill asking the Oireachtas to amend its charter in various convenient ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Curiously, one amendment we could have pressed by way of this Private Bill procedure, but did not on this occasion, would have been the deletion of "Royal" from the name of the institution which could then have been called the "National College of Surgeons" if we had so wished. It is not for us to go into wider questions on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">With regard to the two amendments we are discussing, section 3 of the Bill revises paragraph 2 of the 1828 charter. The main objective of the revision is to remove a limit of £2,000 sterling, which was imposed on the college in respect of property. This is an anachronism that should be removed. The amendment proposed by Deputy Ó Caoláin, far from ameliorating the position, would remove altogether the capacity of the college to own property, which would be untenable for any large and expanding higher educational institution. The college needs that power to own property as is normal in any corporate body. As the simplest company, incorporated under the  Companies Act has a capacity to own property, I cannot see how we could accept this amendment.</p>

Some day, when the problem visits the Minister of State in a more direct way, he may appreciate exactly from where I am coming.

          <p eId="para_233">The Ceann Comhairle will have to accept that there are a number of key and critical factors in this Bill and the approach to it. My principle and primary objection is that it is being taken in this format. I re-emphasise the point that the Minister of State talked about in his response about bodies. This is a body but Standing Orders do not provide for bodies to promote private Bills. The Standing Order is specific when it refers to any "person" or "locality". I am  questioning procedure which is totally inappropriate to this institution.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">Amendments Nos. 3 and 14 come back to the same point of accountability. I have no doubt that if this Bill was presented by the Government as a public Bill, we would all benefit from a proper debate albeit our debating system is imperfect. However, what we have is the college as the proposers of this Private Bill and we are denied an opportunity to directly engage with them. The proposers are off-stage yet welcome in the House. There is no opportunity to get to the kernel of these amendments. I know that some of my amendments, as the Minister of State has pointed out, might be deemed technically deficient. I am prepared to accept that could be the case in an open engagement where I would be happy to withdraw or tweak them. However, as this legislation is being taken as a Private Bill, we ware denied that opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">I have put down these amendments to highlight various points already alluded to, particularly the status of the college and the accountability factor. Until such time that the Department of Education and Science and the public purse take responsibility for the role of the college, we are failing in our responsibilities to properly provide for the training and provision for key essential professionals within our health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">The role the college performs is an absolute necessity and is acknowledged by everyone in this House. What we need to see is the introduction of real accountability. I commend these amend ments to the Minister of State and the House with the limited opportunity now available to me.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_243">The amendments proposed by the Deputy relate to the powers of the college. The point of departure again is that this is a Private Bill, not a public one. In a Private Bill we deal with the corporate capacity of a corporation. It is a well established trend in modern jurisprudence in connection with corporate bodies that one has to widen the legal capacity of any body corporate. This is to ensure that no question of <i>ultra vires</i> can arise or no suggestion that the corporate body was acting outside the proper scope of its authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The proposed amendments to the charter will broaden the powers of the college in the management of its affairs, the admission of students and the conduct of research. The effect of accepting the Deputy's amendments in the context of a Private Bill would reduce the capacity of the college to engage in any of these activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The points on public interest and policy, the admission of students and the need for more training for medical graduates are acceptable in the context of a debate on the health services. However, the basic point of departure is that 80% of the students in the college are non-EU nationals and the college is earning €60 million in overseas earnings. I accept the Deputy's point on the domestic provision of medical graduates. If we so wish, negotiations can take place between the college and the relevant Ministers. I have no doubt the college would be co-operative and favourable to such an approach. However it is not an issue that arises in the context of the Private Bill. In these sections of the Private Bill, we are simply providing that as a private body, the college has the maximum freedom of manoeuvre in law. There is nothing offensive in that. However, were questions of public interest or policy to arise, they could be regulated by an Act of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">There are two critical areas in terms of powers. With regard to accountability, I am concerned about the potential expansion of the college's activities into further areas of business other than education. Concerns have been expressed to me  on a number of sections of the Bill where the college would be allowed the opportunity to expand into pharmaceutical promotion. As this is a Private Bill, again the opportunity to tease this out will be denied me. Examining sections 16 and 31, there is unquestionably a concern about the removal of certain restrictions that have applied heretofore. This would be an objectionable development and has echoes of the recent reports of some 40 members of the medical profession, at the behest of a pharmaceutical company, attending a special weekend break in County Kerry. That type of relationship is inappropriate between the pharmaceutical industry and people at the coalface of either medical or surgical provisions.</p>

The term "acting" was used in the Bill because a substitute was unlikely to be required frequently and because the acting chairperson's functions were confined to presiding over meetings or calling them when the chairperson was unavailable or unable to do so. On Report Stage I reiterated the view that acting was a more accurate and honest description. However, in deference to the strength of the Opposition's feelings on the matter, I accepted an amendment which replaced "acting chairperson" with "deputy chairperson" in section 7. These technical amendments are consequential on the acceptance of this amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil which will change the title "acting chairperson" to "deputy chairperson".

          <p eId="para_272">Under provisions elsewhere in the Bill, the commission will be endowed with authority, subject to authorisation by one or both Houses, to defend proceedings taken against Members. The purpose of this amendment is the narrower one of giving the commission the powers now held by the Minister for Finance in one Act, namely, the Oireachtas (Miscellaneous Provisions) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act 1996, to deal with situations where proceedings are being taken against a Member or a parliamentary party by a secretarial assistant employed by that Member or party in respect of a personal injury sustained in  the course of the assistant's employment. This measure was introduced in 1996 when a Deputy was sued in such circumstances and it was found that she would be personally liable unless there was a legal authority for the State to give financial support with legal costs and any damages awarded. Few such cases have arisen since. In essence, the commission will have the power to recoup in whole or in part to such Member or party any award or settlement, together with the costs incurred. This facility can only be provided in instances where the person sustained the injury in the course of employment as a secretarial assistant by a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or by a registered political party and where the person in question is paid by the Oireachtas commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">The section to which these amendments relate allows the commission, subject to authorisation by the Dáil, Seanad or both, to initiate, intervene or apply to be joined as a plaintiff on behalf of a Member. The Bill, as passed by the Dáil, specifies that such proceedings must arise from the Member's performance of functions as a Member of either House or committee. The amendments add two extra phrases, namely, that matters must arise "solely" from a Member's "parliamentary functions". This could be regarded as a lawyer's refinement and it is in line with the intent of the Bill as introduced in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">While theoretical decisions on what are the parliamentary functions of a Member could keep lawyers busy for a while, the point to keep in mind is that the interpretation falls on the commission or the House, which is the best body to make the call. A Senator who canvasses for himself or herself or a party colleague in a Dáil election and gets into an altercation, would be outside its scope. Likewise, a Deputy who spilled boiling water over a fellow guest at a local function would probably not be able to expect to persuade the commission that the resulting case against him or her arose solely from parliamentary functions just because the invitation was addressed to  him or her in his or her capacity as a Member of either House.</p>

Following correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle, it was decided to table an amendment which restored the requirement of prior consent from the Dáil, Seanad or both, as appropriate, where the commission was to act as a defendant. The amendment covers in separate subsections each of the groups which can be defended, as Members of the Dáil and its committees, Members of the Seanad and its committees and Members of joint committees. The amendment also stipulates where the commission may take on a defence. It sets out in clear and concise terms that the only instance where it may take on such a defence is regarding legal proceedings initiated solely from the performance by them of their parliamentary functions as Members.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">If someone is aggrieved by something a committee did or did not do and wants to take legal action, the decision of who will be targeted or named as defendant is taken by him or her, presumably with the advice of a lawyer. Normally, the practice has been to list all the members of the committee as a group, but committee members do not like this as it upsets them and their families. In every version of the Bill, we have tried to do something about this but we always ran up against one insuperable problem, that is, the fact that the plaintiff must decide who to name and the lawyers generally go for an overkill in case they ignore a possible defendant whose inclusion might be beneficial to them. The best we could do, therefore, was to provide an alternative target that would prove attractive to them.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">When this Bill was first aired I was not a Member of the House. It has not received a massive amount of public attention outside the House. The Bill is concerned with how this House will be run in the future and the say that Deputies and Senators will have in its running. It is certainly a positive Bill and I hope it will bring about the improvements we have discussed and to which we aspire.</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Despite the fact that the Bill will probably go through the House today without a word in the media, it is a very important occasion. We are changing the whole way in which the Houses of the Oireachtas are run, which will eventually have an effect on how democracy operates in this country. I see very positive possibilities for the way we do our jobs here in terms of ensuring that democracy is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The Houses will now, to a certain extent, be independent of the Department of Finance. Some people, including possibly some of those present today, might not like that, but it is a good thing that the Houses are to become financially independent. People can now make their own decisions and there will only be a battle every three years when the commission must negotiate the amount of money it will receive for the following three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">It is time that we had control over our business and this is a momentous day from that point of view. It is important that this commission is far-sighted and can take initiatives. It must consider what is happening in other democracies, pick the best developments and bring them to the House so that we can streamline our activities and make ourselves and the Dáil more accountable to the public. In this way, we can improve the image of the Houses in terms of the way we do our business, spend our money and represent the people that sent us here. From that point, of view this is a good day.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I am glad that the Bill has been finalised before the summer recess and despite the fact that the  commission will not officially take up its position until 1 January, I hope it will be able to sit between now and then on an interim basis and prepare for the job it will be doing. I hope that the Ceann Comhairle will take the initiative in assembling the body to get the preliminary work under way. The commission is important for all of us and for democracy. We have done a good day's work.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I am glad that this Bill has now passed. The Labour Party welcomes its passage and the establishment of the commission to run the Houses of the Oireachtas. I compliment the Minister and thank, in particular, Mr. Gallagher and his staff, who have worked extremely hard on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Based on the financial figures issued yesterday, the deteriorating state of tax revenues and demands in areas such as disability and hospital services and education, the upcoming Estimates campaign will be savage. Despite this, the Houses of the Oireachtas have been given a relatively generous allocation by the Minister for Finance. The Bill provides for a sum of €295,000 over a three-year period, which is an increase on the previous amount. We know that large portions of that are related to benchmarking increases in pay and so on, but, nevertheless, there will be extra funding available. I hope that as much as possible of that funding will be made available to Members and to the parties for the purpose of research so that we may do our jobs as parliamentarians as well as possible. Everybody is used to Ministers having teams of advisers and numerous civil servants to do their work, while Opposition spokespersons have little in the way of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">There will be an opportunity to use some of the extra funding, not only to benefit the work of the Members but to benefit the services we provide to the public. I hope the commission will take the opportunity to do that. The Labour Party offered fair and reasonable criticism of the Bill in a number of respects. I reiterate my concern that, in many ways, the commission is excessively dominated by the Government. That could be addressed by the Government's representatives on the commission being independent, experienced and strong-minded people. We know there are such Deputies in both Government parties so I hope the Government will chose to appoint that type of Deputy to the commission. Things can change in the House. It may seem to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, that the Government will stay in office forever but let me assure him that it will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I regret that the Labour Party's amendment seeking to appoint a staff member to the commission was not accepted. That was a mistake and is not in line with modern European practice. It could have been done and would have benefited the future work of the commission. That being said, I wish the commission well and I congratu late the Minister of State on the passage of the Bill.</p>

I wish the new commission a fair wind in its efforts to address the many reforms highlighted by those participating in the debate on the Bill. There is much to be done and I hope the Minister of State will have noted many of the matters that were raised. I look forward to a more productive session in the Houses of the Oireachtas when it resumes in the autumn.</p>

In many parts of the world, people are dying of curable diseases because the drugs necessary to save their lives cannot be afforded by health services in poor countries.

It is extremely important to insert a reference to the ethical aspects of the legislation.

Ethical issues in science are a real concern today. It is all very well for the scientific world to push out its boundaries to include new discoveries and abilities but there is a need to adhere to high ethical standards. It has never been more pressing to do so than at present. I hope the Minister of State will examine carefully what steps he may take in the context of these amendments to ensure we will have the highest possible ethical standards.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_324">I do not propose to accept these amendments. Through the direction of its board, Science Foundation Ireland will be required to meet the highest ethical standards in corporate governance, the disbursement of public funds and in supporting scientific endeavours. As regards ethically sensitive research, the Minister for Health and Children established the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, in March 2000, to prepare a report on possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal  factors to be taken into account when determining public policy in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The issues that come within the terms of reference of the commission's examination are highly complex and sensitive, covering matters of medical, scientific, social, legal and ethical concern, such as cloning and research on embryos. The membership of the commission is drawn from a variety of relevant fields, including medicine, science, law and social science. The commission has sought the views of all concerned on this issue, including service providers, consumers, philosophical and theological experts and the public. This will ensure the deliberations of the commission will be informed by as comprehensive a consultation process as necessary, with a view to ensuring that the commission has the benefit of a wide range of perspectives in reaching its conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The approach of the Minister for Health and Children, in seeking to have all the issues that come within the ambit of assisted human reproduction, including human cloning, examined in the first instance by the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, with a view to producing a comprehensive set of recommendations, is the best one. Once the commission has produced its report later this year, I am assured there will be no undue delay in advancing the next stage of the process to bring forward policy proposals to regulate the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">In addition, the Tánaiste has established an Irish Council for Bioethics, as an independent body under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy, to consider the ethical issues raised by developments in biotechnology. The council will identify and interpret the ethical questions raised by biological and medical research in order to respond to and anticipate questions of substantive concern. It will also investigate and report on such questions in the interests of promoting public understanding, informed discussion and education. In addition, it will stimulate discussion through conferences, workshops, lectures and published reports. Where appropriate, it will suggest guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">The work of both bodies will help to contribute towards the formulation of policy in the sensitive area of bioethics and, therefore, it would not be appropriate to deal with the issue in this legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_336">I do not propose to accept the amendments. Any review, updating or amendment of intellectual property is a matter for the intellectual property unit of my Department and any views the foundation might have on such issues would, of course, be considered by that unit. Science Foundation Ireland has developed detailed terms and conditions which attach to its grants and these outline the conditions that apply to the ownership and commercialisation of intellectual property. It would not be appropriate to copperfasten these terms and conditions in legislation, as that level of detail is more appropriately determined by the board of the foundation. Flexibility is also required to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The terms and conditions that attach to the foundation's grants set out the criteria which applies to intellectual property. These include the following: that the intellectual property produced by the programme, where commercially appropriate, is exploited and commercialised; that, whenever possible, intellectual property shall be managed for the benefit of enterprise development in Ireland; that, as a result of commercialisation, attractive incentives and financial returns are provided to the principal investigator, the research team and the research body; and that a share of the returns from exploitation and commercialisation of intellectual property arising from research funded by the foundation shall be paid to the foundation to contribute towards the development of the foundation and the funding of further research in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Ownership of intellectual property resulting from a research programme is vested in the host research body and if the research body does not move to exploit or commercialise IP, it can agree to appoint the foundation as its exclusive agent to exploit the IP on its behalf or to assign the IP rights to a third party nominated by the foundation. The overall provisions, therefore, provide a comprehensive approach to ensuring the research body moves to exploit IP.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I refer to the centres for science engineering and technology programme, in which specific industry participation is involved. Each intellectual property agreement will be analysed separately by the foundation's legal experts to ensure consistency with the overall terms and conditions and additional provisions will be attached if required to ensure that they are fair and balanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Commercialisation of intellectual property is an important issue. A working group, under the aegis of the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation, has examined the issue and recently published a statement. The group concluded that a legislative approach was not necessary in Ireland at this time and recommended a code of best practice on the subject. This is being progressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Enterprise Ireland, together with IDA Ireland, SFI, Forfás, the Higher Education Authority and the Health Research Board, is also working on a system designed to strengthen the commercialisation structures in research performers, primarily, universities and institutes of technology. It would not be appropriate to vest all intellectual property in the foundation, as this would effectively eliminate the incentive to identify and create intellectual property and lead to considerable loss of commercial opportunities for Ireland. The challenge is to incentivise commercialisation of the outputs of research and secure a fair return for the foundation. This is achieved through the published terms and conditions of the foundation.</p>

While section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) is all-embracing and covers other areas, a wider and more general definition would be appropriate.

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_346">I support the amendment. A broadening of the definition is desperately needed for the sake of the foundation. A number of people involved in the foundation realise scientific endeavour and research works best when it is not limited to specific areas. We do not know what will be the scientific areas of greatest benefit to our society and the definition should not be this narrow. The legislation over-emphasises economic interests and minimises societal and environmental interests. While the Minister of State has made amendments in the Seanad and on Committee Stage to broaden it, the wording fails terribly to espouse a broad vision. There is a remarkable difference in the objectives and ambitions of other science foundation agencies, as they address issues such as climate change and development of human as well as economic capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I regret that the opportunity has been lost to set a broad vision. It may be self-defeating to set it on a narrow economic focus because the development of the economy moves in strange directions as a result of strange causes and effects. The best way to develop an economy is to allow people to conduct their own research, be creative and analyse areas where a return could be generated, even though it might not be expected, through their ingenuity, creativity and investigative instincts. The Bill is narrow in this regard and I support the amendment.</p>

It is very important that the Oireachtas as a whole has a proactive role and greater interest in science and technology, which I would welcome. As it stands, the impact of science is narrowed down to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, excluding the Department of Education and Science. In that regard considerable concerns have arisen regarding the PRTLI funding. I and others have also raised questions about Higher Education Authority funding and PRTLI.

          <p eId="para_387">The amendment proposes to oblige the foundation to submit its report to the Minister within three months of the end of the year.

Gheofá amach nach bhfuil na seirbhísí sin le fáil tré mheán na Gaeilge. Níl an Bille seo cosúil le ceann Cheanada. Tá gach uile sheirbhís de chuid an Stáit ann. Caithimid glacadh leis nach bhfuil na seirbhísí ar fáil, is cuma céard a cheapann daoine. Muna dtosóimid ag an bpointe sin ní dhéanfaimid aon dul chun cinn. Tá a fhios againn nach bhfuiltear in ann cáin bóthair, fiú amháin, a fháil go héasca in mBaile Átha Cliath, i nGaillimh nó san nGaeltacht féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Leagfaidh an Bille seo síos, de réir an dlí, riaracháin agus pleananna, bun-leibhéal seirbhíse. Sin an tús. De réir na comhairle atá faighte agam ón Ard Aighne, caithfear glacadh leis sin mar bhun shraith ach caithfidh an ghluaiseacht a bheith i dtreo na Gaeilge ina dhiaidh sin amach. Is é sin le rá go bhfuil ceart ag an Aire aontú le leibhéal áirid seirbhíse trí Ghaeilge ag an tús. Ar ndóigh, ní ghlacaim leis an leibhéal atá ann anois ach ní bheidh mé ag éileamh go mbeidh gach rud, thar oíche, ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge ar gach uile bhealach. Tá rudaí áirid a bhéas ar fáil do gach uile dhuine go bunúsach, mar shampla comhfhreagras.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Is an áit a éiríonn an fhadhb, na seirbhísí idir-phearsanra. Is é a deir an Bille, ná go gcaithfidh sé sin a bheith mar bhunshraith na scéimeanna. Níl aon cheist go mbeidh Aire ag iarraidh cúlú air mar ní bheidh cead aige é sin a dhéanamh. Tá sé sin soiléir má léitear alt 10<i>(b).</i> Tar éis a rá go mbeidh seirbhísí áirid i mBéarla amháin caithfidh comhlucht a rá cad a dhéanfaidh sé chun na seirbhísí sin a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge amach anseo. Ansin deir alt 10(3) gur féidir leis an Aire, “le toil an Aire Airgeadais, a ordú do chomhlacht poiblí, i ndáil leis na seirbhísí sin dá chuid a sheachadtar trí mheán an Bhéarla amháin, plean a tharraingt suas chun na seirbhísí sin a sheachadadh trí mheán na Gaeilge”.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Caithfimid a bheith praiticiúil agus réasúnta. Níl ach fíor-bheagán seirbhísí atá le fáil trí Ghaeilge. Táimid ag leagan síos bun-shraith nua atá i bhfad níos fearr ná an ceann atá ann. Tógfar ó sin go mbeidh an constitutional imperative, mar a deirtear i mBéarla, á chomhlíonadh. Níl aon bhunús leis an imní atá á scaipeadh imeasc an phobail gur féidir dul siar ón bpointe tosaigh sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Dá dtógfaí an cur chuige ciallmhar, stuama, céimithe seo 70 bliain ó shin b'fhearr i bhfad a bheadh stádas na Gaeilge inniu thar mar atá sé. Bheadh sé bunaithe ar spriocanna a d'fhéadfaí a bhaint amach agus ar sheirbhísí a d'fhéadfaí a chur ar fáil. Tuigimid na hargóintí ar fad a deineadh leis na blianta. Ar tháinig ann don tríú Dáil i gceart, an bhfuil an dara Dáil fós ann nó ar scaradh i gceart í? Ach ag deireadh glacaimid uile, nó  glacann formhór an phobail, go bhfuilimid imithe ó sin agus go bhfuil an Dáil áirithe seo dlisteanach. An rud céanna leis an nGaeilge. Glacaim leis go bhfuil sé deacair, i bprionsabal, géilleadh don fhíric nach bhfuil gach seirbhís, idir ollscoileanna, ospidéil agus eile, le fáil trí Ghaeilge i bhfógraíocht, i gcomhfhreagras nó ar leibhéal pearsanta. Sin an ídéal atá ann ach má táimid ag iarradh dul go dtí an ídéal sin caithfimid tosú ar bhonn réalaíoch agus ceart.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Ar mhaithe le todhchaí na Gaeilge, tá mise sásta a bheith praiticiúil agus réalaíoch agus a bheith cinnte nach féidir dul siar. Tá sé scríofa san mBille, agus deirtear freisin, go bhfuil brú bunreachtúil tugtha i mbreithiúnas Hardiman, gur ar aghaidh a chaithfimid a dhul. Ar na cúisí sin ar fad, agus ar an chúis nach mbeadh aon fheidhm leis na focail atá á moladh a chur isteach sa mBille, ní bheidh mé ag glacadh leo.</p>

          <p eId="para_419">Luaigh sé alt (11)(<i>b</i>) –“na bearta a bheartaíonn an comhlacht a ghlacadh chun a chinntiú go ndéanfar aon seirbhísí eile nach soláthríonn an comhlacht trí mheán na Gaeilge a sholáthar amhlaidh”. Tig le comhlact a rá nach bhfuil sé ag déanamh aon bheart agus an ceart aige mar, faoi alt 14(1), “aon scéim déanta le toiliú cheann an chomlachta phoiblí lena mbaineann” agus, in alt 11(3), is “le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais go bhféadfaidh – ní déanfaidh – an tAire a ordú do chomhlacht poiblí, i ndáil leis na seirbhísí sin dá chuid a sheachadtar trí mheán an Bhéarla amháin, plean a tharraingt suas chun na seirbhísí sin a sheachadadh trí mheán na Gaeilge chomh maith”.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Níl sin láidir go leor domsa mar Ghaeilgeoir a lig an Stát seo orm ó rugadh mé i dtaobh seirbhísí Gaeilge. Ba chóir go mbeadh an Bille dearfach agus go mbeadh "déanfaidh" in alt 11(3) nó nglanfaí "i mBéarla amhain" as an Acht.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Tá leasuithe eile ag déileáil le toil cheann an chomhlachta poiblí agus toil an Aire Airgeadais. Tá Airí ann nach bhfuil báúil leis an Ghaeilge agus a dhéanfaidh aon rud le déanamh cinnte nach n-éireoidh le a leithéid d'Acht. Ní gá ach féachaint ar na leasuithe a diúltaíodh toisc go mbeadh muirear ionchasacht ar ioncam i gceist iontu. Sin seafóid. Tá a leithéid i gceist sa Bhille ar fad agus níl muid ach ag iarraidh cur leis agus is trua go bhfuil leasuithe rialaithe as ord dá bharr sin.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">Cuireann sé isteach go mór orm go bhfuil seans ann go bhfuil rudaí ag baint leis an Bhille a bheidh os comhair na cúirte. Dá bhrí sin, caithfidh gach rud ó thaobh na reachtaíochta de agus ó thaobh an Bhunreachta de bheith soiléir agus cruinn. Tá an tAire a rá go bhfuil "belt and braces approach" sa leasú ach más rud é go nglacfaidh sé leis, cé nach síleann sé go bhfuil gá leis, tá seans ann nach mbeidh cásanna os comhair na cúirte.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Nuair a bhíonn daoine amhrasach faoi reachtaíocht, tá an chontúirt ann go mbeidh cás cúirte ann agus airgead caillte gur féidir a chaitheadh ar rudaí níos fiúntasaí ar son na Gaeilge. Seo hiad daoine a thugann tacaíocht mór don Ghaeilge agus tá siad thar a bheith imníoch faoin Bhille. Nuair a bheidh an Bille seo rite, tá seans ann go mbeidh siad ar mheon an rud ar fad a thabhairt os comhair na cúirte, rud nach mbeadh maith le duine ar bith. Níl seo simplí mar tá daoine an-bhuartha agus más féidir linn an buarthacht sin a réitiú, sin obair mhaith.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">Nuair a thosaigh mé an obair seo, bhí a fhios agam go dtiocfaimis go dtí an pointe seo. Bhí a fhios agam go raibh daoine fós a chreid go raibh gach seirbhís ar fáil ón Stát i nGaeilge, ainneoin gur léir nach mar sin atá sé ó lá go lá. Tá daoine ann a chreideann go bhféadfaidh Acht a rith a dhéanfadh chuile sheirbhís – chuile leachtóir ollscoile agus chuile sheirbhíseach poiblí ag labhairt na Gaeilge chuile lá – a chur ar fáil agus gan ach 70,000 daoine fásta sa tír a labhrann Gaeilge go laethiúil. Tá níos mó ná 4 milliún daoine clúdaithe faoin mBille seo. Bhí a fhios agam go mbeadh an fhadhb seo ann agus dúirt mé liom féin go bhfuil sé aghaidh a thabhairt uirthi.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">Má tá sé míbhunreachtúil, ní dhéanfaidh sé bunreachtúil é trína a rá, "tá sé bunreachtúil". Níl aon fheidhm leis na focail atá molta. Má tá sé bunreachtúil, tá sé bunreachtúil agus ní dhéanfaidh sé aon difir na focail a chur isteach ach oiread. Creidim go cinnte go bhfuil an Bille bunreachtúil.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Luaigh an Teachta Ó Snodaigh alt 11(1)(b). Ní amháin go gcaithfidh ceann an chomhlachta a toiliú ach caithfidh an tAire toiliú. Ní féidir leis an Aire toiliú ar neamhní mar bhearta le seirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. Níl aon bhunús leis an argóint.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Maidir le toiliú an Aire Airgeadais, tá gach rud ar aon bhealach ag brath ar an Rialtas mar níl  ach Rialtas amháin ann. Tá 15 bhall sa Rialtas agus Rialtas amháin agus mar sin ní féidir le héinne airgead an Stáit a chaitheamh gan toiliú an Aire Airgeadais. Sin an fáth nach féidir leis an bhFreasúra costas a chur ar an Stát de réir Buanordaithe an Tí seo. Is argóint chiorclach sin agus nuair a bheidh na Teachtaí thall ar an taobh seo beimid ag déanamh an rud céanna.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Iarrann daoine cad é bhí i gceist in Airteagal 8º3 den Bhunreacht. Bhí trí rud i gceist. Tá ceist an Tuaiscirt dearfa. Creidim go raibh sé i gceist gur cheart seirbhísí a chur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge amháin ar fud na tíre nó san nGaeltacht. Níl éinne tar éis tagairt a dhéanamh don cheart a bhéas againn anois seirbhísí a chur ar fáil i nGaeilge amháin agus gan aon cheart ag éinne a rá go bhfuil ceart aige na seribhísí seo a fháil trí Bhéarla. Is é an tríú rud a bhí i gceist ná gur thuig lucht scríofa an Bhunreachta nach mbeadh sé praiticiúil dá mba rud é go raibh duine in ann cás cúirte a thógáil agus gach uile sheirbhís den Stát, go díreach agus go hindireach, a éileamh trí mheán na Gaeilge. Thuigeadar an sáinn ina bhfuilimse. Is é sin go gcaithfidh mé géilleadh don phraiticiúlacht má táimid chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Feicim cosúlacht idir seo agus an Tuaisceart. Mar shampla, ba mhaith le Fianna Fáil, le Fine Gael, le Pairtí an Lucht Oibre agus le Sinn Féin Éire a bheith aontaithe, saor, neamhspleách agus poblachtach. Ach bhíomar sásta comh-ghéilleadh a dhéanamh chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh. Rinne Sinn Féin, Fine Gael, an Lucht Oibre agus muid féin é. Ar mhaithe le dul chun cinn bhí orainn rudaí áirithe a ghéilleadh. Macasamhail atá i gceist leis an mBille seo. Muna bhfuilimid sásta an comhghéilleadh sin a dhéanamh ar mhaithe le dul chun cinn, ní leas na Gaeilge atáimid ag déanamh.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Is cuma cé chomh mór le rá is atá daoine. Tá ceart acu-san a dtuairim a bheith acu agus tá ceart agam mo thuarim féin a bheith agam. Bíodh daoine mór le rá nó gan a bheith mór le rá, agus creidim go bhfuil gach duine mór le rá, tá dul amú orthu sa gcás seo mar a chreidim, i gcúrsaí polaitíochta, go bhfuil dul amú ar an dream a chreideann go mba cheart dul ar ais go dtí an dara Dáil.</p>

Ach ba chóir go mbeadh na focail seo san Acht. Thabharfadh an leasú seo gach cead do dhuine ar bith Béarla nó Gaeilge a lab hairt ach thabharfadh sé áit speisialta don Ghaeilge.

De réir an chomhairle a fuair me, ní clúdaíonn an sainmhíniú seo rudaí cosúil leis an Bhinse Achomhairc Fostaithe. Deir sé sa Bhille go bhfolaíonn "cúirt" binse arna bhunú faoi na hAchtanna um Binsí Fiosrúcháin (Fianaise) 1921 go 1998. Tá mé buartha nach mbeadh eagraíochtaí Stáit cosúil leis an Bhinse Achomhairc Fostaithe clúdaithe.</p>

Mar a thug mé le fios ag an am, de réir an chomhairle dlí atá fós faighte agam, tá an míniú léiriú ar "chúirt" sa Bhille an-leathan ar fad sa méid is nach bhfuil sé uileghabhálach. Níl ráite sa míniú ach go bhfuil binsí fiosrúcháin nach luaitear de  ghnáth i gcomhthéacs cúirte san áireamh. Níl cosc curtha ar bhinsí nó ar chomhlachtaí den tsort atá i gceist ag na Teachtaí. Mura go dteastódh uaim go mbeadh na binsí clúdaithe, ní chuirfinn isteach faoi leith iad.

Ba mhaith liom a chur leis sin "agus aon teanga eile a aithnítear de thuras na huaire mar theanga oifigiúil chun aon chríche sa Stát.".</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Nuair a phlé muid an leasú seo ar Chéim an Choiste, dúirt mé go bhfuil an tír anois ilchultúrtha agus go bhfuil, mar shampla, 50,000 Sínigh anseo. Iad siúd atá ina saoránach, ba cheart go mbeadh siad ar chomhchéim le héinne eile sa tír ó thaobh cearta teanga de.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">Labhair mé fosta faoin litir a fuair mé ó Chumann Daoine Bodhartha na hÉireann ar Irish sign language agus gur ceart go mbeadh sin aitheanta mar theanga dúchais. Mar a bhí scríofa sa litir, tá 50,000 daoine sa tír ag baint úsáid as Irish sign language. Tá aitheantas oifigiúil do theanga chomharthaíochta i bhFionnlainn, san Phortaingéil, i bPoblacht na Seice agus sa Ghréig. Bhí dhá rún a ghlaoigh ar stáit san AE go mbeadh aitheantas ann do theanga chomharthaíochta i mbunreachta na mballstáit os comhair Parlaimint na hEorpa, ceann i 1988 agus ceann eile 1999, agus glacadh leo.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Níor tháinig an teanga seo ón Bhéarla. D'fhorbair sé faoina stuaim féin agus tá cuid mhór daoine sa tír a úsáideann an teanga sin gan aon teanga eile acu. Ní thuigim conas nach féidir leis an Aire glacadh leis an leasú. Bhí an tír thar a bheith áthasach faoi na Special Olympics. Seo seans don Aire rud éigin a thabhairt do na daoine seo a dhéanfadh maitheas dóibh agus a chuideodh lena saol. Ní fheicim aon rud i gcoinne sin má fheicimid ar an gceist seo ar bhonn cothrom.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Labhair mé faoi Ulster Scots agus dúirt an Teachta Ó Snodaigh gur canúint agus nach teanga í. Ba mhaith liom tuairim an Aire a chloisteáil faoi sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Dá nglacfadh an tAire leis an leasú seo, nó dá dtabharfadh sé a leasú féin isteach, bheadh cearta  teanga ag daoine bodhartha as seo amach.

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_467">I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a small contribution on the Report Stage of this Bill. On Second Stage, I mentioned an issue that is related to amendment No. 10. This was more specifically outlined in amendment No. 9, which was ruled out of order because of a charge to the Exchequer. We would make a mistake to ignore the existence of Irish sign language. This is an opportunity to recognise that as a language in itself. It is a language that has been in existence for long enough to receive proper recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">We are looking at a languages equality Bill that offers official recognition to Irish as a first language and English as a second. However, we cannot ignore a language and a form of communication that is unique to Ireland and used by a large number of Irish people. For those people concerned, it is their first language. They are Irish citizens and the language they use as their first language should be recognised in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">It is regrettable that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has not shared my view point on this issue. I understand that offering Irish sign language official recognition might have a financial consequence on the Exchequer. We cannot change what is in the Constitution without a referendum. I was looking for a wording in the legislation that would say Dáil Éireann officially recognises the existence of Irish sign as a language used by some on this island as a first language. I was not calling for a referendum for this to be included in the Constitution. If the Minister and his Department wanted to accommodate my concerns, they could have done so without a significant charge – there may have been some small charge – on the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The Minister clearly indicated he will not accept my line of thought. However, I hope he will give some thought to recognition to what is an Irish language and mode of communication. It is a first language for a large number of people on this island who do not have the luxury of speech or hearing and rely on Irish sign language. They are as Irish as the rest of us here and their first language should be recognised and respected by this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">Aontaím go mór leis an méid atá ráite ag na Teachtaí Coveney agus O'Shea faoin gcuid seo den mBille. Tá sé soiléir, ní hamháin gur teanga í ach gurb í an t-aon teanga í gur féidir leis na daoine seo a úsáid. Sin rud an-bhunúsach ar fad. Tuigim nach féidir leis an Aire freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist seo inniu, ach tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh an t-Aire agus an Rialtas sásta smaoineamh ar an gceist seo agus teacht ar ais go dtí an Dáil sa chéad seisiún eile.  Bheadh ar an Aire labhairt le hAirí eile, particularly with the Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">This is the only language these people have. They cannot communicate in any other way. It is such a fundamental human rights issue for them and a basic principle nowadays, that it should be facilitated in legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I ran a conference some years ago for 150 people. One lady attending asked if we had a sign language provision for somebody with her. She maintained that was her right, yet we could not provide that service. I learned about this issue from that incident. People must assert their rights. I ask the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs to reflect on the views that have been expressed here, to go to the Government and return in the autumn with a proposal on the matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_474">I wish to make a correction. I referred to this as the languages equality Bill when it is in fact the Official Languages Bill. Equality, admittedly, is a word in the title in brackets. The Bill is about the recognition of official languages in the State. I am not proposing that all languages used by people on this island receive recognition from this House or in the Constitution as official languages of Ireland. I am referring to a uniquely Irish language and mode of communication which has grown and evolved over decades.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">Is é an teideal atá ar an mBille, Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla. Níl ach dhá theanga oifigiúil sa Stát seo agus ní bheidh, go ndéanfar athrú ar an mBunreacht. Is iad an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla. Ar ndóigh, tugtar aitheantas do go leor teangacha sa tír seo ar bhealaí éagsúla, do theifigh agus do dhaoine a rugadh agus a tógadh sa tír seo. Tá sé tábhachtach go ndéanfaimid é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Tá seanfhocal sa Ghaeilge: Is é an bóthar mór an t-athghiorra. In other words: The high road is the short cut. Má tá daoine ag iarraidh go mbeidh stádas theanga oifigiúla ag an teanga comharthaíochta is é an bealach le tabhairt faoi ná an cheist seo a chur faoi bhráid an choiste a dhéanann scrúdú ar an mBunreacht, í a phlé ansin agus teacht ar ais le moladh a chuirfear faoi bhráid an phobail i reifreann. Má déantar teanga oifigiúil di beidh orainn an reachtaíocht seo a leasú dá réir.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Idir an dá linn, tá sé tábhachtach go dtabharfaimid aitheantas don teanga comharthaíochta. Bhí duine liom aréir a bhain úsáid as an teanga sin le labhairt liom. Pléifidh mé an cheist seo le mo chomhghleacaí, an t-Aire Dlí agus Cirt, Comhionannais agus Athchóirithe Dlí le gur féidir leis é a thógáil san áireamh nuair a bheidh Bille á thabhairt chun cinn ó thaobh seirbhísí a bheith ar fáil agus ó thaobh na ceiste praiticiúla a d'ardaigh an Teachta O'Dowd, ach ní seo an áit le tosú.</p>

          <p eId="para_488">Seo ceist faoi toil an Aire Airgeadais. Ní gá go mbeadh seo fríd an Bhille. Tá sé luaite in alt 3, áit a deir sé:</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Déanfar na caiteachais a thabhóidh an tAire agus aon Aire eile den Rialtas ag riaradh an Achta seo a íoc, a mhéid a cheadóidh an tAire Airgeadais, as airgead a sholáthróidh an tOireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Sin cead, ní toil, agus tá difir mór ann. Is cóir go scriosfar na tairgairtí don Aire Airgeadais.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Tá sé aisteach go bhfuil ceann amháin de na leasuithe seo faoi toil an Aire Airgeadais rialta as ord ag an Cheann Comhairle ar bhonn go bhfuil muirear ionchasach ar ioncam i gceist agus níl na cinn eile. Tuigim gur cleachtais Dála sin ach, le bheith réalaíoch faoi, ní féidir leis an bhFreasúra riamh airgead a tharraingt as Ciste an Stáit. Ba chóir go mbeadh na leasuithe seo ceadaithe agus go mbeimis in ann déileáil leo ar bhonn parlaiminte. Má ghlacann an Rialtas leo, é a bheidh ag glacadh go mbeidh ar Chiste an Stáit íoc as, ní sinne mar ní féidir linn. Sin an fáth go bhfuil muid ar an dtaobh seo den Teach. Bíonn an argóint sin seafóideach.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Tá súil agam go leasfar an córas anseo sa dóigh is gur féidir linn déileáil le leasaithe atá réalaíoch. Níl mé ach ag iarraidh go scriosfar "toil an Aire Airgeadais". Cad chuige nach bhfuil "toil an Rialtais" ann? Tá sé scríofa cheana go bhfuil gach uile costas a thagann as an Acht seo ag teacht le cead an Aire Airgeadais. Tá "toil" difriúil. Níl a fhios agam cad é meon an Aire Airgeadais faoin Ghaeilge ach d'fhéadfaí go mbeadh Rialtas ann agus Aire Airgeadais ann gan bá ar bith i leith na Gaeilge aige. Tá mé ar lorg go mbainfí "toil an Aire Airgeadais" as an Bhille agus go mbeimis in ann brath ar Aire Ghaeilge a bheidh ag brú go ndéanfar na rialacháin seo gan bheith ag brath ar toil an Aire Airgeadais.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Tá a fhios agam go ndéarfaidh an tAire gur foirm focail atá i gceist agus go bhfuil Rialtas i gceist. Má tá sin i gceist, ba chóir é a scríobh sa mBille. Bunrud atá an Rialtas ag rá ná gur chóir go mbeadh dlíthe simplí. Má tá cíall le rud atá ann, ba cheart go scríofaí é agus gan é a chur i bhfolach i bhfocal eile.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Impím ar an Aire glacadh leis seo sa dóigh is nach mbeidh orainn géilleadh do rud amháin nó rud eile toisc gur seo an rud atá os ár gcomhair agus go gcaithimid glacadh leis mar gur seo an rud is fearr.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Seo cosúil le Comhaontú Aoine an Chéasta. Ghlac muid leis ach rinne muid iarracht go dtí an noiméid deireanach é a athrú ionnas go mbeadh an rud is fearr é leis an méid is mó ónár dtaobh. Nuair a bhí an Rialtas ag gabháil do Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta bhí sé ar lorg rudaí go dtí an noiméid deireannach. Sin an fáth go bhfuil mé ag cur na leasuithe seo go dtí an noiméid deireannach – beimid in ann a rá go ndéarna muid iarracht meon an Rialtais a athrú ar an gceist seo agus go mbainfí amach "le toil an Aire Airgeadais" mar tá sé clúdaithe cheana agus tugann sé treo mícheart don chuid eile den Bhille.</p>

          <p eId="para_496">Tá sé coitianta i measc an phobail an tuairim seo go bhféadfadh ar bhealach éigin Rialtas a roghnú sa gcaoi is go mbeidh Airí a dhéanfaidh go leor rudaí i nganfhios don Aire Airgeadais. Dá ndéanfaí sin, ní Rialtas a bheadh ann ach 15 rialtais agus ní shin an leagan amach bunreachtúil atá againn. Mar sin, bíodh sé scríofa  nó ná bíodh, ní féidir le hAirí costas a tharraingt gan an sparanaí a aontú leis.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Deir an Teachta Ó Snodaigh gur ceart cur isteach go gcaithfidh mé toil an Rialtais a fháil. Má dhéanaim sin, chuile uair a bheidh mé ag iarraidh rialachán a dhéanamh, caithfidh mé meanram oifigiúil a chur faoi bhráid an Rialtais agus a chead a fháil. Tá sé i bhfad níos fusa go praicticiúil cead an Aire Airgeadais a fháil mar níl aon mheanram mór Rialtas i gceist. Dá mba rud é go raibh coimhlint idir bheirt Aire – an tAire Airgeadais agus an An tAire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta – agus nach raibh siad in ann é a réitiú, tá an ceart ag na hAirí dhul chuig an Rialtas agus a rá nach bhfuil siad in ann an cheist a réitiú eatarthu agus chaithfeadh an Rialtas treoir a thabhairt. Sa ghnáthobair laethúil, is fusa i bhfad an fhoirm "le toil an Aire Airgeadais" seachas a bheith ag caint faoi dhul chuig an Rialtas faoi chuile rialachán faoin mBille seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Bíodh sé ann nó ná bíodh sé ann, ní athraíonn sé an fhírinne – nach féidir costas a tharraingt gan an tAire Airgeadais a bheith san áireamh agus sin a fáth atá sé sa mBille. Is fusa go meicniúil fosta cead an Aire Airgeadais a fháil ná go gcaithfidh meanram Rialtais iomlán a réitiú faoin chuile rialachán. Ar an mbonn sin, d'iarrfainn ar an Teachta an leasú a tharraingt siar.</p>

          <p eId="para_500">Níl mé chun é a tharraing siar. Tá difríocht mhór idir chead agus toil an Aire Airgeadais. Chun cead a thabhairt ní gá dó ach meamram a shíniú. Is ionann na focail Béarla sanction agus consent. Ní gá don fhocal a bheith ann. Deirtear cheana san mBille gur gá don Rialtas glacadh leis, ó thaobh airgid de, gurb é an t-Aire Airgeadais a shineoidh an meamram. Ní bhaineann toil leis sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Deir an t-Aire nach féidir le hAire déanamh mar is mian leis. B'fhiú dó é sin a rá leis an Teachta McDowell, a bhíonn ag fógairt Billí nua agus caiteachas Rialtais gach lá ar an raidió agus gan cuma ar an scéal go bhfuil eolas ag an Rialtas fúthu nuair a chuirimid ceist ar an Taoiseach an lá dar gcionn.

Tá an t-Aire Dlí agus Cirt, Comhionnanais agus Athchóirithe Dlí tar éis a lán rudaí a fhógairt ins na meáin nach raibh i bplean reachtaíochta an Rialtais agus nach raibh eolas ag an Taoiseach nó ag an Tánaiste fúthu.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I leith caiteachais, tá sé scríofa in alt 3 go bhfuil an Rialtas ar fad i gceist agus go gceadóidh an t-Aire é.

Ach caithfear coinneáil leis an tuairim go bhfeidhmíonn an Rialtas mar aonad. Níl aon bunús bunreachtúil leis an smaoineamh seo atá ag dul thart go bhféadfadh na hAirí bob a bhualadh ar a chéile agus dul ar aghaidh lena rudaí féin. Deirtear go soiléir san mBunreacht go bhfuil gach Aire freagrach as gníomhaire agus gnóithí gach Aire eile. Tá sin sonraithe san mBunreacht. Mar sin, is cineál argóint gan mórán bunús atá anseo.</p>

          <p eId="para_510">Tá sé i bhfad níos áisiúla, ó lá go lá, gur cead an Aire Airgeadais a bheadh i gceist, seachas a bheith ag dul chuig an Rialtas.

Tá sé cosúil lena rá linn dul i gcomhairle leis na breithiúna agus muid ag déanamh dlithe agus iarraidh orthu, ina dhiaidh sin, breithiúnas a thabhairt orthu. Ar ndóigh, bhéadh an breitheamh beagáinín páirteach faoin gcomhairle a thabharfadh sé. Mar an gcéanna leis an gcoimisinéir. Caithfidh an coimisinéir a bheith neamhspleách agus feicthe a bheith neamhspleách. Thiocfadh sé salach ar an neamhspleáchas sin dá mbeadh sé ag tabhairt comhairle d'Aire maidir le rialacháin a bheadh ar intinn ag an Aire a dhéanamh. Tá, mar shampla, cead ag an gcoimisinéir tráchtaireacht a dhéanamh ar fheidhmiú an Achta ó am go ham, faoi alt 29. Bhéadh fadhb ann, nó cosúlacht faidhbe ann, dá mbéadh duine ag déanamh tráchtaireacta neamhspleácha ar rud a raibh sé tar éis comhairle phearsanta a thabhairt faoi roimhe sin. Mar sin, is fearr i bhfad nach mbeadh aon bhaint ag an gcoimisinéir le hobair na polaitíochta ná nach mbeadh aon bhaint ag polaiteoirí le breithiúnas an choimisinéara agus iad a choinneáil scartha.

Níor mhaith liom go mbeadh duine a raibh baint aige le rudaí náireacha in ann triail a chur ar athló nó an dallamullóg a chur ar an Stát. Mar sin féin caithfear cearta an tsaoránaigh a theastaíonn uaidh an Ghaeilge a úsáid a chosaint, más duine macánta é. Conas is féidir an cheist seo a plé?

Má tógtar mise isteach sa chúirt choiriúil i lár na hoíche beidh ar an gcúirt teangaire a chur ar fáil dom agus an cás a éisteacht i mo rogha theanga. An rud nach mbeidh ar an Stát a dhéanamh ná an cás a thógáil i m'aghaidh i nGaeilge. Is é sin, ní gá go mbeadh Gaeilge ag abhchóide an Stáit. Muna mbeadh, d'fhéadfadh an teangaire Béarla abhchóide an Stáit a aistriú go Gaeilge ar mhaithe liomsa.

Mar is eol don Teachta, tagann cuid des na cásanna seo suas go tobann i lár na hoíche.

          <p eId="para_584">Ní bheidh mé ag cur i gcoinne an Bhille nuair a déanfar vótáil air, cé go bhfuilim amhrasach agus imníoch mar gheall ar alt 32 a bhaint as an Acht. Tá eagla orm go laghdófaí stádas agus gradam an choimisinéara má tabharfar cead do dhaoine dul os comhair na cúirte. Ombudsman de shaghas don Ghaeilge is ea an choimisinéir. Níl cead ag duine dul os comhair na cúirte mar gheall ar chinneadh a dhéanann an Ombudsman. Chomh maith leis sin, de réir alt 31 fanfaidh na dualgais atá ag an Ombudsman go dtí seo faoina bhráid.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go dtabharfaí gach cabhair don choimisinéir chun gradam agus stádas na hoifige a mhéadú agus a fhorbairt chomh luath agus is féidir. Tá eagla orm go dtógfar cásanna maidir le cinnidh an choimisinéara go luath, agus ní rud maith é sin.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Ní bheidh mé ag vótáil i gcoinne an Bhille, ina iomlán. D'oibrigh an t-Aire féin agus oifigigh na Ranna go crua ar an mBille agus thug na hoifigigh in oifig na mBillí an-chabhair do na Baill i gcónaí. Tá an díospóireacht thart anois agus guím gach dea-ghui ar an Acht ina chur i bhfeidhm. Go ndéana sé maitheas don nGaeilge sa Ghaeltacht agus sa ghalltacht.</p>

Dúradh liom sa litir go bhfuil fógraíocht agus stáiseanóireachta an údaráis dhá-theangach. Tá leagan beag bídeach de theideal an údaráis i nGaeilge ar an logo agus an chuid eile go hiomlán i mBéarla. D'ardaigh mé ceist an lá cheana mar gheall ar fhíneálacha parcála agus a leithéid. Dá nglacfadh an t-Aire leis na leasaithe ar an alt seo bheadh rialú déanta aige go han-tapaidh a thabharfadh le fios go mbeidh ar an Stát chóras a chuid foirmeacha, staiseanóireachta agus a leithéid a bheith dhá-theangach.

We have been promised on many occasions that there would be a statutory parole board but we are still operating in an <i>ad hoc</i> way situation.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_603">The question of a parole board was raised on Committee Stage and in the interim the information on the current arrangements was furnished to Deputies Deasy, Costello and Ó Snodaigh. As they are aware, the information confirms that the interim parole board, which replaced the sentence review group, was established in April 2001 by the previous Minister. At the time of the appointment of the interim board, the Minister reiterated his position, that he intended to establish the board on an administrative basis initially, pending statutory provision in due course. It is the intention of the Minister, prior to formulating legislative proposals, to draw on the experience gained in the operation of the board on an administrative basis. That is the position of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The interim parole board is made up of representatives of the Department, the Prison Service and others who represent the interests of prisoners. Accordingly, a proposal to establish a committee as proposed in Deputy Deasy's amendment would amount to duplication of the present arrangement. The amendment, in its expressed terms, seeks to establish a committee on a voluntary basis so it is not the type of statutory foundation that was referred to in the report published yesterday. I appreciate the reasons Opposition Deputies are anxious to flag this proposal. The position of the Minister is that in due course, as experience is gleaned from the operation of the interim board, we can then proceed to establish it on a statutory basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">After yesterday's report, it is crystal clear that the prison system needs comprehensive and fundamental reform. We welcome most of the Bill's provisions as going some way towards addressing issues in the Prison Service. The reason for this amendment is that it is unclear where in the legislation as drafted consideration of temporary release for a prisoner originates. Prisoners themselves should be able to apply for temporary release in addition to the Minister's initiatives, or those of the Director General of the Prison Service and various prison governors. At some stage a prisoner should be able to make an application to be considered for temporary release.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The Minister should establish this application procedure in a transparent way in this Bill and make it generally known throughout the prison population so that a prisoner can apply via an application form within the institution – they should be provided with that. It should also direct the Minister to publish the processing times and the procedures regarding the receipt of such an application. This is particularly important in cases where temporary release is being sought on medical or other humanitarian grounds. The present overly broad and vague discretionary provision is not sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Amendment No. 33, which I have tabled, would help to make this process more transparent and accessible to the prisoner and would enable him or her to get a determination. A prisoner might make an application for temporary release but would only hear back if he or she was granted it for whatever period.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_616">On Committee Stage, Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the need for rules to ensure that a person can make a request for temporary release. The current position is that on being received into prison, a person is given very detailed information on everyday matters which may arise during the course of the person's detention. That information includes details of the circumstances and issues relating to temporary release so that the prisoner is fully aware from the commencement of a term of imprisonment that there is the possibility of temporary release. The prison rules make provision for a person to request to see the governor or a departmental official and concessions and privileges are explained to him or her by various persons in the system, such as the probation and welfare service. There is no need for this amendment and, accordingly, I do not propose to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">It is important to understand in the context of this legislation that we are talking about persons undergoing a sentence of imprisonment and that  the provision of temporary release is not a right but a privilege conceded by the Executive.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_618">The last comment is generally accepted. These people are serving sentences and temporary release would be granted on the grounds set out in the legislation. One does not apply in writing but must go to see the governor. A person has no guarantee that his or her application will be processed on the grounds set out. There should be some way in which a prisoner can make an application which would ensure a determination is made as to whether the prisoner has or has not been granted temporary release, otherwise the prisoner must ask a doctor in the Irish Prison Service, the prison governor or another official. If an application must be made in writing and if there is a specific place in which to lodge it, the prisoner can be sure it is lodged, processed and determined. A prisoner can be refused temporary release on whichever basis outlined by the Minister, or he or she can be granted temporary release because he or she complies with the humanitarian, medical or other grounds set out in the Bill.</p>

Sometimes the application is made and acceded to orally. That information is available and many of the matters into which the Deputy went are matters of practical regime rather than ones which can be laid out in legislation. The Minister does not accept that the issue of a right to make an application should be written into the legislation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_624">In regard to the amendment we just discussed and those we are now discussing, Deputy Ó Snodaigh is trying to improve the situation and to extend the remit of the application so that it could come from the prisoner and a recommendation could be made by the prison governor, the director general of the Irish Prison Service or by the Minister. There would be great access for  people applying for temporary release. Likewise, the number of people designated to grant such release would increase to include the director general of the Irish Prison Service or a prison governor acting on the Minister's behalf as designated by him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">In general, these are desirable amendments which would improve access to temporary release for prisoners in terms of how to apply for it, who would be allowed to apply for it and who could grant it. Given all the burdens on the Minister, he would be able to designate to other appropriately qualified people to assess the requirements. They might be even more qualified than the Minister because of their role in prison administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">When putting together a new structure, or at least new criteria, regarding temporary release, it would be no harm to look at the existing structure under which it is granted, how the prisoner applies, who might apply on his or her behalf and who might be entitled to assess and grant it. A wider structure as opposed to the existing one where the prisoner solely makes the application and where the Minister solely determines it, would be desirable.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_359" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_627">The purpose of this Bill is to set out the criteria which should govern the operation of temporary release and to allow for the transparency we would expect in the exercise of ministerial powers and to lay down clear legislative standards regarding the exercise of ministerial powers in this area. Deputy Ó Snodaigh expressed a concern on Committee Stage that the proposals contained in the Bill might place an onerous duty on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Deputy Costello echoed that sentiment this afternoon but I assure them that the Minister has very broad shoulders.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">Apart from that issue, the Bill simply allows for the current system of temporary release to be put on a more structured, transparent and statutory footing but it must be remembered that persons detained in our prisons and places of detention are detained on foot of court orders. The granting of temporary release is, therefore, a significant and important function which should not be regarded as an operational function which can readily be delegated to other bodies or persons. There is a significant element of risk in the operation of any system of temporary release. The paramount concern must always be the safety of the public. In such matters, responsibility must rest with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He or she is accountable to this House in the exercise of his or her powers and can be taken to account in this House in the event that he or she exercises powers in a way which go beyond proper practice. All of that is protected in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Were we to go down the route of delegating these powers to the governors of prisons or the director general of the Irish Prison Service, we would then be embarking on a route where the  accountability which the Minister has to this House under the legislation is diminished.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_630">The purpose of these amendments is similar to the first one that was rejected, namely, to try to ensure that this facility, which is being put on a statutory basis, is available to prisoners if they meet the criteria. Rather than people having to wait for the Minister to make a decision, he would be able to designate one, two or perhaps more people – in this case, the Director General of the Prison Service or a prison governor – to act on his behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">It is not as though we have a huge number of prison governors, so we are not saying that anybody could overturn or interfere with a court's decision. We must also remember that most people in our prisons are not there for either serious or violent offences. The vast majority of people who would be applying for temporary release would not be a danger to society. The Bill covers eventualities which would prevent those who are such a danger from being granted temporary release. In most cases it would be appropriate that the decisions be dealt with at a lower level than that of the Minister. That is why this responsibility should be delegated downwards so that the Director General of the Prison Service or the prison governors can act on behalf of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">They would be doing so in any event, in that they would obviously be asked for their opinions by the Minister in respect of these prisoners. Why not give them the right to make a determination in these cases? If the case was likely to be controversial, there would be nothing to prevent the prison governor or the Director General of the Prison Service from referring upwards to ensure that the Minister makes the unpopular decisions if they were unhappy about making such a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I reiterate the point I made with regard to those within the prison system and those who would be applying for such a facility. At present, the figures for Irish prisoners show that four out of every ten committals are for less than three months and that six out of every ten are for less than six months. These are not violent criminals or the notorious cases that we see in the papers. Eight out of ten are committed to jail for less than a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The way the Bill is constituted at present means that any of these prisoners who wish to apply for temporary release on the grounds provided in the Bill would have to be dealt with by the Minister. It is a pity that they could not just be dealt with in their place of imprisonment. Most of the governors are well meaning, well in touch with society and accountable to the Minister and the Prisons Service in which they operate. I do not think that, by giving them the additional powers I have requested in this series of amendments, we would be granting leave for anybody or anything in a way that would undermine our judicial system.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_635">First, there is no practical or communication problem on this issue. There is no difficulty in securing instantaneous communication between the various places of detention in prisons and the relevant offices at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There is no practical argument for this form of delegation. It is not essential for practical reasons and these matters can be decided very speedily within the Department. These matters often require to be decided very speedily in the Department when compassionate requests arise in respect of deaths, bereavements or medical emergencies. There is no practical difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">On the issue of principle, I have three objections to the Deputy's proposal. One relates to the question of consistency. It is very important in enacting legislation in an area like this, in respect of which we are laying down standards for the operation of temporary release, that those standards should be applied consistently. That is only fair to prisoners and to those who sentence them. The consistency that is required can best be secured if one body is charged with the responsibility of administering the standards. If we delegate this function to prison governors or to the Director General of the Prisons Service, it is inevitable that divergence of interpretation will arise in different penal institutions. That is undesirable.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">In a matter of this importance, where we are dealing with court orders and a facility that the Executive has to vary and modify a court order in exceptional circumstances, it is desirable that we have a consistent practice and that it is a practice arrived at by a Minister, on advice from his officials, as an external check on the entire matter. It would not be desirable to delegate such a function to an individual officer within the penal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The position of the governors of the different institutions could be compromised by such a proposal because the function of a governor is to act upon the warrant delivered to him or her when taking custody of the detainee. When the custody is received, the governor must act on the warrant, which is a court order commending him or her to hold the detainee. If we introduced into that a facility whereby the governor can simultaneously exercise a power of temporary release, we would, in fact, be putting the governor in a peculiar position in respect of the authority he or she must have in the institution. The governor is the person holding the prisoner and that is his basic function. These are my objections.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to short stay prisoners serving sentences of under six months or three months and said that we are not dealing here with violent criminals. That is not necessarily the case. In many instances, violent criminals do not even end up in prison or serve custodial sentences at all. It is not true to say that people who serve short stay prison sentences are  not necessarily violent criminals. That is not true at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_640">Deputy Deasy is correct, but, in general terms, the majority of those within our prison system are not violent criminals. More so than in any other European country, the majority of them are in prison for non-violent crimes. Many are in for non-payment of fines, etc. In a proper system, they would not be in prison at all. We would have alternative methods of extracting retribution, punishment or whatever society decides.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">One could probably do that if one wished. The point the Minister of State made is quite valid in that consistency is required in sentencing. The Minister of State referred to consistency in granting temporary releases, but if we do not have consistency in the first instance, a person might get a three-month sentence for assaulting somebody in one town but get ten years for doing so in another. That matter needs to be addressed in the long-term. I know that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has great plans to tackle everything and perhaps that might be one of the things he takes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Consistency is also required in terms of prison conditions. The report published yesterday criticises successive Governments in regard to prison conditions. It states that two prisons should be pulled down and rebuilt because they are in such bad condition. The staff quarters in some of the prisons are such that nobody would ask anybody to work in those conditions. I agree with the Minister of State that there is a need for consistency, but we should start to tackle the problems in the prison system. When there is consistency across the board and accommodation is of a similar standard, the availability of educational facilities within prisons, sentencing policy and everything else is consistent, then a prisoner could be told that he or she could not be granted temporary release because there is a standard in place and one cannot break the law. I do not understand why there is a problem in this regard because every one of the prison governors and the director general of the Prison Service are answerable to Departments. If they were granted the powers I propose in my amendment, they would be answerable to the Minister. That is where there is consistency.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I cannot understand why the Department would have to receive a case file and be informed of the reason an individual should be granted temporary release. Such a determination could be made at local level in a better fashion than by an official in the Department who would not have met or have any personal knowledge of the individual concerned and whose decision would be made on the basis of what is written in the case file. At least the prison governor would be aware  of the prisoner and would be closer to those who deal with him or her on a day-to-day basis to enable the governor to make the determination as to whether a prisoner would qualify for temporary release or whether a prisoner's circumstances would require it. A governor would be able to make a judgment quickly on granting a prisoner temporary release on humanitarian grounds if, for example, a prisoner's child was seriously ill in hospital. However, under the legislation a governor would have to refer such a matter to the Department. If a governor wanted to contact the Department after 5 p.m., would the Department be open? A governor could make a decision late at night to grant a prisoner temporary release in the event, for example, of one of a prisoner's parents being on his or her death bed following an accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The Minister of State mentioned overcrowding in the prisons. If a fire broke out in a prison and prisoners were released on that basis, with which I do not fully agree, would a governor have to telephone the Minister who might be on holidays in Majorca or wherever he goes and say that he has to release the prisoners quickly to which the Minister could reply that the governor would have to check with his official and fill out the necessary forms before such releases could be granted? Such a determination should be made at local management level.</p>

          <p eId="para_654">The reasoning behind the Government's amendment is that the slightly more flexible form of wording is to ensure that a record is always kept and that it permits the flexibility that is needed especially at weekends or late in the evening when the direction might, for example, be given orally on the telephone and can later be followed up in writing for record purposes. That is why the formula used by the parliamentary counsel is somewhat more flexible. It also covers an issue raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh on the previous amendment. There is no question of telephoning a Minister on holidays – there is always a duty team available in the Department to deal with these matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_656">In page 3, line 20, after "period," to insert "or during such time or times in the course of a period so specified".</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The purpose of this amendment is to give greater flexibility regarding the temporary release of prisoners by specifying beyond a temporary period to periods in terms of release on a day-to-day basis or a prisoner could be released to go to a job, to attend a course and such release could be granted over a phased period rather than for a specific period as stated in the Bill. Such temporary period is all that is stated in the legislation. Some flexibility is required to meet the needs of prisoners on temporary release.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">When one considers the criteria for qualifying for temporary release, one of the major considerations is rehabilitation. There needs to be some link between a prisoner serving a sentence in a prison and that prisoner being released into the community. A former High Court judge, Mr. Justice Kinlen, who released a report today on prisons was critical of the manner in which people are released from prison and about the fact that there is no structure in place to ensure that the necessary resources were put in place in this regard. As he put it, a prisoner could be released with perhaps €60 in his or her pocket, he or she may have no housing, no roof over his or her head and there was no proper link with the community in respect of that person. If prisoners are to be released, there should be preparation for such release. Such release should not be covered under one specified period, rather it should be over a period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">This is also envisaged in the report of the National Economic and Social Forum which provides that the process of imprisonment is a continuum, that a sentence management plan should be put in place and that from the induction of a person into prison a multifaceted team should meet and agree with a prisoner a particular approach right through that prisoner's time in prison in terms of what he or she would do for the duration of his or her time in prison and that a structure would be put in place for that prisoner's  release. Such a structure would give a more meaningful direction to a prisoner serving a term in prison than what is in place at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">All that is reflected in the criticism by the first inspector of prisons. The initial inspectorate which existed up to 1928 was abolished. After 75 years we have the first independent inspector inspecting our prisons. What he has revealed is eye-opening in terms of the appalling degree of inadequacy in the operation of the prisons. Imagine asking that two prisons be closed and criticising prisons right across the board for inhumane conditions by and large and a total absence of structure and direction. If we are going to introduce on a legislative basis the conditions and criteria on which we release prisoners, such provisions must be incorporated into the overall plan for the prisoner. We should provide greater flexibility in the manner in which prisoners would be released by not limiting temporary release to a single period but rather basing it on a broader criterion of a number of periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The Minister of State's predecessor who was here, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, threw promises about more or less like confetti, that virtually all of the amendments which I tabled would be looked at very seriously for Report Stage. I notice he has looked at only two of them. One of them we will see later. I have a further criticism of the manner in which he has dealt with it. I had thought these amendments would have been accepted and that we would have some action on them at this stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_662">The issue has been reconsidered and examined in depth since the amendment was moved by Deputy Costello. The advice received is that the present wording is effective in allowing for full flexibility in determining the times and periods for which temporary release is granted. I emphasise the plural in those terms. That may be put on the record of the House – the times and periods. We are satisfied that the wording will provide for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The person may be on a temporary release for a period of a number of days, or on a day to day basis for a number of hours. The wording contained in section 1 which amends section 2(1) and reads "Subject to such conditions as may be specified in the direction or rules under this section applying to that person."  Those words are permissive and empower the Minister to deal with this matter. I do not accept that the amendment moved by the Deputy gives any added value to the text of the Bill, and may lead only to confusion. For those reasons I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

We had this discussion earlier on about "period" and "condition" being two totally separate expressions. "Period" refers to time  while "condition" refers to the circumstances under which somebody is released. One needs to extend the periods, so that it must be for more than one period or for an extended phased period –"periodic" might be a better word. To my mind, conditions do not adequately cover a time category, which is different from a condition category.</p>

It would either be gender-proofing in the Criminal Justice Act 1960 being brought into line with the new legislation, or this legislation being brought into line with the Criminal Justice Act 1960. The Minister does not seem to have done that. It is a bit disappointing that the Minister did not deliver somewhat on his promise in this respect, because he seemed to be extremely happy with the need for gender-proofing.

The idea was that we would  have taken the opportunity at this stage to ensure that a Bill passed in another era, in 1960, would be brought up to date and gender-proofed. It is a pity it is not being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I am aware that there could be problems if these amendments were passed on their own. The Minister explained that.

          <p eId="para_678">The purpose of these amendments is to avoid reference to the masculine gender in the Bill, and I can well understand the motivation of the Deputies in tabling the amendments. Where the purpose of the legislation is to amend older legislation, such as in this case, amendments are drafted in the same gender as the original Act. The 1960 Act which the Bill amends was drafted in the masculine gender, hence the use of "him" and "his" in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The matter was discussed in committee, but the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has been consulted again on the issue, and its strong advice is that to go down this road would create a huge additional work load, which would have huge resource implications for all legislation. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has pointed out that in any legislation which amends pre-1993 legislation, its practice is to use the same gender as is used in the original Act. This approach applies equally to both genders. In any event, as already indicated to Deputy Costello in committee, the Interpretation Acts of 1937 and 1993 provide that in every Act, every word importing the masculine or feminine gender, unless the contrary intention appears, is construed as applying to the other gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">An issue of this kind is primarily a matter for the professional judgment of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be guided by that advice.

All legislation should be gender-proofed, and it should not be beyond the competency and the capability of the Minister of State's officials in his Department.

          <p eId="para_687">The capacity question here does not relate to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, but to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. We must take that office's advice as paramount. Every day on the Order of Business, Deputies press for legislation and we all know how much urgent legislation is required. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that were we to introduce this requirement for all pre-1993 legislation, which is what we would do if we went down this road, we would put a huge strain on its capacity.</p>

          <p eId="para_689">In page 3, line 29, after "Síochána" to insert "or any other authority concerned in the enforcement of the law, including an authority of another jurisdiction,".</p>
          <p eId="para_690">One of the conditions for temporary release is that the prisoner would assist the Garda Síochána  in the prevention, detection or investigation of an offence or the apprehension of a person who is guilty of an offence or suspected of having committed an offence. I propose that we extend this beyond the Garda Síochána. Not only could they assist the Garda Síochána, but also other police forces. For example they could be of assistance to Europol or to the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">We spend considerable time in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality Defence and Women's Rights scrutinising European legislation and Framework Documents. As part of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> we co-operate with police forces in other European countries. Crime is no longer a domestic issue – if it ever really was – and is now more international. Specific relationships have been established on a structured basis between police forces right across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">This amendment will give the Minister more flexibility and will allow for a greater use of this criterion for temporary release of prisoners, which would be beneficial to the State in the long-term. If it could assist in the apprehension of other people who are guilty, the Minister should accept my amendment and insert this clause.</p>

          <p eId="para_693">I disagree with the Deputy on this amendment. If other law enforcement authorities wish to do so, they could proceed through the Garda Síochána. This amendment would set a dangerous precedent and we should not go down that road. The police force of the State is the Garda Síochána. In the future, when we have a single police force on this island, requests from other police forces, including Europol, should be made through the Garda.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_695">There are two elements to the Deputy's proposed amendment. The first is for a person to be allowed temporary release to an enforcement authority other than the Garda and the second is for the person to be made available for foreign law enforcement authorities. The Garda Síochána has overall jurisdiction in the prevention, detection or investigation of offences and to accept this amendment might only serve to add confusion. The Garda, as the primary body with responsibility for prosecuting criminal offences, would expect to be asked for assistance by any other bodies that might require its assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">As regards the issue of making the person available for the purpose of investigations that involve another jurisdiction, procedures are already in existence for mutual assistance under the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to cater for such circumstances and those procedures are contained in section 53 of that Act. That provision will be supplemented with the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Bill, which will give  effect to a number of EU instruments and a Council of Europe agreement relating to mutual assistance. The Bill is in the course of preparation at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">These EU and Council of Europe instruments contain provisions in respect of the temporary transfer of detained persons to other States or territories to assist in investigations, which will allow for temporary release to assist with investigations in another jurisdiction where the prisoner has not consented. At present, the prisoner's consent is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Deputy Costello has suggested that it is preferable to keep all maters relating to temporary release in one item of legislation. However, where another jurisdiction is involved in a request for temporary release of a prisoner to its territory, the appropriate place for such provisions is in legislation relating to mutual assistance. Arrangements for mutual assistance are agreed in a treaty. The safeguards and procedures that apply to such mutual assistance and the transfer of the prisoner are contained in that treaty. It is desirable that the terms of that be incorporated in the relevant municipal legislation for the protection of all the interests involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">I do not agree with the Minister of State. I do not see any reason for not having grounds for allowing somebody to be released to assist the Garda Síochána or any other authority concerned in the enforcement of the law. What happens in respect of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, which operates independently of the Garda and which might need assistance in dealing with offences?</p>
          <p eId="para_701">There is no reason not to have mutual agreements with other countries in the European Union, as is the case at present, and at the same time have the totality of criteria here in this single Bill covering temporary release. That was what was intended and it was what the Attorney General requested in 2000, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that we had a proper legislative underpinning for the temporary release of prisoners.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">I tabled this amendment to save the Minister some blushes. The section states that the prisoner may be released:</p>

          <p eId="para_711">I always understood that prisoners were sentenced to ensure good order in society. If we are now to release prisoners in order that one can ensure the good governance of the prison and maintain good order, it turns the whole purpose of imprisonment on its head. The Minister of State will be a laughing stock if it gets into the public domain that this is one of the reasons for releasing prisoners. I am giving him a way out by introducing a more flexible structure. Paragraph (<i>c</i>) of this amendment would replace the existing section to state “where in the opinion of the Minister the temporary release of the person would be in the interests of public policy”. Acceptance of this amendment might save the Minister of State's blushes.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">‘H. The Tribunal shall consist of not more than three members as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_722">(<i>b</i>) His Honour Judge Gerald Keys, from a date to be specified by instrument made pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002 by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I. His Honour Judge Alan Mahon shall be the Chairperson of the Tribunal from a date to be specified by instrument made pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002 by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.'.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I have received a request dated 27 June 2003, from the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters and payments, for amendment of the instruments establishing and appointing the tribunal further to the provisions of section 1(A)(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921, as amended. I note that the tribunal is satisfied – as am I – that the proposed amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Having considered the request I now propose, subject to the passing of the necessary resolutions in the Dáil and Seanad, to amend the existing instruments in compliance with the tribunal's request. This is pursuant to the statutory mechanism set down for changing the membership and chairmanship of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The purpose of this resolution is to reconstitute the membership of the tribunal and ensure it will be able to get back into public session immediately. The resolution proposes that Judge Alan Mahon, who is an existing member of the tribunal, will be appointed as chairperson and that Judge Gerald Keys, who is currently the reserve member, will be appointed as a full member.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">When resolutions have been passed by both Houses, I will make an instrument under the Tribunals of Inquiries (Evidence) Acts 1921 to 2002 to give full effect to the new membership. At that stage, the membership of the three person tribunal will be Judge Alan Mahon, chairperson; Judge Mary Faherty; and Judge Gerald Keys.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The need for this resolution arises from the resignation of Mr. Justice Feargus Flood as both chairperson and member of the tribunal. At the outset, I pay tribute to Mr. Justice Flood for the exemplary manner in which he has discharged his duties, initially as sole member, and more recently as chairperson of the three member tribunal. When Mr. Justice Flood took on the task of investigating allegations of corruption in the planning process in 1997, neither he nor the Government expected that the work of the tribunal would be still under way six years later. During that period, he made a sustained and dedicated contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The resignation of Mr. Justice Flood is, in many respects, the end of an era. As the Taoiseach noted, his name will be synonymous with the will and determination of the Dáil, the Seanad and the Irish people to expose and root out malpractice and corruption. This of itself is a significant contribution by him to Irish political history. One has only to look at the public response to his second interim report, published last year, to have an appreciation of the esteem in which Mr. Justice Flood is held by the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">In recent days, some controversy has arisen about the events leading to the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood and when the Dáil and Seanad should have been informed. I would like to put the facts on the record of the House. On 26 May there was a meeting, at the request of the tribunal, with Mr. Justice Flood, Judges Mahon and Faherty and the Attorney General concerning Mr. Justice Flood's staying on as an ordinary member of the tribunal and the costs issue being decided by Judge Mahon.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">On 28 May, Mr. Justice Flood wrote to the Attorney General indicating, for reasons set out in that letter, that he considered himself to be unable to continue to act as chairperson but that he considered he could continue as an ordinary member. He asked the Attorney General to arrange to have the Oireachtas and myself informed. The Taoiseach and I were given a copy of that letter. The Attorney General responded on 30 May to Mr. Justice Flood asking whether he wanted a copy of the letter circulated or whether he wanted the Attorney General to simply apprise the Oireachtas of the contents.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">On 30 May, counsel for the tribunal requested the Attorney General not to circulate the letter for the reasons stated yesterday by the Taoiseach. On 4 June, Mr. Justice Flood wrote to the Attorney General saying he would shortly send a letter, concerning his intention to step down as chairperson, for circulation to the Clerks of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">By letter dated 16 June, received late on 17 June, Mr. Justice Flood formally confirmed to the Attorney General that he considered himself unable to continue to act as chairperson and asked that a copy of his letter be sent to the Clerks of both Houses of the Oireachtas. This letter was forwarded to me by the Attorney Gen eral, by letter of 18 June, in which the Attorney General indicated that he felt it would be proper procedure for me, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to send the letter to both Clerks. He agreed this changed procedure with counsel for the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">When a copy of the letter of 16 June was received by me, I decided that it should be brought to the Government's attention at the earliest opportunity. At the next Government meeting, on 24 June, the Government considered the letter in the presence of the Attorney General and decided on the lines of the response which I should make on its behalf to the chairperson. At the same time as I replied to the chairperson, I arranged to forward a copy of his letter to the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">My letter of 24 June to Mr. Justice Flood raised several issues. I indicated that we considered it preferable if he were in a position to remain as chairperson to decide the question of costs. I also expressed the view that concerns exist as to the prospects of legal challenges to future reports of the tribunal, in the light of the contents of his letter of 16 June and his continued involvement as an ordinary member. I asked Mr. Justice Flood to address the risk of legal proceedings to a report produced by a tribunal while he was a member. In doing so, I was addressing the following issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">It was our concern that if Mr. Justice Flood continued on, as an ordinary member, hearing modules, over a lengthy period of time, that any subsequent report could be challenged. What we were seeking to elicit from the tribunal was the nature of risk of such a legal challenge in the context of the length of the proposed modules Mr. Justice Flood would be hearing as an ordinary member. Our concern was simple. It was that those who were determined to challenge a subsequent report of the tribunal would rely upon the fact that Mr. Justice Flood had not heard the costs issue but was willing to decide issues relating to corruption and bribery. We were seeking clarification on this potential problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">On 26 June 2003, a meeting took place between the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Flood. This meeting had been sought by Mr. Justice Flood to clarify his position. He stated that he was personally disposed towards dealing with the issue of costs and indeed to continue on in the tribunal for a further period. He stated his willingness to address the costs issue, notwithstanding the added strains and burden that it would impose. There was also a brief discussion about possible future legislative changes to enable the administrative burden of the tribunal that was placed on a chairperson to be reduced by permitting the administrative tasks of the chairperson to be delegated to another member of the tribunal. This was to address one of the reasons behind the proposal contained in the letter of 16 June 2003 and was a mechanism that would assist his continuation in the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">It was agreed that Mr. Justice Flood would return to the tribunal offices for the purpose of sending a letter to the Oireachtas regarding this future role in the tribunal as discussed with the Attorney General. I was informed by the Attorney General of this new situation. Later that afternoon he received a telephone call from Mr. Justice Flood who was at the tribunal. During that call, the Attorney General was informed by Mr. Justice Flood that he then wanted to reconsider his future role in the tribunal having had further discussions. It was also agreed that there would be further consideration of his position overnight by Mr. Justice Flood. I was informed of this change in circumstances by the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">On the morning of Friday, 27 June 2003, the Attorney General received a telephone call wherein he was informed that Mr. Justice Flood was resigning from the tribunal. A letter was then sent to the Oireachtas and copied to the Attorney General. Members of this House have also received a copy of that letter. There was only one meeting last week between the Attorney General and Mr. Justice Flood.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">I received a letter from Mr. Justice Flood on Friday, 27 June in which he indicated that, having reflected on the matter, and in the interests of the tribunal and its very important work to date and into the future, he had decided to resign with immediate effect as chairperson and member of the tribunal. Mr. Justice Flood also sent this letter on the same day to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">I want to make a final point on the question of withholding information. Yesterday in the House, Deputy Rabbitte said that I had informed the House that no changes were proposed to the planning tribunal on 17 June long after discussions were initiated following the original letter from Mr. Justice Flood. In fact, I was not in the House on the day and the Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, replied on my behalf. Had Deputy Rabbitte read the question he would have seen that it was in fact answered correctly. The question asked if I was considering seeking the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas for a change to the mandate, terms of reference or method of inquiry of the planning tribunal. As the House is aware, there is no proposal to change the mandate or method of inquiry of the planning inquiry. It was only last Friday, 27 June, ten days after the question was answered, that I received a request from Judge Mahon and Judge Faherty to reconstitute the membership of the tribunal which triggered today's resolution. These are the facts, which clearly show that, neither now nor in the past, was there any conspiracy to withhold information from the Oireachtas. I hope the matter can rest there and the bona fides of the Government will be accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Government has also been accused of attempting to frustrate the work of the tribunal  by delaying last year in appointing additional members. Again, this is not the case. The allegation is totally unfounded. Resolutions to allow for the appointment of additional members were passed by the Dáil and Seanad on 28 March 2002. To give effect to those resolutions, it was necessary for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make an instrument under the tribunals of inquiry Acts to formally appoint the new members. The tribunal, however, specifically requested in May 2002 that such an instrument should not be made until after Mr. Justice Flood had submitted his interim report to the Oireachtas. The interim report on the first three modules was finalised by him and submitted to the Oireachtas on 26 September 2002. I signed an instrument four weeks later extending the tribunal to a three-person tribunal with a reserve member.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The allegations of attempts to frustrate the tribunal were also scotched when Mr. Justice Flood wrote to the Taoiseach on 30 June confirming that all such allegations were completely groundless. The Taoiseach read that letter into the record of the House on Tuesday. I propose to do so again:</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Dear Taoiseach,</p>
          <p eId="para_745">I refer to my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen on the above matter in which the reasons underlining my resignation are set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">I note in the public press statements to the effect that action-inaction by the Government in relation to requests from the tribunal for additional judges or other matters have caused frustration and are the real reason for my resignation.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I wish to state categorically that this is not so. My decision is in no way related to or consequent upon any action or inaction by the Government of any kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">My relationship with the Government is through the Department of the Attorney General. I have at all times during my tenure of office had a relationship with the Attorney General's Office that has been exceptionally cordial and co-operative. The allegation that the work of the tribunal has been delayed or frustrated in any way by the Government is completely groundless and has nothing to do with my decision to resign.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The reasons for my resignation are solely set out in my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen. I trust this letter clarifies the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Yours sincerely,</p>
          <p eId="para_751">Feargus M. Flood.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The second interim report was a highly significant contribution to Irish public and political life. The tribunal's findings on the modules completed to date were unambiguous and show the thoroughness with which the tribunal carried out its investigations. Mr. Justice Flood sent out a very clear  message to anyone who has any corrupt dealings, or is contemplating such dealings in relation to the planning system, that they will not get away with it. While significant work has been carried out by the tribunal, it clearly has much more to do. When I wrote to the tribunal on 24 June, I also asked for a report dealing with the following matters: the likely duration of the current module or modules; the likely duration, up to completion, of all matters arising within the terms of reference, as amended, of the tribunal; the total in legal costs claimed to date by third parties, that is, those who sought representation or provided discovery and so forth; and the likely costs to be incurred in investigating all matters within the terms of reference. I sought this information for the benefit of the Oireachtas in dealing with consideration of the resolution. The tribunal responded to me on 25 June. Regarding the future duration of the tribunal, it indicated that it is in the course of hearing evidence in public on a number of interlinked planning modules. It is the intention of the tribunal to conclude the public hearings relating to these modules by the end of 2006, after which the tribunal will furnish a report on allegations of planning corruption in the Dublin area to the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">It is also the tribunal's intention that its report will make recommendations as to how any matters then outstanding might best be dealt with, having regard to the tribunal's obligations and experience and any legislative changes in the meantime. The tribunal also indicated that the duration of the tribunal beyond 2006 will depend upon the number of issues, if any, deemed to merit public inquiry. The tribunal is currently investigating a number of issues in private but no decision has been taken as to whether any of these issues require public hearing. It is anticipated that within the next 12 months the tribunal will be in a position to decide whether any of the issues should be heard in public and, at that time, the tribunal will be in a position to advise me, and the Oireachtas, of the likely duration of the public hearings relating to any such issue. The full texts of that letter and my letter of 24 June were sent to the Clerks of both the Dáil and Seanad on 27 June. It is clear from that correspondence that the tribunal still has significant work to do. In light of the likely duration, it is understandable that Mr. Justice Flood could not be expected to finalise the work of the tribunal as chairperson and his resignation must be viewed in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The decision taken last year to appoint a reserve member allows for a smooth transition to a newly constituted tribunal. The proposal is to appoint an existing member as chairperson and to make the reserve member a full member. I do not propose to appoint a new reserve member at this stage and none has been sought by the tribunal as it would not be practical given that a current module is in mid-stream. If the tribunal  makes such a request at any stage in the future, I will bring the matter before the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Before concluding, I want to refer to the question of who will determine costs on modules to date. As I indicated, it was our preference that Mr. Justice Flood would deal with the matter. The resignation of Mr. Justice Flood means it must be dealt with by another person. This raises legal issues regarding hearings to determine the issue of costs in respect of modules of the tribunal completed to date. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will arrange for new legislation in the autumn to deal with this issue. Pending such legislation, hearings on costs will not take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">I reaffirm the commitment of the Government to the completion of the inquiry into certain planning matters and payments. The speed with which this resolution was brought to the Dáil gives an indication of the commitment to the future work of the tribunal. The members of the tribunal are persons of the highest calibre and integrity and this tribunal will continue with the same persistence and determination as was demonstrated by Mr. Justice Flood. The members of the tribunal, with their legal team and staff, will be supported in full in their determination to establish whether any corrupt practices exist, or have existed, in our planning system and to report without fear or favour on the outcome of the inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">I commend the resolution to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_759">I am happy to address the resolution to amend the terms of reference of the tribunal of inquiry into certain planning matters and payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">I pay public tribute to Mr. Justice Feargus Flood for his conduct and the efficiency with which he brought forward his interim report. As I previously said, this report has set a standard for tribunals in terms of its forthrightness and clarity. It is important that this be borne in mind when one considers this matter has been ongoing for six years. The thoroughness of his investigation and the clarity of the language used in his report, rid us forever of the notion that some in our society are above the law. He has set the record and the standard for all other tribunals. He has left us in no doubt that when it comes to the most important business of this country – the public business – there must be only truth, told willingly, wholly and on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The Flood tribunal is the people's tribunal; it is not the Government's tribunal and it does not belong to the Fianna Fáil Party or the Progressive Democrats. It was set up by the Houses of the Oireachtas to lay bare the corruption we now know was endemic in certain sections of political life and in one in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">There has been a tendency in the language used by the Taoiseach to claim ownership of the tribunal to an extent. That is also evident in the  legislation published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This party welcomes measures which will deliver investigations that are effective, efficient and have the confidence of the public. It is essential that the primacy of the Oireachtas, not the Executive, in establishing investigations, is maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">I am somewhat confused as to the reasons the Taoiseach handled this matter in the way he did. He has behaved as if the new legislative model is already in place. He has given the impression, at least to some, that this is not his tribunal but rather the people's and therefore more public accountability in its workings and not less is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">In June 2001, an overworked Mr. Justice Flood requested more judges. These were not appointed until March 2002. No public hearings were held before the general election. On May 26, the Attorney General met Mr. Justice Flood, Judge Mahon and Judge Faherty to discuss Mr. Justice Flood's desire to step down. Mr. Justice Flood announced on Bloomsday that he was writing to the Attorney General announcing his wish to step down as chair but to remain as an ordinary member.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">What confuses me is that, presumably, the Attorney General would have conveyed this news to the Government and to the Taoiseach. Yet on 24 June, when the Taoiseach came to the House to answer questions regarding the Moriarty tribunal, the Ceann Comhairle at first went to rule out the business of the Flood tribunal and the Taoiseach announced with an air of great surprise that he had just been informed of Mr. Justice Flood's decision. I do not understand why the air was not cleared in the House in the beginning. I am not suggesting the Taoiseach knew something he should have told the House other than that he should have said to the House: "I have this information. I have known it for over a month and it is not news to me to read it out here on 24 June".</p>
          <p eId="para_766">There is a difference of opinion between the Taoiseach saying that it is his view that the tribunal will sit for a further 15 years and the tribunal and its teams saying that the work would be completed by 2006. The Taoiseach in the House volunteered to share his legal advice and not only that, but "to take whatever steps are necessary, as expeditiously as possible to ensure that future determinations of the tribunal are valid and legally sustainable". He also stated that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's new legislation will "not apply to existing tribunals". Yet he told Deputy Rabbitte that the idea of putting the Flood modules under the new system would be "eminently sensible." That is a little like the muddled thinking that applied in the investigation of the former Minister, Ray Burke, the man who was described as the man "who betrayed us and let us down", but who shortly before was "a good man hounded out of office by rumour and innuendo."</p>
          <p eId="para_767">By July 1 the Taoiseach was still maintaining that when he made his announcement on 24 May, he had only received the information a few hours earlier. That is not true. Either the Attorney General told the Taoiseach and the Government when he had the meeting in regard to Mr. Justice Flood in the first instance or he did not. There was almost a month in which the Taoiseach could have informed the House or the party leaders of the information in his possession. He then reiterated his commitment to make correspondence available and for whatever reason, it was only delivered to certain sections of the media and not to any of the representatives of the people. I know the Taoiseach apologised to the House for that but these things should not happen on sensitive issues such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The mishandling of the affairs of the tribunal is also evident in the issue of costs. The Government has promised legislation in the autumn which will allow Judge Mahon to deal with the issue of costs. However, the Government has been aware of the need for this legislation for more than six weeks. If there is a sense of urgency as expressed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, why has it not been possible to produce the legislation this week or last week before the House rises for the summer recess? The Members would then have an opportunity to have a full debate on the matter and to offer their comments. I am not aware of any Oireachtas Member who wants to see the workings of this tribunal held back and in fact, the opposite is the case. There is a clear desire expressed by the people that these matters be moved on as expeditiously as possible. There is one clear single fact which emerges from this debate, that under no circumstances does the public want a situation where the taxpayer has to fork out for the costs of those who have been deemed to have deliberately obstructed the workings and investigations of the tribunal, whether those costs be €10,000 or €10 million. The public will not wear that. That gives rise to the possibility of a series of legal challenges because Judge Mahon who will now chair the tribunal will have to read up to 37,000 pages of transcript, understand the nuances of how that information was imparted, the environment in which the events took place and the mood of the day. While the Taoiseach has stated there is no legal impediment to him so doing, it may well be that legal challenges will arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">On a day when the Government has used its majority to guillotine several Bills through this House we can only speculate as to why there was no urgency in the production of this legislation by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, so that it could be at least be dealt with in part before the House resumes business in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">It is essential that we remember that this tribunal is about exposing the contaminated moral environment created by certain people in the  world of politics for decades and which was highlighted by Mr. Justice Flood in his interim report.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">There is serious speculation that some damning evidence against the Taoiseach will be presented at future stages of the tribunal. I have no evidence to substantiate this speculation other than the usual rumour that floats around the country. It is important that we reiterate that the modules dealing with Gilmartin and Quarryvale be held in public. I take the word of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on that. If one was to believe some of the comments, the evidence would, as Deputy Rabbitte said in the House some years ago, rock not just the party but the country to its foundations.</p>

          <p eId="para_776">I also note that the legislation, which will be introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, refers to moving around the different modules. I am not a legal expert, but the legal basis for what he intends to do may be questionable. Is it the case that witnesses, characters, informants and subject matters are so interrelated it would be impossible to identify and surgically dismember some modules from the existing procedure? Having read some of the transcripts of the replies given by Mr. Justice Flood to lawyers who questioned the rights and range of the tribunal, it appears that there is a concept of an overarching tribunal that would cover all the modules and that planning permissions, property issues or issues relating to module 20 might also relate to module 1. There may be serious difficulties if one was to try to shift certain modules into private session in an attempt to speed it up and to reduce costs, which is a principle one can support.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">I do not want to give the impression that it will drift for many years if it is done in public. I will not stand for a situation where people might perceive the party as being corralled into collusion with the Government which could lead people to say that the public's right to information was being denied.</p>

          <p eId="para_778">I would like to make one point. As regards the current modules, the A5 modules, that collective group is before the tribunal. Those modules must be investigated by the tribunal. There is no other way to do it. The A5 group includes the ones before the tribunal. All the others are separate. The A5 group must be in front of the Mahon tribunal, as it will be called after today. A decision has not been made about  all the other modules. The 15 are still there after the A5. A decision has not been made so someone else could take those up.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_779">I thank the Taoiseach for that clarification. I remind the Taoiseach about what Mr. Justice Flood said when he spoke on day 329. He said it was true to say that the entitlement of Mr. O'Higgins to cross-examine on issues which are not covered in this module is deferred, but it is deferred only to the point where the matter will be raised in its own module. He also said that all relevant statements and allegations relating to subsequent modules would be provided to all concerned in advance of subsequent modules and these can be tested in the usual way in the course of subsequent hearings. If the other 15 are separate and can be heard by other people or in a more closed environment and if what Mr. Justice Flood said on day 329 is to apply, then it appears that the information given in those separate modules would have to be made available to the questioners in respect of the first five which have been heard in public. I am concerned that the overarching concept might have to apply in public to all modules instead of the group or groups outlined by the Taoiseach. Mr. Justice Flood's statement on day 329 seems to give that impression.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">It is clear from what Mr. Justice Flood said that the operations and procedures of the tribunal have been predicated upon guarantees and assurances from the tribunal that there will be an opportunity in subsequent modules to cross-examine and test the credibility of people making allegations. What is taking place is a deferral of rights.</p>

If he knew six or seven weeks ago that this legislation was required, I do not understand why he did not introduce it in the House. I do not understand his reasons for flying the kite that the State can exonerate the tribunal from obligations which arise from assurances it gave to counsel appearing before it.

          <p eId="para_787">On behalf of the Labour Party, I am pleased to support the motion in the name of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to appoint his honour Judge Alan Mahon as chairperson of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. I extend our good wishes to Judge Mahon and his colleagues, her honour Judge Mary Faherty and his honour Judge Gerald Keys in the important and demanding tasks that remain to be discharged by this tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I repeat my party's gratitude to Mr. Justice Feargus Flood for the work he completed before his retirement. There is no doubt that the planning tribunal had a shaky start where the difficulties it had with an elderly, dogmatic and somewhat irascible witness were greatly added to as a result of a sustained campaign to undermine its credibility. I do not have any doubt that those responsible for the systematic leaking of information provided to the tribunal in confidence were the parties who had most to lose from the effective and efficient operation of the tribunal, and therefore, had most to gain from the subversion of its reliability and integrity in the eyes of the public. Against that background, Mr. Justice Flood deserves that this House acknowledges that he has done the State some service.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The manner of the departure of Mr. Justice Flood is therefore all the more regrettable. It is genuinely impossible to say why the Taoiseach mishandled Mr. Justice Flood's resignation. Is it merely that the Taoiseach will not permit his left hand to know what his right hand is doing? Did his style of accounting to the House give rise to what lawyers would describe as an "inevitable accident", or is there a grand plan to reconfigure the planning tribunal to partisan advantage? Meanwhile, Deputy Harney has long since ceased worrying about what she does not know or why she was not told. Harney watchers will soon be tracking her movements by the Hubble telescope.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">As Deputy Kenny recited, the Taoiseach knew the chairman of the Flood tribunal planned to resign a full month before he told the Dáil. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, was also kept in the dark. The Taoiseach expressed surprise in this House when he finally told us that Mr. Justice Flood wanted to step down. Reading from a pre-prepared statement, he said: "I have not had an opportunity to study all the legalities in the few hours since I have been made aware of these issues". He has not adequately explained why he kept the information to himself and did not men tion the toing and froing that had been going on since late May, when he finally brought the difficulties with costs to the attention of the House. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government did not, in his letter to Mr. Justice Flood, request him to stay on and adjudicate on costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">He also made it clear that the Government considered that Mr. Justice Flood's remaining on the tribunal as an ordinary member would make every future report from it liable to legal challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">During his contribution, the Minister added to our knowledge by making it patently clear that he regards the tribunal to be the property of the Government, not of the Oireachtas. The Minister received a letter on 16 June which the judge required to be immediately forwarded to the Clerks of both Houses. The Minister did not send it to either, but brought it to the Government. Only eight days later was it sent to the Clerks. Finally, through his own remarks, the Taoiseach allowed concern to grow that, in the absence of Mr. Justice Flood, the taxpayer may be exposed to costs for wealthy interests deemed to have obstructed the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The 1997 amendment initiated at the behest of the Labour Party was intended to have a salutary effect, since the only effective sanction is an award of costs against the offending individual. I believe, however, that we should go further, and not only to protect the public purse. Lawyers and witnesses must have driven home to them the fact that while they argue, hedge, adjourn and prevaricate, the meter is always running. To spend time on one's feet before a judicial tribunal is to spend a scarce and expensive publicly owned resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">A dilatory, lackadaisical or careless approach – and the belief that we have all the time in the world because someone else is paying – are the hallmarks of the party with the deepest pockets. Tolerating such an approach skews procedure for the benefit of those who can best afford to pay the most. Why can the power of the tribunals to tax the costs of parties appearing before them not be redefined to include the power to deduct the cost of time-wasting and red herring-chasing, no matter to whose benefit the ultimate findings of fact may be, and the power to order that the costs of the parties incurred as a result of such tactics should be borne by the time-wasting party?</p>
          <p eId="para_800">The enormous cost of several ongoing tribunals cannot be ignored, particularly while the home help service is being cut and the back to education allowance restricted, not to mention the acute need for intensive care nurses in Crumlin Children's Hospital and elsewhere. We need a cheaper, more economical, more efficient and speedier method of inquiring into matters which, in the public interest, cannot be swept under the carpet. Tax evasion, for example, is not a victimless crime and even the possibility that compliant taxpayers may be liable for the costs of tax evaders in the current case is unthinkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">The Government promises amending legislation to smooth the transition to the chairmanship of Judge Mahon and to enable him to shoulder the costs of adjudication burden. Very large sums of public money are at stake here and the public is entitled to cast-iron assurances from the Government that correct and legally sustainable procedures will be complied with. In the longer term, the Labour Party will constructively examine the proposals of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to protect taxpayers' money. I repeat, however, that we are not prepared to agree to any proposals that would leave uninvestigated serious allegations of wrongdoing already in the public domain or already in the possession of the tribunals.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">The criteria according to which the Commissions of Investigation Bill must be judged are whether it is effective and workable and whether the private process by which reports are to be produced in future will be conducive to public confidence in their findings. In fact, it is a modest enough proposal, a further elaboration of a process that has been developed in recent years. It is forgotten that both the Moriarty and the Flood tribunals had sections of their terms of reference dealing with preliminary investigations. Essentially, the terms of reference permit such a preliminary investigation by the tribunal in private before moving to a consideration of the evidence at its public proceedings. This innovation was not of itself sufficient to control the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Regardless of the merits of the Bill published today, it should be clear, as the Bill itself recognises, that the need for tribunals of inquiry operating under the 1921 Act has not been done away with. There are at least two reasons for this. First, the Salmon report in the UK makes the point that:</p>
          <p eId="para_805">There are, however, exceptional cases in which such [inquisitorial] procedures must be used to preserve the purity and integrity of our public life without which a successful democracy is impossible. It is essential that on the very rare occasions when crises of public confidence occur, the evil, if it exists, shall be  exposed so that it may be rooted out; or if it does not exist, the public shall be satisfied that in reality there is no substance in the prevalent rumours and suspicions by which they have been disturbed. We are satisfied that this would be difficult, if not impossible, without public investigation by a inquisitorial tribunal possessing the powers conferred by the Act of 1921.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">In the sort of circumstances that Salmon described – when a crisis of public confidence occurs – a public inquiry becomes necessary. That is and must remain a choice that the elected representatives of the people are entitled to make, having carefully weighed the relevant factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">That reality is reflected in the Government's response to the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg this week on the Pat Finucane case. The court ruled that the UK Government had failed to investigate adequately allegations that the security forces colluded in the murder of Mr. Finucane. The Taoiseach repeated his previous call for an independent public inquiry. I join with the Taoiseach, the Finucane family, the SDLP and others in restating my own belief that a public inquiry is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">None of us means by that a Government-appointed investigative commission that conducts its work in private and is disabled from resolving any issue where there is conflicting evidence. Due to its subject matter, a report from a body operating along those lines would fail the essential test. The manner in which the report was compiled and produced would not be conducive to public trust in its findings. Second, it is only a tribunal of inquiry appointed by the Government on the authority of the Houses that is empowered by Article 28.4.3º of the Constitution to inquire into discussions at Cabinet meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The argument of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is that tribunal costs – which derive almost entirely from legal representation and which by and large are borne by the taxpayer on behalf of all represented parties – can be reduced if not eliminated where investigations are conducted in private. Ideas along these lines have been suggested for some time and the Minister is to be congratulated for reducing them to concrete proposals. However, while public concern has been growing for several years about the increasing cost of lawyers, the Government has been a very recent convert to this issue. It has been in office for six years but has done virtually nothing to control or reduce legal costs, either in respect of tribunals or in other areas of the law. Indeed, the Minister's principal contribution was to negotiate an €800<i>per diem</i> increase for tribunal lawyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Will the Minister's Bill be used to foreshorten the work of the Mahon tribunal? Under section 3(1) of the Bill he published today, this is a matter for the Government since only the Government may initiate such a referral and only then, presumably, with the assent of the tribunal. The  major question that arises is who would determine what might be referred to the commission for investigation and what would be left to the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I am disappointed that the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order a Labour Party amendment – because it was outside the scope of the motion – that sought to enable the Mahon tribunal, if appropriate, to allow the three judges to sit in parallel where feasible. I regret that this was not allowed to be put to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_816">I merely raised the point for discussion because when many people saw three extra judges being appointed to the tribunal they assumed it was going to speed up. They also assumed that different modules could proceed in parallel and that the work would be done simultaneously but they have been surprised to find that is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">It is clear from the Bill that a report from a commission may, in turn, lead to the subsequent establishment of a full tribunal of inquiry. I am particularly disappointed that the Government appears to have abandoned the option of investigation by an Oireachtas committee where this would be appropriate. The DIRT inquiry completed its public hearings within six weeks and recouped almost €500 million for the Exchequer. It would not be a major task to address, through legislation, the issues raised in the Abbeylara judgment, so that investigation by an Oireachtas committee is available as an economical and effective alternative in appropriate circumstances and as envisaged by the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Not only has the Government not taken any action in this area, it has reneged on the commitment it made to implement the key recommendation contained in the DIRT report on the introduction of legislation to provide for the appointment of parliamentary inspectors. It was envisaged that a parliamentary inspector could be appointed to inquire privately into matters of public concern as a preliminary to a possible Oireachtas inquiry. This was the case with the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in the DIRT inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">On foot of the inspector's report, it would be for the Oireachtas to decide whether to proceed with its public inquiry or to establish an independent tribunal of inquiry. If the Government is serious about establishing a procedure for inquiring into matters of public interest without costing the Exchequer an inordinate amount of money, it is inexplicable that not only has it not dealt with the issues arising from the Abbeylara judgment, but also that it has abandoned the commitment to the parliamentary inspector model.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">It is now time to carry out a review and overhaul of our tribunal legislation in its entirety. In 1997 and 1998, three separate Acts were passed, while last year there was a fourth and in the autumn there will be a fifth such Act. The second 1998 Act repealed and replaced the amendments carried out by the first Act of that year, which, as I have pointed out, was despite our warnings and those of many of my colleagues, that the Government had adopted an incorrect and inadequate approach. We need to abandon such an <i>ad hoc</i> approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">We have had more than enough experience of inquiries and other forms of statutory investigation to make an assessment of the full strengths and faults of the various systems. Learned articles have been written and seminars held, and the bones of a procedure for the future are already apparent. The authors of the legislation under which the Committee of Public Accounts conducted its inquiry into DIRT, put into practice some if not all of the lessons we have learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">There is a need for a two-stage process built into the inquiry system. The legislation published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, attempts to deal only with the first stage of a tribunal of inquiry, which is largely interview and paper trail driven, and takes place in private. That process will be more extensive than it could ever justifiably be in a public forum, with legal representatives of every person with any conceivable interest being in continuous attendance.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">If that process uncovers nothing of concern, that will be an end of the affair. If it reports undisputed facts, it will be for the relevant authorities to act on foot of them. If there are controversies as to the facts, however, and if the issues are of serious public importance, then that process will at least have defined the issues to be dealt with by further action. It should then be a matter for the Houses to determine what, if anything, should follow from the published report. If further inquiry is needed, using powers of compellability, the preferred option for consideration should be a reference to an Oireachtas committee. However, if that proves impossible or undesirable because of the anticipated duration, the parliamentary cycle, the politically contentious nature of the subject matter or any other  reason, then a tribunal of inquiry should be appointed.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">In either event, that second stage would take place in public and uncontested evidence already available would be taken as read. Issues would be narrowed down and the evidence confined to reconciling the conflicts on those issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">It was inappropriate of the Taoiseach to leave the Chamber following the contributions by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The input of the Technical Group is just as relevant to this issue or any other. The Taoiseach has done the House a discourtesy by leaving now.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The motion before us arises from the resignation of Mr. Justice Feargus Flood as chairperson of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. I wish to put on record our appreciation for the work of Mr. Justice Flood, who deserves praise for his conduct of the tribunal. The Flood tribunal has helped to expose much about the corrupt nature of planning in this State over many years. Despite its duration and cost, the tribunal has also ensured the return of much taxation revenue both directly and indirectly as a result of its activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">There are questions to be answered about the circumstances which led to this motion coming before the Dáil. The Oireachtas should have been informed of the matter at least as early as 16 June when the Minister, Deputy Cullen, received the letter from Mr. Justice Flood stating his wish to resign as chairperson of the tribunal. The Government was aware of this from late May, yet we were not informed about it by the Taoiseach until last week, on 24 June. The Taoiseach stated yesterday that, "simply to have circulated the letter would have given rise to wild and damaging speculation that would be contrary to the best interests of the tribunal". I believe the opposite is the case. It is the holding back of information that leads to legitimate speculation. That is why questions have been raised about the handling of this resignation, and it is no wonder, given the action of this Government in gutting the Freedom of Information Act. It cannot expect public trust in the wake of that anti-democratic move.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The Government has indicated that it will have to legislate to ensure that challenges on costs, because of the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood, do not succeed. It seems to be confident that such  legislation will succeed in its purpose. Let us hope so or else we will face the nightmare scenario of the taxpayer paying massive legal costs to some members of the rogues' gallery who have appeared at the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The Government should also introduce separate legislation to properly regulate the exorbitant fees of legal teams involved in tribunals. There is a wider need for fundamental reform of the legal profession and, in particular, the whole area of legal fees and costs. Instead, however, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has published this week his Commissions of Investigation Bill, which provides for private investigations. I am concerned that the Minister and the Government will exploit legitimate public concern over the cost of tribunals, to introduce a process which will go on behind closed doors and will lack the transparency and public accountability that is essential if truth is to be established. For example, new evidence recently emerged on the murder of Sinn Féin councillor, Eddie Fullerton. The events surrounding his murder, collusion by British forces and the role of the Garda Síochána, need to be fully and publicly investigated.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The interim report of the Flood tribunal confirmed that the former Minister, Ray Burke, enriched himself with the help of property speculators and developers, who themselves benefited hugely from the corrupt planning system. When the report was debated here last October, Sinn Féin tabled an amendment calling for the oil and gas exploration licences negotiated and granted by former Minister for Energy and Communications, Ray Burke, to be fully investigated by the tribunal. The Government rejected that amendment but I take this opportunity to call again for a public inquiry into the Corrib gas scandal – one of the greatest rip-offs of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I regret that the Labour Party and the Green Party amendments have been disallowed, because they merited support.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_835">On behalf of the Green Party, I wish Mr. Justice Flood the best of luck in his retirement. He has served the country well and his interim report will be remembered as a model of clarity that set the standard for future tribunal reports. We could speculate at length regarding the reasons he departed the scene and in all such cases conspiracy theories abound, but human factors should never be discounted when such important decisions are made. At 75, he has reached an age when thoughts of one's mortality become more frequent and, perhaps, he arrived at the conclusion that life is too short, even for tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">That does not mean the Government attitude towards the tribunal can be excused. Its approach has been characterised by foot dragging, evasion and delusion. I recall vividly the wrangling over  the terms of reference, the defence of Ray Burke by both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach's memorable statement that we hounded an honourable man out of office. Mr. Burke is not an honourable man and he and others, who deliberately obstructed the work of the tribunal, should not have their costs paid. The introduction of legislation that would avoid such a scenario will have the full support of the Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The notion that Mr. Burke and his ilk could be supported to the tune of €10 million by the taxpayer would be almost enough to send the exasperated public into revolt. It would defeat almost entirely the purpose of the tribunal, which is not only to establish what wrongdoing took place but also to ensure wrongdoers are punished in some shape or form. The people demand no less. Public odium is not sufficient punishment for those thick skinned and greedy individuals. Their motivation in engaging in corrupt practices was money and it is through monetary penalties that they can adequately be brought to heel. I am glad the Minister will introduce legislation in this regard in the autumn. I look forward to that and it will have the support of my party.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The Government spin doctors are suggesting this is further evidence the tribunals are a waste of money and a number of irresponsible Ministers have added fuel to the fire by suggesting the tribunal could take up to 15 years to complete its work. If the work is organised properly, it could be completed in a much shorter time. The work of the Committee of Public Accounts, under the late Deputy Jim Mitchell, stands as a shining example in this regard. It is possible to carry out a thorough investigation at a fraction of the cost if the political will is there.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The difference between the Public Accounts Committee and the main representatives at the tribunal is the latter belong to the legal profession, which believes its extraordinary gifts require extraordinary remuneration. It was once said, jokingly, that the primary talent required of a barrister is the ability to keep a straight face when he is handing the bill to a client. While the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, may not agree, stories are emerging of junior counsel paying off their mortgages on the strength of their work at the tribunal. While these stories may be apocryphal, the legal fees charged at the tribunal are scandalous and in general the legal profession needs to be sorted out. The late Noel Browne said when he entered the House he was told "you should leave the law alone". Given the background of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the law is in safe hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">The Government has not learned much from the tribunal. Last week we introduced a Private Member's Bill relating to the implementation of the Kenny report, which would have ensured the corrupt practices that were witnessed would no  longer take place. Our Bill was taken in the House and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government did not even have the courtesy to turn up.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">Following six years of the Flood tribunal, it remains essential that all allegations of corruption should be fully and openly investigated, exposed and addressed. Having spent so much time unveiling a range of allegations of corruption, the tribunal must be get on with and complete its work. I trust there will be no attempt to curtail the investigations or to conduct private hearings to deal with the essential work of exposing corruption. If that were to happen, it would be welcomed only by those who have something to hide and who wish to avoid public examination of their activities and financial interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">One of the reasons the process has taken so long is the tribunal has had so many allegations of corruption with which to contend. The scale of corruption that has been revealed requires that all allegations should be fully investigated and dealt with transparently. This can be done at the same time as confronting the appalling scandal of the fees paid to members of the legal profession at the tribunal. Their greed has undoubtedly added a tier of scandal in the public mind and it is so outrageous that it is in danger of undermining the entire process. There will be unprecedented public outrage if the taxpayer ends up paying the significant costs of builders and politicians who have been found to have made and received corrupt payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">While this issue and the issue of obscene payments to the legal profession must be addressed, sight cannot be lost of the main enemy – those who have amassed millions by corrupting the planning and political systems, whether they were businessmen, lobbyists or politicians. It is only in this way that corruption can be finally rooted out.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">I was a strong advocate in 1997 of the need to investigate the corruption that was manifest in the planning process through the relationship between landowners, speculators and  certain politicians. That arose from my experience as a member of Dublin County Council during the development plan process in the early 1990s. The corridors of the council building resembled a wild west saloon when the ranchers and the cowboys hit town, the difference being that in the mythical old west, they did so after hitting pay day having done a great deal of hard work.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_849">The gangs of Dublin county hit the council in anticipation of the massive pay day that would accrue if councillors zoned land for housing and industry, irrespective of the planning arguments. They then would go on to orchestrate the obscene speculation, as a result of which the price of building land increased relentlessly to satisfy the speculator's greed. Young people who tried to furnish themselves with a home paid and continue to pay for this greed through the quadrupling of house prices in the greater Dublin area and corresponding increases in other regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">No effective action has been taken by the Government. The speculator's greed was realised courtesy of Fianna Fáil councillors and those representing Fine Gael, with one or two exceptions, when the real life saloon up the road from the council building, Conways pub, emptied peremptorily following telephone calls from party whips. Councillors rushed to the chamber, with the stench of brandy and cigars preceding them, to vote in favour of rezoning motions. They never participated in the discussions on the motions and for the most part they knew nothing about the land concerned. We suspected then, but did not know, that the bulges in their breast pockets were brown paper envelopes given to them in Conways by the bagmen for the landowners and speculators to buy their votes. The parties concerned knew very well this had been going on for years but did nothing to stop it. The Government still fails to bring in legislation to outlaw speculation in building land.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The corruption must be investigated. Those investigations must continue and the truth must out. It is unfortunate that the tribunals themselves are now the occasion for the manifestation of another kind of greed. The fantastic fees demanded by leading barristers will soon see more millionaires presiding as lawyers at the tribunal than the sum total of rogue millionaires that they are investigating. That is a source of anger and scandal for compliant taxpayers, such as those householders the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government thinks he can bludgeon into giving up their bin tax protest. The Minister and the Taoiseach will regret that as those people's anger will be fuelled further by what is going on in the tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">The Government refuses point blank to take on the greed of the legal profession, unlike its approach to low paid public service workers, carers and the weak. I reluctantly support today's amendment because the tribunals are dragging on too long. I do not understand why they cannot be foreshortened, with competent investigators doing the background work. Those charged could then be brought in and the charges put to them. They can have a chance to answer and then a verdict can be reached. It happens in the District and Circuit Courts every day of the week. Why does this have to go on for years?</p>

          <from>Ms O'Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_853">I commend the resolution to the House on behalf of the Progressive Democrats. We have had tribunals of inquiry now as a constant backdrop to political and public life for more than ten years. At times it appears they operate in a parallel universe to the Dáil, which begat them. Some say there is now tribunal fatigue, while others say tribunal costs now outweigh the benefits. However, most people agree that the tribunals were very necessary and remain necessary. The tribunals, and particularly the one we are discussing today, have done a vital job to expose corruption and dishonesty in public life. They have done what the Dáil had failed to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">People hope our public life is better off as a result of the clear light that has been cast on previously obscure and forbidden zones of political careers and private enrichment, as I believe. I record the appreciation of my party for the work Mr. Justice Flood has done since the inception of the tribunal of inquiry into planning matters in November 1997, so long ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The interim report the tribunal produced last September was a critical contribution to ensuring that wrongdoing and corruption could not remain, as before, veiled from public view and unchecked by the arms of the State, in particular in this case by the Oireachtas. Rather than tribunals bringing politics into disrepute, they have helped create a climate where honesty in public life is finally becoming a basic requirement that people will be held to. What the planning tribunal and others have exposed is not that political life here is itself corrupt and dishonest, which would be wrong, but that certain individual politicians normalised corruption and dishonesty in their political life and in their dealings with this House and with the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">It is vital that we do not forget the central findings of the tribunal in its interim report. It is vital we remember how important it was to this House and to the public that the findings should have directly concerned a former Minister for Foreign Affairs who grossly misled this House. In its interim report published last September, the tribunal referred to its amended terms of reference and stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The Tribunal was obliged to investigate the entire public life of Mr. Burke from 1967 to 1997 to see whether any substantial payments were made or benefits provided to him which, in the opinion of the Tribunal, amounted to corruption, or involved attempts to influence or compromise the disinterested performance of public duties, or were made or provided in circumstances which may give rise to the reasonable inference that the motive for making or receiving such payments was improperly connected with any public office or position held by him, whether as Minister, Minister of State, or elected representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The tribunal said it was able "to pronounce with finality" upon certain payments made to Mr. Burke. So, did Mr. Burke receive corrupt payments? Yes he did. Did he act for private interests while in public office? Yes he did. Did he lie to the tribunal? Yes he did.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The public has made up its mind about Mr. Burke, about the politics he indulged in, and about the political culture from which he came. The findings of the tribunal performed a valuable service in bluntly calling a spade a spade after the most detailed and methodical inquiry. It would appear Mr. Burke cares little for the findings of the tribunal, for the Oireachtas or for the court of public opinion. Is it any surprise therefore that, according to reports, the highest costs contested and sought from this tribunal established by the Oireachtas are from a man who misled the Dáil and who has been found by the tribunal to have behaved wrongly and corruptly? The brazenness, the bluster and the bombast are familiar. We may be appalled but what really matters is that it ought not be allowed to work, as it clearly did in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">I note newspaper reports from what are described as "close family sources" that Mr. Justice Flood based his decision to resign now as chairman on the belief that the costs issue was likely to drag on for several years with "some parties likely to challenge his integrity, fitness and decision-making". We all know and accept that it is a normal part of our adversarial justice system that judgments are appealed on whatever grounds lawyers can bring forward: matters of law, matters of fact, due process, and sometimes even potential conflicts a judge may have had. However, it is extremely rare that a judge's personal integrity is challenged. It would be deeply worrying if this is part of Mr. Burke's plan, to be executed through his legal team, but it is hardly surprising given the tactics employed by Mr. Burke in his long political career. These kinds of tactics cannot be allowed to succeed and it would be a great scandal if they were allowed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">It is important that the House approves this motion and thereby expresses its confidence and backing for the new chairman and new member of this tribunal and for its future decisions about  costs of past hearings as well as for its continuing hearings. The truth is that the main adversaries and most virulent opponents of the tribunal are not acting in the public interest at all. It suits their interests very well that public confidence in this tribunal and others should wane and be diminished. Their concern is not to save public money but to close down this instrument of public inquiry and exposure. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte that we need to review and enhance our ability in the House to have an inquiring role and to seek all other measures of inquiry and exposure of corruption in public life.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">If we are candid with each other here it is true that the high legal costs of tribunals generally have caused a great deal of public concern, particularly when there are so many needs in many areas of the public services. We must find ways to make tribunals of inquiry more cost-effective and avoid a gravy train for lawyers. The measures proposed this week by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are a very welcome addition to the tools available to the State to establish facts but we will always need the public mechanism provided by the 1921 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">As we know from other countries, the potential for corruption is always there. While we have made progress in creating a political and legal climate that counteracts corruption, one can never rest easy. The human capacity for greed, for self-enrichment and for immorality is a base but common instinct. Against this background, the House today has the opportunity to renew our backing for the tribunal of inquiry into planning matters. It is important we vote and renew that backing. My party and I strongly encourage the House to do so. We look forward to a successful conclusion to its inquiries, including the critical matter of the determination of costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Cleaning up politics has not come cheap but it is a long-term investment in our country's future. As the Tánaiste said last October, following the publication of Mr. Justice Flood's interim report, corrupt societies are not prosperous societies. Our ability to attract job-creating investment requires a clear demonstration that this is a country in which business is done fairly and openly, a country in which the rule of law applies to all, regardless of position, and a country without golden circles, cosy cartels or inside tracks.</p>

          <p eId="para_865">I echo the words of my party leader, Deputy Kenny, in thanking Mr. Justice Feargus Flood for his hard work and impeccable honour over the last six years. His interim report cut through so many contentious issues with clarity and honesty and was a testimony to the courage he showed. It seems like only yesterday that he issued that report. Since then, a lot has changed but not a lot has been done. For example, Ray Burke's prospects seem to have improved from a situation where he was the subject of public dis gust to the possibility of having his €10 million legal bill paid for him. There has been a steady drip-feed of spurious information designed by those in the firing line to rubbish the tribunal and its interim findings. Above all, there is the overwhelming impression that the Government would like to see the entire process collapse in order that the corrupt, greedy and shameless will get away scot-free.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">It is an open secret that Fianna Fáil wants the tribunal to collapse or go on indefinitely in order that most of the issues which need to be investigated will not be for many years.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_872">It has proven that when it comes to transparency and rooting out corruption, the Government is totally and morally bankrupt. While it is clear that some in certain corners do not want to hear what the tribunal has to say, we cannot be distracted by them. My party is of the firm view that necessary legislation should be enacted to enable the tribunal to work as quickly as possible. For justice to be done and be seen to be done, time is of the essence.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">To be fair, some tax bills have been settled because of the work of the tribunal. Politicians and businessmen have been exposed and ostracised in public. The tribunal, even though it has been working slowly, is working and, despite Government spin to the contrary, must be allowed to work. Many of the time delays have been the result of the deliberate tactics used by people and their defence lawyers. Serious questions must be raised about the actions of individuals who have not allowed the tribunal to see the full picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">What is more, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may wish to take note of the comment in the media and this House suggesting that he is attempting to deal with the issue of costs through the legislation he outlined yesterday but which will not be taken until October at the earliest. The whole issue of costs might be  better dealt with through reform of the profession of which he is a member. Let us call a spade a spade. The reason tribunals cost so much is that the legal profession is being paid far too much. Instead of tackling the vested interests, with whom he is no doubt on speaking terms, the Minister has attempted to further denigrate the tribunal process by suggesting it is the nature of tribunals which is at fault. In fact, we heard today that he sanctioned massive fee increases for the lawyers involved with the tribunal. It is not the nature of the tribunals which is at fault but the greed of the vested interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">If the Government was serious about reducing costs for tribunals and litigation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be leading a campaign to reform the law profession. He wants to treat the symptoms instead of the cause. Some Ministers – I am not sure whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Reform is one of them – have proclaimed that tribunals will continue for another 50 years. If it really mattered to them, they would not have waited for more than a year to accede to Mr. Justice Flood's requests, made in good faith, for extra judges. They provided two extra judges and we all anticipated that the tribunal would work at a faster pace but it seems to have gone into reverse. Matters have not progressed as we all anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">It is extraordinary that we are being lectured on costs and delays by a Government which is directly responsible for dither and delay throughout the process. Why is it stalling when it is possible that the Taoiseach may need to go before the tribunal to clear his name, which is surely in his own interest? Is it not unfair to those mentioned in the tribunal that they must wait so long to have their names cleared or have the issues settled once and for all?</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The Flood tribunal was set up to make accountable those in positions who abused their powers. However, this is the least politically accountable Government we have ever had. Its standard operating procedure is to bypass the people's representatives in Dáil Éireann, leak important announcements to the media, get maximum coverage and avoid all but the minimum amount of scrutiny. It sounds like a recipe for another tribunal in the future. One has to ask if we can really believe matters have changed when we are subject to denials that there have been any cutbacks since the general election. How can we trust the Government in anything it does when promise after promise is broken and even its supposed watchdog, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law, downplays his party's promise of 2,000 extra gardaí?</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The Flood tribunal has been a painful process but we must get to the truth which involves political backbone from the Taoiseach and the Government in the future. The Taoiseach has given a guarantee that the allegations levelled  against him by Tom Gilmartin will be heard in public. However, he must also clarify if the tribunal will conduct a public inquiry into Government decisions to grant valuable tax designations for properties in the 1990s. As Minister for Finance in the dying days of the Reynolds Government, he made such a decision in relation to an Athlone site in which a well known Fianna Fáil supporter and financial backer had an interest. We must be told if and when these issues will be dealt with and if they will be dealt with in public or referred to the back room procedures which we are now being told will come about.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">If the Government really cares about justice and transparency, let it ensure a simple, prompt transition between Mr. Justice Flood and Judge Mahon. Above all, let it ensure Ray Burke and his ilk, whose disgraceful behaviour has brought shame to this House, will get the justice which is coming to them. What is needed ultimately is a sea change in its attitude towards accountability. This cannot happen while the Minister for Finance is in Cheltenham and his Minister of State is eroding rights contained in the Freedom of Information Act, nor can it happen while the Taoiseach professes accountability while only gracing us with his presence two days a week on very few weeks of the year. Above all, it cannot happen while an Administration which states it is doing all it can to help the tribunal is at the same time effectively undermining and rubbishing its credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Let us hope a new chairman of the tribunal leads to a new era in rooting out corruption and that by the time we meet again in late September the Government will have opened a new chapter in its own behaviour. I wish to repeat a question put by the Fine Gael leader yesterday. He asked if any member of the Government was compromised in any way by the reforming procedures of the tribunal process or in dealing with any of the other tribunals sitting at present. The leader of Fine Gael has written to the Taoiseach to clarify the situation. We would welcome an early and prompt response.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_458">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_885">I compliment Mr. Justice Flood's good work in identifying those who have poisoned public life. I do not take issue with that. I compliment the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for his comprehensive account of why these resolutions are before the House, the steps that will be taken and the legislation that will be then required, as we all agree, to put the tribunal in a position where the costs issue can be determined. I take it from the indications of support from the other parties in the House that there is universal agreement with the substance of what the Minister has proposed and what is before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">That has not of course avoided a debate in which various points have been made and canvassed, but one crucial point that has to be reiterated is the letter that was sent to the Taoiseach by the chairman of the tribunal on 30 June confirming the position. It stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_887">I refer to my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen on the above matter, in which the reasons underlying my resignation are set out. I note in the public press statements to the effect that inaction by the Government in relation to requests from the tribunal for additional judges or other matters have caused frustration and are the real reason for my resignation.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">These were signed articles in the public press. They were not orchestrated by alleged spin doctors coming from this side of the House, and they did suggest that inaction by the Government in relation to requests for additional judges or other matters caused frustration and led to Mr. Justice Flood's resignation. That is confirmed by the chairman of the tribunal as untrue. His letter went on to state:</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Again, I wish to state categorically that this is not so. My decision is in no way related to or consequent upon any action or inaction of the Government of any kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Thus, the suggestion that any conduct of the Government led to this conclusion is simply untrue. Mr. Justice Flood goes on to state:</p>
          <p eId="para_891">My relationship with the Government is through the Department and the Attorney General. I have at all times during my tenure of office had a relationship with the Attorney General's office that has been exceptionally cordial and co-operative. The allegation that the work of the tribunal has been delayed or frustrated in any way by the Government is completely groundless and has nothing to do with my decision to resign. The reasons for my resignation are solely set out in my correspondence with the Attorney General and Minister Cullen. I trust this letter clarifies the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Thus, the chairman of the tribunal has had an exceptionally cordial and co-operative relation ship with the Attorney General during his tenure of office, which commenced in late 1997. It had been conducted through former Attorneys General, David Byrne and Michael McDowell, and the present Attorney General, Rory Brady.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">"Exceptionally cordial and co-operative" are hardly the words of a chairman of a tribunal whose work is being frustrated by alleged Government spin doctors. They are hardly the basis for a suggestion that this Government has in any way hampered the operations of that tribunal. Quite the contrary. There has been an exceptionally cordial and co-operative relationship between the Flood tribunal and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Deputy Kenny went so far as to suggest that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats cannot claim ownership of this tribunal, and he is quite right. The tribunals are of course creatures of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but we are entitled to point to the fact that we have had this exceptionally good relationship with Mr. Justice Flood, and I thank Mr. Justice Flood for acknowledging that fact and putting it on the record. That was a courageous step. I doubt it will attract the same headlines as some of the suggestions which were canvassed in recent weeks about his resignation. Nevertheless, he has put it on the record and it is important that we reiterate that in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">That is the context in which we have to judge the further set of suggestions and insinuations that were made in this House in the course of this debate by Deputy Kenny and others. It was suggested that in some way, the Taoiseach or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were less than candid or open in the House regarding the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood. The fact is that if there was any delay in this matter or any want of candour on their part, it was entirely prompted by the need to obtain advice from the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">As Mr. Justice Flood points out, his channel of communication with the Government at all stages was the Attorney General. It was only natural, right and proper that the Taoiseach should seek comprehensive legal advice about any correspondence received from Mr. Justice Flood and that before the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government transmitted correspondence to the Clerk of the House, he too should seek that necessary and essential legal advice on a matter of such complexity.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">There are no clouds of confusion in this matter. Mr. Justice Flood has resigned, and we should thank him for the work he has done. He has done signal public service to this State in exposing a degree of wrongdoing, malpractice and unethical behaviour which existed among politicians who were prominent in the public life of this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">While the politicians were prominent in public life, most of the wrongdoing related to the operations of municipal and local government. One of the cautionary aspects of the Flood report is the danger of vesting too many powers in local government. We often hear calls from various sides in this House to give local government more power, but a careful perusal of the Flood report would suggest the contrary conclusion that we are better off in a small jurisdiction such as this—</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_900">That happens to be my personal position. I am not speaking for the Government in this issue. If we trace the history of local government back to the 1898 Act, this has not been the first episode of this character in local government. It has been the largest and most outrageous but not the first.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">I wish Mr. Justice Flood a happy retirement. He has worked hard and undertaken his duties in a conscientious manner. I wish him well in his retirement. I also wish Judge Mahon well, and I agree with Deputy Rabbitte on one point. I shared his misapprehension that when three judges were assigned to the work of this tribunal of inquiry, it might be possible for them to sit separately and determine issues in a separate way. Were that done, I have no doubt that it would expedite the work of the tribunal. Again, as was made clear in the course of this debate, that is a matter for the tribunal itself to determine. I welcome Deputy Rabbitte's stating of the fact in the House that he would like to see that happen. If it does assist in expediting the work of the tribunal in dealing with more of these modules, then all the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">So much for the politics of this matter. There is no grand plan to reconfigure the Flood tribunal to party advantage but there is on this side of the House, as I am sure there are on all sides, an anxiety to see how this operation can become cheaper, more economical and speedier in determining the issues involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">One of the reflections I would like to make on it relates to the question of private investigation and the commission on investigations legislation which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has tabled before the House. This is important legislation, and there is no suggestion that it is an attempt to exclude matters from the public domain. The first tribunal in the recent past which achieved great success and received many compliments was the tribunal led by Mr. Justice McCracken on certain payments connected with Mr. Dunne and the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey. If one looks at that particular report, one of the interesting features of it is that it is brief and that the work of the tribunal was done very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">One of the reasons that happened was because there was an extensive private investigation conducted on a separate basis by Judge Buchanan before the tribunal of inquiry itself proceeded. That is a salutary lesson that we should look at regarding the operations of these bodies. A lot of the sifting work should be done on a preliminary and private basis. That is not to exclude from the public domain the necessary investigation that has to take place in public where serious issues arise. However, at least if that private phase exists in a structured way prior to the tribunal coming into existence, that should expedite the operations and minimise the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">As regards Oireachtas investigations, there is no doubt that the decision of the Supreme Court in the Abbeylara case has put a considerable restriction on the operation of this type of inquiry. It is desirable that Oireachtas committees should be able to investigate the Administration itself to the utmost degree, but I have a concern about Oireachtas committees adjudicating on matters where questions of good name, reputation or misconduct arise. The reason for the 1920 Act in the first place was because the parliamentary machinery that operated in the House of Commons was inadequate to investigate political scandals. It was the Marconi scandal and the farcical investigation that led to the 1920 Act. I am not convinced that partisan politicians can make judicial determinations about themselves. I remain to be convinced of that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_906">I wish to join colleagues in supporting the motion to appoint Judge Mahon to be chairperson of the planning tribunal and to appoint Judge Gerald Keys as the third member of the tribunal. I join colleagues also in paying tribute to the work of Mr. Justice Flood and to wish him well in his retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">This tribunal was established by the Dáil and Seanad Éireann in October 1997. Back then few expected that it would report in as forthright a manner as was demonstrated in its second interim report. Nobody anticipated either that six years later the tribunal would have completed an investigation on only two issues, that the legal costs associated with these issues would still not be determined, that conceivably the taxpayer could be exposed to the full bill and that the tribunal would have only commenced public investigation into the wider issue of corruption in the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">This is not to criticise the tribunal or its members – far from it. This tribunal has done this State a great service. In its interim report it made it clear that no office holder elected or appointed is immune from accountability and that sooner or later any holder of public office in this State, no matter how arrogantly he or she exercised his or her power at the time, will be called to account for his or her decisions and  especially for any decisions which were influenced by bribery or corruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">This tribunal has lifted the lid on corruption in the planning process. It has helped to create a new and welcome climate in public life, in which there is no place for corrupt practices of any kind. This tribunal was established by the Dáil and Seanad. We have a continuing responsibility to ensure that its work is completed, that investigations are fully conducted and that certain matters are not buried or brushed aside. We also have a responsibility to ensure that the tribunal process is not unnecessarily lengthy or costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The first issue which faces the Dáil and Seanad at this point is to ensure that the good work of the tribunal is continued and completed – in that context, it is appropriate that this motion be passed – and the second issue is how that objective can be reconciled with the needs to minimise time and costs. The prolonged nature of this tribunal may yet frustrate its own objectives. It is fortunate that in the six years to date of the tribunal, none of the key witnesses has died or become incapacitated and was, therefore, unable to give evidence – even if reluctantly. We need to reflect on the consequences for the tribunal's inquiry of the possibility of key witnesses being unavailable to give evidence. What kind of report could the tribunal make on a particular module on which a person, who had made an important statement to the tribunal, had died or become incapacitated before he or she had the opportunity to give evidence and to be cross-examined? With every passing year, the risk increases that key witnesses will pass away and that the investigation of important matters will be frustrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The length of the tribunal is related to its cost. It is very difficult for an elderly, infirm pensioner, who has been refused a disabled person's grant for a downstairs walk-in shower or a bedroom conversion, to understand why a barrister at the tribunal is paid more from public funds in a week than would pay for the essential home conversion in the first place. It may be time, given the semi-permanent nature of this tribunal to consider the employment of its legal professionals on a full-time salaried basis – for which there is plenty of precedents in the Attorney General's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions office and other State legal offices – rather than on a fee basis as at present. That would only reduce the costs of the tribunal's operation; it would not necessarily reduce the costs applying to witnesses. The staggering figures which have been claimed by legal teams representing witnesses to this tribunal cry out for radical reform of legal costs and access to the law here. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the Government intends to address at all the restrictive practices of and excessive charging by the well-heeled legal professions, much less with the enthusiasm they demonstrated in taking on working class people who drive taxis.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">That being so, large claims for legal fees will continue to pour in as public hearings of the tribunals continue. It seems the costs of tribunals are related to the issue of public hearings, and I wonder if it is not possible to conduct more of the investigations, as is provided for in the terms of reference and legislation of this tribunal, by the use of investigators, interviews and examination of documents and to confine the public stage of inquiries to the consideration of the facts which are established by these investigations and to the hearing of serious and substantial conflicts of evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">The public hearings necessarily involve the presence of legal teams for each of the parties – those giving evidence of wrongdoing because they have to be cross-examined, those against whom the allegations are made and the tribunal itself. It is difficult to see how this can be limited or how the judges of the tribunal can confine matters like a judge can in a normal trial. The issue, therefore, which I think has to be addressed in the longer term is how to strike the balance between the investigation which may be conducted in private and those hearings which are held in public. The striking of this balance must enjoy public confidence, otherwise the whole purpose of the tribunals is defeated. The public want allegations of serious wrongdoing to be fully investigated and those responsible to be held to account. When it comes to corruption nobody should be allowed to get away with it. At the same time the public whom we represent want it done expeditiously and efficiently and they want a limit on the amounts of their tax euros which are spent on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">Unfortunately, the way in which the Government has handled this issue over the course of the past week does not lend itself to an increase in public confidence in its approach to this tribunal. First of all we were told nothing about the correspondence of 28 May or nothing of the meeting which took place with the Attorney General on 26 May. We were led to believe a letter arrived from Mr. Justice Flood on 16 June, that the Attorney General was away and could not deal with it and that it was only when it came to Government on 24 May that the Taoiseach and perhaps other members of the Government could address it. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government tells us today that the letter of 16 June was transferred to him by the Attorney General on 18 June for circulation to the Clerks of the Houses. Instead of circulating it to the Clerks of the Houses, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government submitted it to the Government. I invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, when replying to this debate, to explain to the House why the letter, which was transferred to him on 18 June for circu lation to the Clerks of the Houses, was not circulated to the Clerks of the Houses until 24 June and, second, given what the Government knew about Mr. Justice Flood's intention, why did I get the kind of reply I got to a parliamentary question on 17 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The Minister will recall that there was press speculation around the June bank holiday weekend that the Government was planning some changes in relation to the Flood tribunal. In response to that speculation I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for reply on 17 June. I asked the Minister if he was considering – I emphasise the word "considering"– seeking the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas for a change of the mandate, terms of reference or methods of tribunal of inquiry and if he would make a statement on the matter to which I got a one line reply, that there are no such proposals. That is an astonishing reply from a Minister who had a letter from Mr. Justice Flood indicating that he was going to retire and who knew for two or three weeks that was the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">I also invite the Minister to respond to the issue of costs. It is not the case that the Minister in his letter of reply to Mr. Justice Flood of 24 June asked Mr. Justice Flood to address the issue of costs. I will refer to the particular paragraph. It reads:</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The Government would consider it preferable if you were in a position to decide the question of costs. However, in the light of the contents of your letter it is clear that you are of the view that such is not the position. Legislation will be required to deal with this issue so as to reduce as best we can the risk of legal challenges arising from the proposal that the costs issue should be dealt with by a new chairperson.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">The only interpretation that Mr. Justice Flood or anybody could make of that response is that the Government accepted, with regret, that he was not going to deal with the issue of costs. It most certainly was not a request by the Government to Mr. Justice Flood to deal with the issue of costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_919">Like other Deputies in the House, I congratulate Mr. Justice Flood on his service, not only in the Flood tribunal over the past six years, but in the decade and a half of service which he has given as a judge of the High Court, and as chairman of the Commission on Disability. Like others here too, I wish him well in his retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Our focus today is not so much on the tribunal but on the change in its chairmanship and on where the tribunal might now go. It is an oppor tune time for us to reflect on the benefit and value of the work done by this tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">I suspect that when we set the tribunal up in October 1997, when we asked it to report by Christmas of that year, none of us anticipated that six years later, we would not have got to the end of the matter.</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_923">It was set up to deal with specific planning matters, and we amended the terms of reference thereafter to investigate other matters. It is right that due regard and cognisance should be given to the fact that serious malpractice and corruption was identified and discovered, and was made public in Mr. Justice Flood's interim report – malpractice and corruption going on in certain areas by a limited number of people, let it be said, throughout the country. The report has highlighted a low standard to which none of us in this House would want to stoop. It is on foot of the publication of that report that much of the legislation about standards and ethics for people in public life has been published. As late as today we published a code of conduct for office-holders, which sets out even more stringent guidelines than are contained in the statutory regulations already introduced in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The work of the tribunal, albeit long and costly, has been very valuable, yet the developments of last week have caused us to look at two different things. One is the immediate one, the resolution before us with regard to the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood and proposing Judge Mahon as chairperson of the tribunal and Judge Keys as a full member of the tribunal. We wish them both well in their work. It is important that there should be a smooth and orderly continuation of the work of the tribunal in whatever way it sees fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">It is also important to point out that that the work currently in hand and the issues currently being investigated, will continue to be investigated, in public, until they are completed. The technical name the tribunal gives to this is "module A5". That includes all the matters currently being looked at by the tribunal. The tribunal has indicated that it will take it until the end of December 2006 to complete it. So be it. It is important that where allegations have been made, they should be properly investigated – in public – up until that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">I understand however that there are some 15 other modules which the tribunal wants to investigate. Obviously, when the Oireachtas extended the tribunal's terms of reference, more issues were raised by members of the public, more questions were asked and more allegations were made about various issues throughout the country. There is an opportunity for us to see how those modules, or allegations, or questions can be dealt  with. Can they be dealt with more efficiently, more expeditiously and more cost-effectively? The legislation introduced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, can go some of the way towards ensuring that. Deputy Rabbitte suggested that that would deal with the private and investigative role – but that it itself can be very cost-effective because at the moment we are paying senior counsel top fees to do what is basically the work of investigative journalists. There is no need for that element to be looked after by senior counsel. There will be an opportunity when we come back in the autumn, when we are looking at legislation, to see how we might assist the tribunal and how it might look at its own work methods in order to see how its ongoing work might be continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Arising out of last week's events, the outstanding issue was that of costs. That will need legislation in the autumn. It must be the determination of the Houses of the Oireachtas to ensure that the public interest and money is protected, that justice is done and seen to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Deputy Rabbitte spoke earlier about people who would have delayed the tribunal, who would have been time-wasters, and asked if they could be penalised. The legislation allows for that, because under the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts, the legislation allows for a person being granted or not being granted costs, and direction can be given that tribunal costs – or another person's costs – must be made by a party who has appeared before the tribunal. The facility is there for the tribunal to do that. The basis on which that can happen is not set out, but the tribunal members can decide to do it. We have to deal with this issue in the autumn, and introduce legislation which is administratively enabling. The former tribunal chairman held power related to costs, and we must enable the incoming chairman to exercise that power too.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">There are issues to be raised, and as the Government said, and the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, said in his letter, it would have been preferable if the question of costs had been dealt with. It would have been more clear-cut. With the joint knowledge of all members of the Oireachtas, I believe we will be able to come up with legislation to deal with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Another issue which has arisen in the debate today is that surrounding the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood. It has been asked why the letter of 28 May was not made public. If people read all the documentation relating to that time, it will be clear that the letter was not made public because Mr. Justice Flood specifically wrote and asked that it would not be made public.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">As I stated within recent days, the Attorney General brought notice of the letter to Government at the first opportunity where it could be discussed. It was arising out of that meeting and the quick discussion there that the Taoiseach said in this House that he had not had an opportunity to study all of the legalities. As we now know, there are a number of legalities attached to this issue, and they have to be addressed by us in two different ways – the resolution this week and the legislation coming up in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Many issues arise from all of this. Where will the tribunal go in the future? How can it do its work more efficiently? That we have three judges now sitting has been referred to. Perhaps when this first module is out of the way, one can look to see if the judges can sit in parallel and perhaps speed up the work. I hope there will be a role for Members of the Oireachtas and for parliamentary inquiries, but we are aware of how we have fallen foul in this area in the past. It remains something we can look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">Irrespective of what happens, and who said what to whom in recent weeks, we are now faced with the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood. We are trying to move forward on an interim report in anticipation of a final report on the tribunal. It is the aim of every Member of this House that the highest standards should be employed by everybody in public office – and by people working in  public administration. Very often, the focus at this tribunal has been on politicians, be they local or national. A similar focus is necessary on a certain number – again a small group – of officials who were involved and named. That type of practice needs to be rooted out as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">This week in the House we had a motion relating to the Civil Service code of standards and behaviour to match the one we introduced for ourselves as Members and officeholders. The high standards of ethics which Members of this House reach often go unnoticed. Today, at the handing over of the code of conduct for officeholders to the judge responsible for the Standards in Public Office Commission, the judge wanted to draw attention to the fact that every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas had complied with his or her tax affairs. However, not one media person covered this. Regardless of what happened in the past, including those matters being investigated by the tribunals, they are not the standards to which Members of this House now adhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_948">I wish to share my time equally with Deputies Twomey and Boyle.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">The constituency I represent, Dublin South-West, more specifically Tallaght, is synonymous with bad planning. Not too long ago we had large housing estates with badly built housing, no shops, poor roads, no community facilities and a bus service that was irregular and totally unreliable. Tens of thousands of people were located there with no access to jobs or the potential of employment. To this day people are still paying the price, socially and economically, of these decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">While we all congratulate Mr. Justice Flood and his staff for the excellent work they have done so far, there are obvious flaws in the tribunal system. It is clear that the public is growing increasingly cynical about tribunals. They are concerned at the fact that despite years of work and millions of euro, no one appears to have been brought to justice for the corruption and bribery that resulted in some of the most bizarre planning decisions in history of the State. No one has spent a single day in prison as a result of the tribunals' findings. A former Deputy was imprisoned for failing to co-operate sufficiently with a tribunal but significantly not for any of his alleged activities during the years. This process is full of contradictions. We have seen a tribunal set up to  inquire into an elite golden circle of speculators and developers in society, creating a new golden circle centred around the Law Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The crooks and wrongdoers are still at large and the taxpayer continues to foot the bill. The total estimated cost of the tribunal to date in terms of legal costs claimed by third parties is a staggering €21.5 million, not inclusive of VAT. There are some reports indicating it might go on until 2015. It states public hearings will go on until at least 2006. I cannot help but think how things would have been different if this was not white-collar crime. What is happening – more importantly, what is not happening – speaks volumes about Irish society, the legal system and politics in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">While the tribunal deliberates, many throughout the State have to live with the consequences of corrupt planning decisions with poor infrastructure, bad roads, no community and sport facilities, inferior housing and a housing market increasingly out of the range of most couples and families. That is the real scandal behind the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments and ordinary taxpayers are once again being asked to foot the bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_480">
          <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
          <p eId="para_953">Like everyone else in the House, I thank Mr. Justice Flood for attempting to lift the veil of secrecy surrounding corruption in Irish political life for some time. As long as Government agencies award contracts worth millions of euro and as long as local authorities have the power to make hundreds of thousands of euro for their own members and close associates by means of dubious planning decisions, we will continue to see corruption in Irish political life. Corruption and politics are almost synonymous because of the power invested in politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Apart from the tribunals, what else is being done? Transparency, accountability and a desire to at least try to control this self-interest and corruption by a few rotten apples should be the hallmark of any government, national or local. We all know it is still going on, as do senior members of political parties. Recent changes to the Freedom of Information Act do not inspire confidence in those in the media who will try to discover the elements of corruption that still remain. We seem to be putting the problem to one side in many respects.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The debacle about Mr. Justice Flood has taken the shine off many of the initial feelings we had that the tribunals would make a difference; it now seems nothing will change. As mentioned, the golden circle of developers and politicians continues to operate as usual. They fear nothing from any tribunal because they believe there is no political will to stop them, even if they were exposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">The law profession continues to be the major beneficiary of all tribunals. It is odd that fees that exceed €1 million do little to cause excitement in  Government circles. Last week on the publication of the Brennan report everybody was jumping up and down at the thought of hospital consultants earning €140,000 per year. Such figures would be considered paltry and laughable in the Law Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The only outcome of the tribunal may be to legitimise corruption in the planning system because justice is not seen to be done and people believe they can evade justice in the long-term. The protracted legal arguments we have seen at all the tribunals would not be tolerated if less privileged members of society were at the centre of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">On a broader level, this lack of transparency and inaction by the Government on many serious issues was tolerated by voters in the past when everything was going well. However, now that things are going badly, not only for the Government but also for the people as a whole, we are getting more angry with what is happening. We do not realise we are being hoodwinked, albeit in a much more sophisticated manner by the golden circle of politicians and developers who spawned this era of tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I hope all this discussion about Mr. Justice Flood and the long-term implications of tribunals will change the focus and that we will really try to root out corruption from Irish political life. I am not talking about small issues but big ones that are making hundreds of thousands of euro for individuals.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_960">We wish Mr. Justice Flood well in his retirement and thank him for the work he has done on our behalf. His replacement as chairperson of the tribunal by Judge Mahon and as a member of the tribunal by Judge Keys will not result in a division in this House. While there is unanimity in proceeding with the work of the tribunal, there is disagreement as to how effectively the tribunal has been allowed to do that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">The Government has cited in various contributions the political etiquette that has accompanied the letters surrounding the resignation. However, it is known that disquiet and frustration have been expressed by members of the tribunal team regarding not getting the resources when they were required and not being allowed to do as much work as they intended to do by a certain timeframe. As we are now moving into a new timeframe, I hope we can help the tribunal expedite its work and answer the many unanswered questions on this subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">In stressing the limited nature of the motion the amendment by the Labour Party that was ruled out of order was paralleled by an amendment the Green Party sought to table which asked that all the information already been judged by preliminary investigation continue to be heard by a full public inquiry. Even though the Taoiseach has given a commitment on certain  modules, particularly the Gilmartin module, there are others that may be heard in private session from which the public may not get an opportunity to get the full facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">As we have believed since the first debate in 1997, proceedings of the tribunal should be recorded and broadcast. Laudable as the recreations by Joe Taylor and Malcolm Douglas have been, members of the public should have the opportunity to see the physical reaction and discomfort of those lying about their activities. This has been a significant factor in tribunals in other jurisdictions. It is something that we should be encouraging the tribunal to do if it is in our power. Through the mechanism of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, the Attorney General can approach the tribunal and ask whether it is prepared to approach the Oireachtas for certain changes to be made. That is an avenue we can go down.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">The culture that underwrites the potential for corruption in political life unfortunately still exists. It is because bad decisions are made on foot of bad and even corrupt decisions made in the past. The decision made today by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government insisting that the road goes through Carrickmines Castle is typical of that type of bad decision making. This is a site that has been questionably, and possibly illegally and corruptly, zoned. On the last day of this Dáil session, we are looking at a decision made on behalf of the Government on the back of a local authority decision that cannot have been made safely.</p>

          <p eId="para_969">I thank all Members who have spoken on this important debate. I am also grateful for the support for the resolution that is apparent in the House. It is important that we make clear that none of the terms of reference to the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments is being changed. It is important that this is stated, as there is some impression among Members that this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">We are here on foot of this resolution to appoint Judge Alan Mahon as chairperson of the tribunal and Judge Gerald Keys as a member of the tribunal at their request. The purpose of  doing this is to ensure that the tribunal can get back to public hearings immediately. We should be clear in our minds that it is only last Friday that Mr. Justice Flood brought absolute clarity to his position. In six days, the Government, as the Members of the Oireachtas would have wished, came to the House with this resolution to ensure that the tribunal can continue with its hearings and get them into the public domain. We all subscribe to that and this was the basis of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">I wish to read into the Official Report, the response to question (b) of my letter to the tribunal. I asked about the likely duration, up to completion, of all matters arising within the terms of reference (as amended) of the tribunal. The answer stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_972">As set out above, the Tribunal anticipates that public hearings relating to the current modules will be completed by the end of 2006. The duration of the Tribunal beyond 2006 will depend upon the number of issues, if any, which are deemed to merit public inquiry. The Tribunal is currently investigating a number of issues in private but no decision has been taken as to whether any of these issues require public hearing. It is anticipated that within the next twelve months the Tribunal will be in a position to decide whether any of the issues should be heard in public and, at that time, the Tribunal will be in a position to advise you, and the Oireachtas, of the likely duration of the public hearings relating to any such issue.</p>

It is without question the wish  of the Government that these matters are dealt with in a full, open, accountable transparent way. That has been the approach of this Government in working with the Oireachtas. The Government accepts that it is the primacy of the Oireachtas that set up these tribunals and I respect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">With regard to issue of the letters raised by Deputy Gilmore, the letter sent to me dated 18 June was the letter of 16 June. Some have asked why I did not immediately come to the Oireachtas when it was sent to me. I did not receive the letter on 18 June, I received it late on 19 June. I believed the letter was of importance and significance to both the tribunal and the Houses of the Oireachtas. The proper and most prudent course of action was to bring it to the Government at the first opportunity. That was at the Government meeting of 24 June. The only intervening period in that timeframe was the weekend. I believe I would have done a disservice to the tribunal and the Oireachtas if I had acted in a different way. I believe it was the correct and most prudent way to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">I was present at that meeting when the matter was discussed. It was only at that point that all of the legal issues and the many questions were asked with regard to the legal difficulties that could or may arise on foot of this letter. That was the first lengthy discussion in which the Taoiseach and members of the Government were involved directly. On conclusion of that meeting, the Taoiseach immediately came to Dáil Éireann to inform Members with regard to the contents of the letter. I, in parallel with this, forwarded those letters to the Clerks of the Dáil and the Seanad. The leaders of Fine Gael and the Labour Party responded, acknowledging there were legal complexities in those issues that have to be teased out. That brings clarity to that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">A number of Members asked why we did not have the legislation dealing with the costs before the House this week. As Members know it raises a number of questions. The matter requires reflection, as was agreed by Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte, in my understanding. The few months that are now available will be used to reflect upon that and to frame that legislation. The legislation must ensure the fullest means by which the tribunal can continue and Judge Mahon can hear those cost hearings without any impediments. We all wish for that. To have rushed that legislation in the last few days would have been the wrong approach. We were right to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">I want to emphasise again that it was only last Friday that the final certainty was brought to this matter by Mr. Justice Flood. Within six days of that, we came before the House with a resolution that confirms the new chairman and member of the tribunal. The purpose of that is to ensure that the tribunal can go into public hearings immediately. I agree with Deputy Rabbitte, as does the Taoiseach, that it is a matter for the judges to  hear many issues in parallel. This could expedite some of the matters. We will support that but it is a matter for the tribunal.</p>

As I said, I will then sit down with the  farming organisations and the social partners and other interested parties. If it is not available by the end of this month as August is a holiday month in the Commission, it would then slip over into September. We really do not want that to happen. We want to get it as soon as possible. There are many issues such as entitlements and hereditary rights, people with land leased and those in pension situations which need to be sorted out. Some type of model or facility may need to be devised to allow young people to gain access to quota rights. We have to put a reserve aside for them and we have yet to decide on the size of this. There are still outstanding technical matters.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_502" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_997">The agreement reached on 26 June 2003 by the Council of Ministers on the mid-term review of the CAP represented a successful outcome for Ireland. My prime objectives were to safeguard the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement and ensure the best possible level of support and protection of our production base into the future. These objectives have been met and the potential negative aspects of the Commission's original proposals have been either eliminated or minimised.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">There will be no loss of income to Irish farmers arising from the changes agreed to the market regimes if sales to intervention are replaced by sales to higher-priced markets. If farm-gate prices fall in line with the reduction in the intervention price in the milk sector, the loss would be €14 million or about 1% of the farm-gate value of milk output. In the cereals sector, the effect on  farm incomes of the 50% reduction in the monthly increments is estimated as negligible. In so far as decoupling is concerned, the effect on farm incomes will depend on which of the decoupling options is implemented. In this regard, I will shortly commence a process of consultations before deciding on which option to implement. There will be a loss of €6 million a year, or less than 0.5% of direct payments from the modulation arrangements. The Commission's digression proposals, which would have involved an annual loss of €56 million a year, have been dropped.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The agreement reached by the Council of Ministers, and, in particular, the decoupling arrangements, will considerably strengthen the EU's negotiating position in the forthcoming WTO negotiations in Cancun in September and will enhance the security of direct payments to Irish farmers. It will also strengthen the sustainability of the Common Agricultural Policy into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1000">When the Minister says there should be no loss to the farming community arising from the reform, does he plan to put in place support systems such as marketing supports? There will clearly be a need to divert the marketing of products generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">My second question relates to consultation with the farming organisations. Does the Minister plan to have consultations with all the farming organisations, whether or not they are in the partnership agreement? The Minister's Department issued a press release yesterday announcing public consultation. I welcome this as it is a good idea. While I do not know if it is by accident or otherwise – I am sure it is an accident – the food processors are absent from it. The rural community and consumers are mentioned but not processors. Perhaps the Minister will comment on this.</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_1002">Direct farm supports amount to €1.3 billion per annum and these have been safeguarded in the context of the WTO talks. A consensus is emerging that there will be decoupling in Ireland. I will wait for the outcome before we decide on the ultimate model. Breaking the link with production will mean that those payments go into the green box in the context of the WTO and are thereby secured for the future. We make payments of about €1.6 billion per year and the rest is made up of REPS payments and the farm retirement scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">Regarding the dairy industry and the reduction of an additional 4% in intervention support, this is compensated for by a dairy cow premium that makes up about 80% of the loss. I have asked the dairy industry to go closer to the market place and produce for the ultimate consumer. Last year, I set up the Prospectus study. This study  clearly shows what needs to be done by the dairy industry. Grant aid, particularly research and development grants, is available from Enterprise Ireland to allow the industry get its house in order. There will be a five year lead in period in that butter in intervention starts off at 70,000 tonnes next year declining to 30,000 tonnes over five years. I hope and expect that the dairy industry will take on board the recommendations of the Prospectus report and avail of Enterprise Ireland research and development grants to tackle opportunities in the market place into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1008">The agreement reached on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy affords member states the flexibility to choose from a number of decoupling options those that best suit the individual countries' production systems. I will seek the views of the social partners and the other interests before deciding on the best available options for Ireland. I cannot, at this stage, make any substantive comments on the issues involved until these discussions have taken place. Similarly, I cannot speculate how the reforms will be implemented across all member states. In general terms, however, new opportunities should exist for producers, including organic producers, to respond to the market demand for quality food. Apart from decoupling, certain other elements of the package may be beneficial to the development of organic farming in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">Will the Minister agree that the philosophy behind the Fischler proposals and their agreement at the Council of Ministers offers a huge potential for the organic sector? It is a potential that would be helped by clarity from the Minister and his Department as to what can be done and when it can be done. Will the Minister  consider the example of Germany in producing set targets for the proportion of agricultural produce produced through an organic sector by a set year? I would encourage him in his discussions with the social partners to put such proposals on the table to see whether agreement is forthcoming and whether it can be worked towards collectively?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_509">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_1010">I agree with Deputy Boyle that there is an opportunity for organic produce and of that there is little doubt. More and more consumers want to have food that is naturally produced, free of residues and devoid of any deleterious material. To that end, a greater effort should be made by our farmers to fill that niche in the market. For example, there are many parts of the country that would have a famine were it not for the amount of vegetable products delivered there once a week. Not alone are they delivered once a week from city areas but they have already been imported into the country. With decoupling, or breaking the link with production, the FAPRI economic study suggested that there would be a 16% reduction in the suckler cow herd and a 5% reduction in the ewe flock. There will certainly be opportunities in terms of land use. We have a very sizeable import bill for food at €3 billion per annum. I am not suggesting that all that market can be availed of by Irish producers and farmers but there is a substantial niche in the market and that is only in the home market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Farmhouse cheese manufacturers at cottage food level have shown that not alone have they made inroads into the Irish market but they have done very well in the British and French markets. There are opportunities. To fall back and say: " There is no market, we would prefer to make the old type products", is just not good enough any more. People will be given their single farm grant and after that they will have to go for their opportunities in the market place. Good, young Irish farmers will go for that opportunity and they will surprise themselves and everybody else in how well they will do.</p>

In addressing the farming pillar in social partnership, will he ensure that such consultation involves as wide a consultation as possible within the farming community with as many representatives of the organic sector as possible?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_511">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_1013">The representatives will be involved in the consultation. The German target is very ambitious at 20% but it may be no harm to be ambitious. It would be more realistic to have a target of 10%. Most success stories have set a target and aim for an objective. That  can be done in Ireland. We have most of the elements in place with thankfully, a system that is almost organic. With a little more effort we could go all the way and meet the EU criteria for organic production. I will meet representatives of the organic industry and listen carefully to what they have to say. I am convinced there are opportunities there.</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_1015">In the mid-term review agreement reached last week there is a reduction in intervention support prices for milk and a reduction in the monthly increments in the case of cereals. Producer incomes will fall only if the market prices fall in line with the reductions in support prices. The effect on cereals producers is estimated to be negligible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">As far as the dairy sector is concerned it is useful to outline the specifics of the agreement in relation to this sector. First, the quota regime was extended to 2015, thus providing producers and processors alike with a stable environment within which to plan for the future. In the absence of agreement on MTR, the quota system was due to end automatically in 2008. The reduction in intervention price support amounted to about 4% over and above what had already been agreed under Agenda 2000 in 1999. That the additional reduction is compensated for at the rate of 80% means its actual impact is very limited. The extent to which milk prices will reflect the support price reduction is dependent on a number of factors, in particular the level of prices on the market, the type and range of products produced and the extent to which milk processors and the industry generally rely on intervention as an outlet. It should be recalled that the Commission's proposal would have resulted in a cut of 10% over and above Agenda 2000 with compensation only at the rate of 56%.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">It is generally acknowledged by everybody that there will be much more pressure on dairy farmers. I agree with the Minister that every other sector is reasonably happy. The problem is in the dairy sector. Is there any specific action the Minister can take to help the smaller dairy producer? We all know they are the backbone of agriculture and of rural communities. The younger dairy farmers and those farmers with the lower amount of quotas need to be protected and helped.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_514">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_1018">In anticipation of the upcoming agreement and the WTO round of talks I met the dairy industry chief executives and pointed out to them that we could no longer rely on intervention to the extent that we had relied on it. We have 70,000 tonnes of butter in intervention and a similar amount of skim milk powder out of a total of 200,000 tonnes. The Commission is afraid of mountains of butter and powder again. It knows very well that it makes no sense whatsoever to proceed in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">The Prospectus study was embarked on and I have since met the chief executives of the co-ops, PLCs and talked to them about sharing facilities. There was a meeting with Dairygold early this week and the chief executives said they had four plants in their co-op making the same product. The costs and the overheads involved means they cannot continue like that in the future. We have six main plants in Ireland and we have approximately the same amount of milk as Denmark, yet it has only one for the entire country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">When I made the case, as Deputy Hayes made it, to try to help the industry in the best way I could at the Council of Ministers by looking for 100,000 tonnes of butter per annum, it was aghast. I remember the Danish Minister asking me afterwards if I was serious. The Minister from the Netherlands told me there was not any future in shovelling butter into intervention. It would cause mayhem because it must come out of storage sooner or later. The taxpayers pay for it in storage and when it comes out, it depresses prices in the marketplace or, alternatively, it is dumped on third countries, which are the least developed in the world. They are trying to eke out a living and to develop their industry. There was an agreement on 70,000 tonnes depreciating to 30,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">I met Dan Flinter of Enterprise Ireland, who will retire soon, and some other senior people there to show my support for the industry in new processes and products because that is the only way to go. The leaders of our dairy industry are being less than fair to farmer producers who have improved their position. Anyone going into a dairy farm now compared to 25 years ago will see fabulous milking parlours and good breeds of cattle. There is better protein and solids in milk than there was before, although we have some way to go yet. However, the amount of improvement and development on the farms is not reflected in the processing sector. There are plenty of opportunities in that area, particularly when one considers that there are 400 million consumers in Europe, which will increase to 509 million from 1 April next year. I am glad that Dairygold, which has appointed a young manager, is embarking on that route.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">I launched a commemorative stamp recently for a Cork man, Henry Ford, who came from my parish in Ballinascarty – I did not see Deputy Boyle there. He made the old model T car. He  had to develop the range of his products because if he had continued with the model T, Ford would be out of business now. He could not say he would store the model T for years and expect the taxpayer to pay for it. Society changes and modernises. Our dairy industry must do the same.</p>

          <p eId="para_1024">I made a statement in the Seanad yesterday and I listened to the various contributions. One interesting contribution was made by Senator Quinn, who owns a number of supermarkets. He said it grieved him to walk past the shelves of dairy products, particularly cheese, and to see that approximately 75% of them are imported from Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand. I gave the example of west Cork where there is a long tradition of distillation, some of which is legal and some of which is illegal. We convert the lactose from milk, which is a natural product, into alcohol and it is sold here and around the world as Boru vodka. It is called after Brian Boru. That is the type of process and product development I am talking about. Bailey's Cream Liqueur is another example. No one said a cream liqueur was required. However, the dairy industry had a problem because lactose from cheese making was going into the streams and rivers creating pollution, particularly at weekends. It had to do something about that, so it converted the lactose into alcohol, added the cream, got a stabiliser and made a cream liqueur. It is now a world brand leader. That is the type of imagination which is required. A range of products could be incorporated into bakery, general food and pharmaceutical industries. The dairy industry must apply its mind and ingenuity for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1028">I see him now. I am sure the reply I have been given was compiled with great skill by senior officials in the Department. The outcome of the mid-term review was satisfactory. It  will reshape agriculture into the future. It will also ensure that farming is supported, but not product. Farmers will get a single farm payment each year based on the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, which are the reference years. That payment will be a cushion. They will then embark on the farming of livestock or cereals for which there is a market. They will get their return solely from the marketplace. That is what the agreement is about.</p>

          <p eId="para_1031">There are many views on CAP reform. However, I want to know the Minister's view on the contention that full decoupling will lead to a drop in the volume and quality of cattle and sheep being produced which, in turn, will lead to job losses in the processing industry and a substantial loss in export earnings to the economy. I want to return to a question Deputy Upton asked, but I will be more specific. I invite the Minister to confirm that the Irish Cattle Traders and Stockowners Association will not be excluded from the consultation and negotiation process which will take place and that it will be a full member of the forum which will engage in the negotiations on the implementation of the CAP reform deal. I am sure the Minister is aware that it is the only farming organisation which believes that full decoupling is the way forward. I cannot see how negotiations can be held and a successful outcome achieved if this organisation, which holds that view, is not included. The Minister was quoted as saying he would consult the social partners. However, as Deputy Upton said, it is not a member of the partnership process. If the Minister engages solely with the social partners, it will be excluded. Can the Minister confirm that it will be a full member of the consultation process?</p>

          <p eId="para_1034">It was first out of the traps. If one gets to the first bend, it is half the battle. I will consult with that organisation. I am anxious, though, to have a formula or model in place which will protect our production base. I do not want to see briars and buachallán buí growing all  over the country. It is not so easy to switch farming on and off. I am considering the possibility of introducing a premium to be given at the end of the production cycle so that there will be a bonus for people who finish. If people in the beef industry, for example, become involved with very high quality beef such as Angus, Belgian Blue or Charolais for a specific market that niche is there for them. There is no point in trying to put meat on the low quality Holstein from the dairy herd. That will not work for the future. I undertake to enter consultation with the farming organisations as well as organisations such as ICOS and the smaller producers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1036">That is a good point. Whether the negotiations took place early in the morning or late at night, towards the concluding hours of the negotiations, there are always teething problems with the systems that result. The economists and everybody else say this thing or that will happen. Funnily enough, things do not work out that way. The way people respond to new situations is always different to what is predicted. There is a built-in review in two years to consider the structure of the industry – if people have abandoned sheep production totally, for example, this must be investigated. We will also need to find out how the marketplace is being affected by breaking the link with production. It will be clear in the final text that this is built in.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1038">The Government decided on 19 March 2003 that Bord Glas should be amalgamated with Bord Bia and the general scheme of a Bill to effect this decision has now been approved by Government. In preparing this general scheme, my Department invited more than 30 organisations, including organisations of growers' representatives, to submit any matters which they wished to have considered in the context of the preparation of the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">I thank the Minister of State for his answer, which seems to say that while the Government has acted on the recommendations of the review group, the consultation into which he has entered with the horticultural industry concerns how the Bill should be framed when the merger is to happen. There is considerable disquiet in the horticultural industry at the ending of Bord Glas and I ask him to enter into direct consultation with the horticultural industry to meet those concerns. The fear is that it will not be a merger but a type of silent takeover. The Government is putting together two organisations of different types, one of which is focused on food promotion and the other on the practice of agriculture or horticulture. It is a marriage that will not be to the benefit of those engaged in horticulture, which is a sector that has potential and should be supported in every possible way by the Government. On those terms I ask, prior to presenting such a Bill, how the Minister intends to engage in real and meaningful consultation with the horticultural industry?</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">My point is the same as Deputy Boyle's. It is important that the separate briefs and responsibilities of these two boards are clearly identified. The primary role of Bord Glas relates to the production of horticultural produce, which potentially has a big market here. It has not been exploited to the extent to which it should have been, but Bord Bia has primarily a marketing role. It is very important that those two identities are clearly recognised. Is there a danger that Bord Glas will be taken over by Bord Bia and that its role and responsibility, and the importance of horticultural production, will be subsumed?</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1041">It is regrettable that Bord Glas is being amalgamated with Bord Bia. I do not know whether the Minister knows this, but when was Bord Glas set up? What Minister set it up? In view of the fact that it is now being subsumed into Bord Bia, were there any weaknesses in the original mission or composition of the board?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_532" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_1042">The Minister, Deputy Walsh, the Minister of State, Deputy Aylward and I, along with our colleagues, were involved in the genesis of Bord Glas more than 15 years ago. The board was established by us in 1990; its first Minister was Deputy Kirk, who had a major role in the development of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">We are talking about structural reform. There is nothing wrong with that; we cannot stand as we are forever. I assure the House categorically that while the termination of Bord Glas as a legal entity will take effect once the legislation is passed by this House in the next Dáil term and thereafter by the Seanad, the operational functions of the board will continue. We have given public and personal guarantees to the staff that  their roles and functions will continue and that resources will continue to be made available. We have consulted more than 34 organisations, 50% of which are representative of the growers' interests. We have consulted the chief executives of Bord Bia and Bord Glas and their staff. We have consulted the various sectoral interests. We have a huge commitment to the development of horticulture, which has been a major success story over the past 15 years and has huge potential to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">We believe, on the recommendation of the expert group, that some efforts were being duplicated. Bord Bia had the responsibility for exports, including horticultural products, while Bord Glas had responsibility for the development of the industry here. We now feel that by bringing the two together to create a macro-entity with more resources available, we can centralise marketing and other functions to save money, give a better service and have more resources available to the industry. To return to Deputy Boyle's point, we have continued to support the industry. We have made grant aid available again this year for the industry and we intend to do so next year. We are committed to ensuring that the responsibilities of the board are taken care of. They will be segmented in the new structure, as Deputies Upton and Timmins have requested, to protect the interests of the industry itself and ensure there is no limit on its capacity to grow, from the point of view of both exports and domestic GNP.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1045">I would like to believe what the Minister is saying, but there have been cases in which other State bodies have amalgamated for reasons of rationalisation rather than strategic interest. I appeal to the Minister to engage in direct consultation with the horticultural industry prior to the introduction of the Bill. This year has been a particularly poor one for the industry and I suspect that people within it are feeling a little fragile about changes that will affect the future of their industry, if they are being left out of the loop .</p>

Those agencies are flagships and do wonderful work all over the world. The staff of An Bord Glas and An Bord Bia are outstanding. We are confident about these matters, having consulted widely with 34 organisations. Recently, we had a wide-ranging consultation about one sector of the industry and in the coming months we will continue to consult until the legislation has been drafted. Then the legislation will come before both Houses and I hope we will all get an opportunity to make our contributions and ensure that we pass the best practical legislation possible, which will underpin the hugely important horticultural industry.</p>

      asked the

      the steps he proposes to take to lessen the impact of the agreement reached on the CAP on the Irish dairy sector; if he will meet representatives of the dairy sector to discuss the agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [19013/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_546">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1064">The final agreement on the mid-term review of CAP was a very satisfactory conclusion as far as Ireland is concerned across the deal as a whole. It is useful to outline the specifics of the agreement in relation to milk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">First, the quota regime was extended to 2014-15, thus providing producers and processors alike with a stable environment within which to plan for the future. In the absence of agreement on MTR, the quota system was due to end automatically in 2008. The reduction in intervention price support amounted to about 4% over and above what had already been agreed under Agenda 2000 in 1999. The fact that the additional reduction is compensated for at the rate of 80% means that its actual impact is very limited. That compensation amounts to almost 5 cent per gallon of the 6 cent per gallon intervention price cut. The net effect of the price reduction and increased compensation is a reduction in the farm gate price of €14 million per year – 1% of farm gate value.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The extent to which milk prices would actually reflect the support price reduction is dependent on a number of factors, in particular, the level of prices on the market, the type and range of products produced and the extent to which milk processors and the industry generally rely on intervention as an outlet. It should be recalled that the Commission's proposal would have resulted in a cut of 10% over and above Agenda 2000 with compensation only at the rate of 56%. The completely unfounded criticism in this area are based on adding the price reduction agreed four years ago in Agenda 2000 to the price reduction of 4% agreed last week – 80% of which is compensated for.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_136">In relation to the intervention ceiling for butter, the Commission proposal would have resulted in restricting this to 30,000 tonnes from next year. Despite considerable opposition and indeed without any support, I succeeded in having that limit increased to 70,000 tonnes next year and dropping gradually so that the limit of 30,000 tonnes will not be reached until the year 2008-09. The expansion of quota at EU level, which was part of the earlier proposal and which would have put further pressure on the market, is not being  proceeded with for the present. On the issue of quota increases, Ireland has already availed of an increase of 2.86% in its quota under Agenda 2000, the benefit of which has been granted to Irish farmers over the past three years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">There is no doubt that the Irish dairy industry faces considerable challenges. The relatively modest changes introduced by the mid-term reform, beyond what was already agreed under Agenda 2000, do not change that situation in any significant way. It was in recognition of these challenges and in the context of the developments in the CAP and the WTO, that I initiated discussions with the industry last year which led to the commissioning of the Prospectus report. That report has identified weaknesses in the industry including a lack of appropriate scale for today's conditions and an over-dependence on commodity products and on intervention. The report recommends greater expenditure in research and development to allow the development of a greater range of consumer value added products.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">The key message in the report is that the success and long time survival of the industry is critically dependent on its ability to transform itself and deliver on the key strategies set out. That message is well understood by the main players in the industry. Since the publication of the report, and in an effort to drive it forward, I have had a series of meetings in the past months with representatives of most of the main processing undertakings. I propose to continue these contacts with the industry in the future and to do whatever is possible to encourage the sector to take the appropriate steps.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_139">It is, however, well recognised by those involved in the industry, and those outside it, that the ultimate decisions which are required to meet the present challenges and to reposition the industry for the future, will have to be made by the industry itself. I have no doubt that the industry will respond positively and effectively as it has done many times in the past.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      if he will ensure research is carried out and composting and vermiculture options put in place for the horse, livestock and mushroom industries.

        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_547">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">Agricultural research is primarily the responsibility of Teagasc. The principles of composting-vermicomposting are well understood and the techniques are widely applied where appropriate. Some research has already been carried out on addressing the problem of managing the 300,000 tonnes of spent mushroom compost, SMC, produced by the Irish mushroom industry annually. The results indicate that spent mushroom compost can be used with beneficial effects in field crop production and in the landscaping industry. Vermiculture was considered, but was  not deemed capable of accommodating the huge quantities of SMC involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">At farm level, my Department places high importance on the proper disposal of waste and has a number of measures in place to encourage this. Through the farm waste management scheme, grant-aid is specifically made available to farmers to improve waste-disposal facilities at farm level. Similar assistance is available through the alternative enterprises scheme for farmers involved in more diverse forms of animal husbandry, including horses, deer and goats. In all cases, assistance is primarily directed towards structural works designed to increase storage capacity, while under the farm waste management scheme, grant-aid is also available for the provision of mobile equipment for spreading.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">Neither composting nor vermiculture is specifically included for grant-aid in these two schemes, although the provision of dungsteads, which facilitates composting, is eligible for assistance. Both composting and vermiculture are more likely to be undertaken by farmers as a small on-farm enterprise, designed for onward sale of product, rather than as a means of spreading waste on their own land. In addition most of the stored animal manure from agriculture is in the form of slurry, which is an unsuitable medium for worms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">My Department also promotes environmentally-friendly waste disposal in other ways. The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, promotes the efficient use of nutrients in an environmentally friendly manner through the nutrient management plan. This involves a systematic evaluation of all nutrient sources available and required on the farm and sets limits on the application rates for animal and other wastes. The scheme of grant aid for the development of the organic sector also specifically encourages the use of production methods that do not damage the environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1073">The Egyptian market was re-opened to imports of Irish beef in late 2001. This followed an intensive political, technical and diplomatic campaign, a key part of which was a mission by an Egyptian veterinary delegation to Ireland. This mission entailed a detailed assessment of the extent and effectiveness of Ireland's food safety controls in the area of beef production from farm right through to final export. However, trade has not resumed for commercial quantities of beef largely because of certain supply conditions which were subsequently imposed by the Egyp tian authorities and which made it more difficult to allow a full commercial exploitation of the market by Irish exporters. The effect of these conditions, which involve restrictions on certain cuts of meat, are even greater when account is taken of the attractive commercial outlets elsewhere, such as the UK and continental EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">My immediate priority in relation to Egypt is to bring about a situation where the conditions of supply do not hinder or restrict trade and now that the market is open to Irish beef, intensive efforts are ongoing to bring this about. As part of this, a team of senior officials from my Department, along with representatives from An Bord Bia and the Irish Embassy in Egypt, recently held a major food safety seminar in Cairo last month to demonstrate the comprehensive nature of our food safety controls, particularly in the beef sector. This initiative was targeted at an audience of 100 key people in the areas of agriculture, food safety and food importation. The Irish delegation, as part of its overall approach, also held a range of meetings with senior Egyptian Government officials, including with the Egyptian Agriculture Minister, and Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Yousef Wali. There has been ongoing contact with the Egyptian authorities since the seminar and the indications are that the initiative was well received.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">While it is my policy that every market should be open to Irish beef and that the conditions of supply should be as flexible as possible, the actual trade is a commercial matter for our beef exporters who must negotiate appropriate supply contracts. Decisions to sell into a particular market would obviously have regard to the returns available from other markets. We have also been keeping in close contact with the European Commission about developments on the Egyptian market, with particular emphasis on the appropriate level of export refund support necessary for the supply of this important outlet for Irish beef.</p>

          <p eId="para_1077">The statement of strategy covering the period 2003-05 was launched on 9 June 2003. This is the fourth strategy statement prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Food since 1996. This statement identifies the mission, goals, outputs and related strategies that will guide the Department over the next three years. The statement of strategy was prepared by my Department as required under section 5(2) of the Public Service Management Act 1997. The strategy statement is a central element in the development of a strategic management process in the Civil Service.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_140">The statement of strategy 2003-05 was prepared in accordance with the guidelines for Ministers on implementation of the Public Service Management Act 1997 and the guidelines for the Secretary Generals and the heads of office on the preparation of the strategy statements approved by the Government in 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_141">The strategy statement has six high level goals, which are clearly focused on outcomes. They are based around our key functional areas. I will briefly refer to each of these goals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142">Goal 1: Agri-food development and trade – to develop an internationally competitive agri-food sector and support and facilitate trade in agriculture and food products. In Ireland the agri-food sector is responsible for some 8.4% of GDP. Therefore, the development of a successful agri-food sector has a significant impact on our national prosperity, net foreign earnings, employment and in particular our rural communities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_143">Goal 2: Food safety, animal health and welfare, plant health – to ensure the highest standards of food safety and consumer protection, animal health and welfare and plant health. The maintenance of high standards of animal health and welfare is an important issue. This is why it is vital that production of safe food must be underpinned by effective controls. The maintenance of high standards in these areas are important in ensuring that we have an effective base from which to continue to develop a successful agri-food industry.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">Goal 3: International framework – to achieve the optimum framework for the agri-food sector, rural economy and the natural environment at EU and at the wider international level and enhance North-South co-operation. Support for the agri-food sector, rural economy and the natural environment is provided through a variety of schemes, which are agreed at EU level. Much of the legal framework governing trade is also agreed at international level in the World Trade Organisation and other international bodies. Ireland participates in a variety of international fora to ensure that international systems accommodate our needs. Having achieved a successful conclusion to the mid-term review negotiations we now face new challenges with the Presidency of the EU, enlargement of the EU and the WTO negotiations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_145">Goal 4: Rural economy and environment – to promote the development of the rural economy and environmentally friendly and sustainable systems of agriculture and food production. The rural economy is significantly shaped by agricultural systems. We must ensure that the practice of agriculture provides a solid basis for economic and social progress in which the maximum number of farm households is maintained and that farm families can aspire to lifestyles in keeping with the general development of society.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">Goal 5: Schemes delivery and financial management – to operate all our schemes and programmes in an efficient and effective manner and ensure the highest standards of corporate and financial management and accountability in all our  activities. The Department of Agriculture and Food has led the way in the pursuit of best practice in financial management in recent years. This has included the establishment of a new accounting system, an audit committee consisting largely of external experts, and an effective internal audit function. My Department is committed to further developing our financial management systems in the period of this statement of strategy. It is dedicated to meeting increasing standards of customer service while maintaining full transparency and effective controls.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_147">Goal 6: Operational capabilities – to develop our human and physical resources and our operational capabilities and ensure the delivery of quality service to our customers, both internal and external. The Department is committed to providing services to all its customers in accordance with the principles of quality customer service as set down by the Government. It continues to review and improve the organisational structure of the Department, the work processes, systems and support services used, the information and communications strategy adopted and the mechanisms required to develop our human resources. This ensures the achievement of our goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. It also requires my Department to take a long-term strategic approach to managing limited resources.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_148">In regard to key linkages, my Department has a broad remit covering a wide range of economic and social issues. In order to implement its goals and strategies on these cross cutting issues, my Department is dependent to a large extent on a co-ordinated approach from a number of Departments and agencies. Various mechanisms are in place to facilitate the critical working relationships with the EU institutions, relevant Departments, State bodies and North-South institutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_149">The mission statement of my Department is to lead the sustainable development of a competitive, consumer focused agri-food sector and to contribute to a vibrant rural economy and society. This statement clearly expresses the values and purpose of this organisation. This statement from initial preparation to final publication has given the Department a chance to focus on its strategic goals, to consult all our customers, both internal and external, and to obtain their views. This gives it the opportunity to outline what is to happen within the Department for the coming three years. The final document embodies the proactive steps that my Department is taking to achieve the shared objectives of the Department, the goals of the programme for Government and the use of the SMI process in a way that will improve the quality, standards and relevance of service to our client base.</summary>

      asked the

          <p eId="para_1079">Under the terms of the farm improvement programme approved apple growers received grant aid to plant trees. This programme commenced in the 1970s and continued for a number of years. However, EU policy in more recent years has sought to address a mismatch between supply and demand and to improve Community production of apples and other fruits. In pursuit of this policy a premium was granted at EU level for the grubbing up of apple trees, excluding cider trees, on condition that applicants undertook to refrain from replanting any trees for a period of at least 15 years. A number of Irish growers availed of this measure while it applied. Accordingly, there is no EU aid for the replanting of apple trees. In applying grant schemes at domestic level it became necessary, therefore, to ensure that schemes for the grant aid of horticulture during the last decade were compatible with broader EU considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">The domestic apple-producing sector continues to be supported in areas other than replanting. Under round one – 2001-02 – of the NDP scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector, five apple producers were approved for investment worth €205,000 in equipment. Under round two, this year investments of €73,000 in four apple projects have been approved. In addition, a producer group consisting mainly of apple growers has been in receipt of substantial EU funding on an ongoing basis in support of its operational programme and intervention activities.</p>

          <p eId="para_1082">The Organic Development Committee in its report which was presented last year estimated that a target of 3% of land area in organic farming by 2006 was feasible. The committee also recommended that a census of organic farming should be taken at intervals and that when the first census was concluded, the results should be analysed to explore whether targets can be set for the development of individual areas within the sector. My Department is currently engaged in conducting the first census of organic farming and the results will be published in the coming months. Following detailed analysis of these results, it will be possible to review the Organic Development Committee's preliminary target of 3% of land area under organic production by 2006.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_150">The land area under organic farming in Ireland is currently less than 1%. Although the Organic Development Committee's projection of 3% by  2006 is ambitious, it is achievable. While organic farming offers real opportunities to a proportion of Irish farmers, particularly in the aftermath of the mid-term review of the CAP, I do not see any point in setting targets that do not reflect market realities and I do not believe that the German target is a useful model for the Irish sector.</summary>

The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments. My Department's proposals for the current early retirement scheme, which is one of the measures in the CAP rural development plan for the period 2000 to 2006, included provision for annual increases in pension over the period of the plan. The European Commission rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set instead. My Department then proposed a rate that was the average of the scale initially proposed.

We in Ireland have been to the forefront in developing systems and legislation in relation to the welfare of animals during transport, for example, in relation to the approval of sea going vessels carrying livestock.  In this regard, the welfare of animals during transport has always been a priority, not least because it is in the best interests of the Irish livestock sector and of future export business to ensure that animals exported from Ireland arrive at their destinations in the best possible condition. Other provisions in the proposal, such as the reduced stocking densities on livestock vehicles, present difficulties in terms of their potential effect on the volume and cost-effectiveness of the export trade from Ireland.</summary>

The total amount paid to the rendering sector since the introduction of the subsidy amounted to €146 million. While EU state aid rules permitted national Exchequers to subsidise the rendering sector in the wake of the feed ban, a course of action taken by most member states, these payments must end this year. My Department continues to have responsibility for storage and eventual destruction of the MBM accumulated in the period up to December 2002 when responsibility for the disposal of MBM produced was taken on by the sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">I have no plans to amend the current BSE depopulation system for the present, although the position is kept under ongoing review. Current EU law requires the slaughter of the entire herd, birth cohorts and progeny when a BSE case is confirmed. However, it also permits by derogation the slaughter of birth cohorts and progeny only where the epidemiological circumstances justify such an approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">In practice, other member states with substantial numbers of BSE cases avail of this derogation because it is generally accepted that from a scientific perspective the main cause of BSE is consumption of infected feedstuffs, with a theoretical possibility of maternal transmission from dam to calf. Horizontal transmission is not considered to be a significant factor in the spread of the disease. Such countries are not, however, as heavily reliant on exports as Ireland, and all have substantial domestic markets. Over time whole herd depopulation, along with the full spectrum of BSE controls operating in Ireland, have become critical elements in providing reassurance to consumers and in marketing Irish beef and dairy produce at home and abroad. In these circumstances, and while cases continue to be confirmed at current levels, it is not possible to assess precisely the market reaction to any decision to terminate Ireland's whole herd slaughter policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">In addition, a change in policy would affect individual farmers whose herds may be affected by the disease. Farmers left with animals which had been in the same herd as a BSE-positive animal would face grave difficulties in selling beef or milk to processors. All the evidence available indicates that BSE numbers here are declining and that the reduction will be maintained. Consequently net Exchequer costs of whole herd depopulation will be lower in 2003 and in future years compared with expenditure in 2002. Although savings could be achieved through adopting a partial depopulation approach, such savings must be weighed against the anticipated adverse reaction on markets, particularly in relation to third country exports, which are valued at €1.4 billion, and the impact on individual farmers. I am, however, keeping this matter under very close scrutiny.</p>

          <p eId="para_1102">The current disease eradication schemes in place for bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis comply fully with the relevant EU legislation in  place, namely Council Directive 64/432/EU, as amended. The programme has been successful in reducing the level of tuberculosis from 17% of animals in 1955 to 0.3% of animals today. The maintenance of this low level of disease makes it possible for Ireland to trade with other countries and as 90% of bovines are exported in one form or another this is of immense benefit to the Irish economy. In the past three years the number of TB reactors has reduced from 39,847 to 28,930, a decrease of 27%. However, further progress towards final eradication is constrained by the presence of a wildlife reservoir of infection. The four-area badger study has just been completed and the final report on the result of the study is in the process of being prepared for publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">Brucellosis has also improved, with a 48% reduction in the number of newly restricted herds and the number of herd depopulations for the first five months of 2003 compared with similar data for 2000. Further progress is anticipated but it must be borne in mind that this disease is extremely contagious and continued vigilance is required. My Department has an ongoing research programme and liaises with international bodies and organisations in relation to developments in TB and brucellosis eradication.</p>

          <p eId="para_1106">The impact of decoupling will depend on the form of decoupling to be implemented. As the agreement reached by the Council of Ministers provides for the option of full decoupling and for various partial decoupling options, I will shortly commence a process of consultation with the social partners and any other interested groups and individuals before deciding on which option to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">The Commission's proposals on digression of direct payments, which would have reduced direct payments to Irish farmers by €56 million annually, have been withdrawn. The proposals have been replaced by a mechanism, to commence in 2007, whereby the Council will decide what adjustments may be necessary to ensure that the annual expenditure ceilings are respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">The agreement reached on modulation of direct payments provides for a modulation rate of 3% in 2005, 4% in 2006 and 5% in subsequent years. The first €5,000 per year of a farmer's direct payments will not be affected. Ireland will effectively retain about 85% of modulated funds for use for on-farm rural development measures.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_153">In relation to the milk sector, the agreement provides for a reduction of 4% in the overall intervention price implemented through a 10%  reduction in the butter intervention price and a zero reduction in the intervention price for skimmed milk powder. Compensation, in the form of an increase in the dairy cow premium, will amount of 80% of the loss calculated on the assumption that the market price will fall fully in line with the intervention price. On that basis, the net loss is estimated at €14 million a year or about 1% of the farm-gate value of milk output. Of course, this loss can be avoided if the Irish dairy industry replaces intervention sales with sales on higher-priced markets. A crucially important element of the agreement was the extension of the milk quota regime, which was due to end in 2008, until 2014-15.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_154">In the case of cereals, the Commission had proposed a 5% reduction in the intervention price and the abolition of the monthly increments to that price. The agreement reached by the Council was that there would be no reduction in the intervention price and that the monthly increments would be reduced by 50%. The net effect on cereal prices is estimated to be negligible.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_155">The result of the negotiations for Irish agriculture is, I believe, resoundingly positive. The options in relation to decoupling will enable us to determine the system of direct payments most suited to our needs. The arrangements will enable a substantial proportion of the EU's direct payments to qualify as domestic support which has, in WTO terms, "no or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production" and so protect them from challenge in the current WTO negotiations. As a result, the EU's negotiating position will be considerably strengthened and the security of direct payments to Irish farmers has been significantly enhanced for the future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_156">In relation to the individual sectors, the outcome was also particularly satisfactory. The small loss in the milk sector of 1% – or one cent per gallon – can be avoided by foregoing intervention and selling our products on higher priced markets. The extension to 2014-15 of the quota regime, which has been crucially instrumental in maintaining dairy farmers incomes in the past, will be of major benefit.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">It is clear, therefore, that the agreement reached by the Council on the mid-term review is a good one, both for European and Irish agriculture. It offers a firm basis for the future development of the sector which I intend to exploit to the full for the benefit of our farmers and our rural communities.</summary>

Apart from the environmental benefit, there is a large market to be exploited and the economic and strategic value of a secure indigenous fuel supply would be substantial.

I particularly welcome the agreement under the mid-term review for the introduction of a new stand-alone payment of €45 per hectare for the growing of energy crops, and I hope that this payment will encourage the further growth of these crops.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1121">The main provisions of REPS are set out in the CAP Rural Development Plan 2000-2006, and substantial changes require the approval of the European Commission. I intend to submit proposals for amendments to REPS to the European Commission later in 2003. In order to ensure the views of all stakeholders are taken into consideration in formulating these proposals, I launched a consultative process on REPS in October 2002. More than 50 submissions were received, covering a wide range of issues. My officials then held a series of meeting with the parties who had made submissions, and the consultative process culminated with an open forum on 4 June in which the various stakeholders took part, along with officials of my Department and the European Commission. A wide ranging and  very useful discussion took place touching on all aspects of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">Following the consultation process, my officials are currently drafting proposals for amendments to the scheme which will be submitted to the European Commission later in the year. In making proposals to the Commission for amendments to REPS, one of my priorities will be to make the scheme simpler and more user-friendly. With this in view, I have made certain changes to the administrative provisions of REPS to simplify scheme documentation. REPS planners are no longer required to check ownership documentation for privately owned land that is declared for payment under the scheme, and I introduced a simplified format for farm plans that is optional for farmers with extensive farming systems. The simplified REPS plan will enable the REPS planner to set out clearly an annual programme of works under each of the existing REPS measures, in a straightforward way, which will leave the farmer in no doubt as to what he or she has to do during the course of the REPS agreement.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_159">In January 2003, I secured the agreement of the European Commission to two changes to the scheme designed to make it easier for transferees to continue to meet their commitments, and thus to safeguard the pensions of retired farmers. The changes limited the obligations on the transferee to have enlargement land and to engage in farming as a main occupation to the first five years participation in the scheme. Once the transferee has satisfied these conditions for five years they cease to apply. The transferee must continue to farm the pension lands, the lands transferred by the retiring farmer, for the full period of the pension, but not necessarily as a main occupation.  These changes were welcomed by the main farming organisations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_160">The current scheme of early retirement commenced in November 2000 and is governed by the rural development Council Regulation 1257/1999. I have since secured the Commission's agreement to a change in this scheme. When it was being formulated in 1999, the Commission insisted that the widow's and widower's pension be regarded as national retirement pensions for the purposes of the scheme, regardless of the age of the recipient. It is an EU requirement that national retirement pensions must be offset against pensions paid under the early retirement scheme. Early in 2002, however, the Commission acceded to my representations that the widow's and widower's pensions should not be regarded as national retirement pensions until the recipient reached the national retirement age of 66. This change was made with retrospective effect and resulted in refunds being paid to a number of participants.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">A number of changes to the current scheme that did not require formal Commission approval were included in a re-draft of the scheme document in May 2002. Most of these changes were for clarification purposes only, but two changes in particular were to the benefit of prospective applicants. One of these was a change in the way non-farm income is reckoned in joint ownership cases; the non-farming spouse or partner's off-farm income is no longer taken into account. The other change made in 2002 was that a revocation clause may now be included in leases of pension lands and may be invoked once the pension has been paid for five years.</summary>

The reduction in the value of output was primarily in the cattle and milk sectors. This was caused by a combination of wet weather, a drop in livestock slaughterings from their high levels in 2001 and lower prices, especially for dairy products. The drop in livestock output is partly a reflection of the fact that 2001 was a particularly good year as the FMD crisis in the UK removed much of their beef and sheep production from the market place which indirectly benefited Irish producers.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_162">These output figures do not include the value of direct payments which increased by 19% in 2002 to more than €1.6 billion. The payment increases were agreed under Agenda 2000 to compensate for reductions in market support mechanisms. With the reduction of traditional  market supports such as intervention and export subsidies the main challenge for the agri-food sector will be to add maximum value to the volume of primary production. This can be done by meeting consumer demands and by being competitive on both EU and international markets. The national development plan, which allocated €4.9 billion to the agri-food sectors, contains a range of measures to promote market orientation, productivity and innovation in agriculture and food.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1143">While considerable analysis has been carried out on various aspects of EU Commission proposals the economic impact of the outcome of the mid-term review agreement in food producing countries is not known at present. The mid-term review agreement contains a broad range of changes in the direction of the CAP which will be implemented over the period 2004 to 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">The most fundamental aspect of the agreement relates to the options for decoupling or partial decoupling. Each member state will have to decide between the menu of options available. Only when these decisions are made in regard to the particular options will the potential economic impact become clearer. Furthermore, the consequential production decisions taken by individual farmers will also be important factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">The FAPRI Ireland study published in May of this year and based on the mid term review proposals at that time showed a possible decrease in beef production of 6%, sheep production down 5% and aggregate farm income up 8% by 2012. This study found that a majority of farmers would be better off and the industry as a whole more competitive and efficient, as the motivation to continue market-loss making enterprises would be removed. Further study is, however, required following the agreement on the mid term review reached last week by the Council of Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1151">The European Commission has now published proposals for a harmonised system of sheep identification. This proposal is based on individual identification, use of movement documents and registers, a central database and, ultimately, electronic identification. Many of the elements in this proposal are already in place in Ireland as part of the comprehensive national sheep identification system, NSIS, introduced in June 2001. I am satisfied that all elements of NSIS are working well. I have consistently indicated that it would however be open to refinement and further development in the light of operational experience and to accommodate emerging demands and changing circumstances. In that context, the prospect of a harmonised system at EU level obviously holds potential for some change to aspects of NSIS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">While much of the detail of the European Commission proposals will be need to be discussed and examined in the coming months to assess its practical application and while I have concerns about many of the detailed aspects, I can support the broad principle which underlies the Commission's thinking – the need across the European Union for a robust, harmonised system of sheep identification backed up with good record-keeping allowing full traceability of animal movements at all times.</p>

          <p eId="para_1157">Last year, approximately 26,000 tonnes of Irish skimmed milk powder, which is the equivalent of 82 million gallons of milk, was used in the manufacture of infant nutritional products. This accounts for over 25% of our annual SMP production and acts as a valuable outlet for Irish milk powder. Taking the current SMP intervention price of €2,055.20 per tonne, the value of this to Irish processors is at least €53 million. Of course, one would expect the actual price received by processors to be higher. In addition, over 8,000 tonnes of Irish whey powder and nearly 12,000 tonnes of Irish lactose were also sold into the infant nutritional sector last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The strong infant nutritional presence in Ireland brings direct benefits to both milk producers and dairy processors as suppliers of inputs, and provides a value added alternative for Irish dairy produce.

The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed and the declining numbers of BSE cases are positive indications that the additional controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline as older animals leave the system.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1170">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 42 and 52 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">In July 2002, I established a group to examine the whole food labelling issue. The group reported in December 2002 making a series of recommendations. I accepted the recommendations and set up an interdepartmental agency group to progress implementation of the recommendations. This group includes representatives from my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Food Safety Promotion Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">I am very pleased at the progress in the implementation of the recommendations of the group in the six months since the report was presented to me. Two main issues emanated from the recommendations of the labelling group. They are centralising enforcement in one agency and the definition of origin. In relation to centralisation of enforcement, the position is that the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health and Children recently agreed to the transfer of responsibility for general food labelling from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the Department of Health and Children. This move provides the opportunity to centralise the enforcement of all labelling regulations in the FSAI, which comes under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_165">On the question of definition of origin, there was full agreement within the food labelling group that consumers have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat out. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in this  area. I asked the consumer liaison panel to devise a strategy for consumer research on this issue. Following receipt of that strategy I provided funding for the research and the consumer liaison panel has sought tenders to carry it out. I expect that the research will commence shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_166">In addition to those already mentioned, the group made a number of other very useful recommendations. I will briefly summarise progress on these. The food labelling group recognised the concerns of consumers that there needed to be clearer information on labels in relation to allergens. New EU legislation on this issue is at an advanced stage. I am hopeful that this will be in place within the year. I have requested the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to incorporate a module of food safety-labelling-consumer issues into the primary and secondary school curricula.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_167">The group's recommendation in relation to informing the consumer of the price per weight unit was addressed in legislation brought in by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in March. The labelling group emphasised the responsibility of the food sector to produce safe food and to provide on all food and drink labels information that is clear, accurate and easy to read. I expect the Food and Drinks Industry of Ireland of IBEC to issue a guide to industry on this within the next couple of weeks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_168">The report of the food labelling group recognised that there is confusion about the term "substantial transformation" as used when defining the origin of a food product. I have arranged to have the food labelling report referred to the European Commission and have sought clarification from the Commission on a definition of this term. It must be remembered that food labelling is a particularly complicated and broad based area. My primary aim is to protect consumer interest and to ensure that the consumer is properly informed. Ireland is a major exporter of food and food products and indeed there are also considerable imports, so it is imperative that the same standards are applied to the labelling of foods in every sector and that there is a level playing field for the food industry at all levels.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1177">In December 2001, I published the Agri-Food Implementation Report, which outlined the progress of the Agri-Food 2010 Plan of Action. In all 94% of the action points have been completed or have seen substantial action completed. My Department's statement of strategy and the plan of action contain commitments for overseeing the further implementation of the Agri-Food 2010 Committee's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">I have given a commitment, and it has been set down in the agriculture chapter in the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, to re-examine the Agri-Food 2010 report and to update it in the light of developments under the mid-term review and WTO. I have also commissioned a study on competitiveness which was presented to me in October 2002. I am arranging for further analysis to be done in this area in the height of the more challenging international environment. On an ongoing basis I shall continue to pursue policies and operate programmes, both EU and national, which will enable farm families to enjoy living standards in line with general economic and social development and maintain an agri-food sector which is profitable, competitive, sustainable and innovative.</p>

          <p eId="para_1180">EU regulations define fresh meat, including lamb, as meat which has not undergone any treatment other than cold treatment to ensure preservation. Cold treatment can include freez ing. Those regulations also require meat, which has undergone a freezing process, to bear an indication of the month and year in which it was frozen. This particular provision is to ensure that the ultimate purchaser is aware of the status of meat prior to the sale.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">Responsibility for ensuring compliance with EU meat hygiene regulations at export approved slaughter plants is a matter for my Department, at domestic abattoirs it is a matter for the local authorities while responsibility for controls at retail level is a matter for the health boards.

One of the recommendations of the food labelling group, which I set up last year, was that the control of food labelling should be centralised in the FSAI and this is now under way.</p>

          <p eId="para_1184">Botulism is not a notifiable disease under the Diseases of Animals Acts. However, samples from animals may be submitted for testing to my Department's central veterinary laboratory or regional veterinary laboratories at the discretion of a private veterinary practitioner or on request by a herdowner through his or her private veterinary practitioner. Recently, the attention of farmers was drawn again to the botulism problem and advice was given on precautions which should be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">Botulism is caused by a bacterium called clostridium botulinum that causes harmful effects by producing a toxin. There are five types of the botulism toxin, A, B, C, D and E. Types C and D are common to cattle. Bovine botulism can be contracted by contact with contaminated decomposing organic material such as poultry litter which contain dead poultry carcases when spread on land grazed by cattle. The recently adopted EU Animal By-Product Regulations (No. 1774/2002) forbids the spreading of organic material other than farmyard manure on pasture land. This would include chicken carcass material which must be removed from litter before spreading.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_169">While humans may be affected by botulism, it should be noted that the specific toxins implicated in the conditions in humans are not those normally associated with the condition in cattle. It is also generally accepted that humans are resistant to the types of toxin that affect cattle. Furthermore, these toxin types are poorly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and the toxins themselves are inactivated by heat treatment. The risk to human health from consumption of milk or meat from cattle on farms with  cases of botulism, therefore, appears to be remote. However, as a precautionary measure, farmers are advised to wear gloves, wash their hands thoroughly after handling poultry litter and avoid unnecessary contact with the material.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_170">Last year, my Department wrote to dairy processors advising them about the condition and asking them to distribute to their producers an information/advisory note entitled "Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Litter on Land". In the same way, poultry processors were also circulated with a similar information/advisory note. An information note on botulism for veterinary practitioners and instructions for practitioners when dealing with suspected cases of botulism on farm was also circulated to private veterinary practitioners by district veterinary offices and copies of an information/advisory note entitled Good Farming Practice with regard to Spreading Poultry Litter on Land are available to farmers from district veterinary offices. My Department is currently taking steps to again remind those in the relevant sectors of the preventative measures that need to be taken.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1188">In so far as the scrapie depopulation policy is concerned, I indicated that I would, for the present, be retaining whole-flock depopulation, although depopulated flocks may be restocked with sheep after a minimum de-contamination period – usually one month – unless there is veterinary advice that the level of exposure to scrapie on the holding or other epidemiological factors indicate that a longer period is warranted. Restocking is subject to adherence to a cleansing and disinfection protocol, use of resistant rams in the new flock and record keeping requirements. Replacement female sheep which do not have specified levels of resistance will not be allowed to enter the food chain.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_171">In relation to genotyping, my Department has almost completed a survey of rams in the various pedigree breeds, which will generate data on resistance to scrapie among the breeds in the national flock. The data gathered from this exercise will be of assistance in the development of programmes for breeding for scrapie resistance in pedigree flocks which are required to be in place by 1 January 2004. In this context, my Department is putting in place a framework whereby flockowners will be able to have their animals geno-typed and certified. As part of this initiative, the Department has invited expressions of interest from private laboratories to provide a  geno-typing service to certification standards to farmers on a commercial basis. A number of expressions of interest have been received and criteria for the approval of applicant laboratories are currently being finalised.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">In addition to the foregoing, scrapie will continue to be a notifiable disease and the nationwide active surveillance programme will continue. The policies in relation to scrapie will continue to be kept under review and further developments including the possibility of partial depopulation of infected flocks will be considered in the contexts of increasing genotyping capacity, the availability of a stock of scrapie resistant replacement sheep, evolving scientific knowledge of scrapie and genetic resistance, developments at EU level and other relevant factors.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1195">It is a basic requirement of relevant EU and national legislation that all animal medicines must be appropriately authorised and manufactured in premises which hold an appropriate manufacturing license. The authorisation regime is designed to ensure that only medicines, in respect of which it has been possible to demonstrate quality, safety and efficacy to the appropriate scientific standard, reach the market. Protection of public and animal health and welfare are the basis for these controls.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">Other features of the regime include a requirement that approved medicines must be labelled in a specified manner and that such labels must show the relevant licence number. Furthermore, authorised medicines may only be sold through authorised outlets which themselves have an obligation to source products only from similarly authorised outlets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">At the time the national legislation was significantly updated by means of the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996, there was extensive publicity about the requirements, which included seminars conducted by my Department throughout the country. The requirements in relation to medicines are also reflected in quality assurance schemes which have been developed by An Bord Bia in recent years. During the course of the last month, Teagasc has issued a very helpful guide to the safe use of medicines which was drawn up in consultation with a number of organisations, including my Department, and which is available from all Teagasc offices or may be downloaded from its website.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">In the final analysis, I must point to the primary responsibility on farmers to ensure that they only use authorised medicines and that they obtain them from an authorised source.</p>

          <p eId="para_1209">Under the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural Policy, additional cuts in the intervention price support amount to approximately 4% when compared to the Agenda 2000 agreement. This adjustment is compensated by way of direct payment to dairy farmers which amounts to about 80% of that reduction. That compensation amounts to almost 5 cent per gallon of the 6 cent per gallon intervention price cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">As regards the impact on producer incomes this depends on the extent to which the reduction in price supports is reflected in the price of milk. If the reduction was fully reflected in the milk price then the additional 4% cut would involve a reduction totalling approximately €14 million, when the 80% compensation is taken into account. The extent to which milk prices will reflect the reduction in support price levels is dependent on a number of factors, in particular the level of prices on the market, and the type and range of products produced and marketed, and the extent to which the milk processors and the industry generally, relies on intervention as an outlet.</p>

          <p eId="para_1212">A total of 105 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date in 2003, including one case from a depopulated herd. This represents a reduction of 43% on the corresponding period in 2002 when 185 cases, including two cases from depopulated herds, were confirmed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_174">In both 2002 and 2003, some 98% of cases were identified in animals aged six years or more at the time of diagnosis, compared with 84% and 60% in that category in 2001 and 2000 respectively. The increasing age profile of animals in which the  disease is confirmed and the declining numbers of BSE cases are positive indications that the enhanced controls in relation to meat and bonemeal, specified risk material and the processing of mammalian waste products introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline as older animals leave the system. It is however likely that cases will continue to be identified for several years yet as many cases continue to be identified in animals aged ten years or older.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_175">The current controls are working well but are subject to ongoing review by my Department, having regard to various factors. This process embraces all aspects of the current control measures and seeks to ensure that as time passes and relevant circumstances evolve they continue to address any areas of identified risk, consolidate and protect progress made to date in tackling the disease and further the objective of eliminating it from the national herd.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_176">Prior to the BSE crisis in mainland Europe late in 2000, Ireland had recovered many of its traditionally important third country export markets which had closed as a consequence of the earlier crisis in 1996. Following the crisis in 2000, which arose from developments in other member states, a number of countries imposed Europe-wide bans on beef imports. There has never been a restriction on Irish beef within the EU due to BSE.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_177">It is my policy and that of the Government that Irish beef should be free to enter any market where exporters consider there are commercial possibilities. Where there are restrictions due to BSE, every effort has been made and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to have them removed. As a consequence of these efforts, Egypt, which had been our largest market for beef, lifted the ban on Irish beef imports in October 2001, and the resumption of exports is now a commercial matter for the industry. Intensive efforts are continuing in relation to other traditional markets for Irish beef which remain closed to us, such as the Gulf States, South Africa and Indonesia.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_178">Despite the difficulties brought about by BSE, exports of Irish beef have been at a very satisfactory level with the UK market in particular recording huge growth over the past two years. Russia has been the next most important market in terms of volume while France, Netherlands, Italy and Sweden remain strong. Nonetheless it would be desirable to have more markets available which would results in greater competition for Irish beef.</summary>

To date 15 of the recommendations have been implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations. Also included are the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Government has recently approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing. It is hoped to enact the legislation by year-end. My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace.

          <p eId="para_1255">In recognition of the unacceptably high fatality and accident rate in the agricultural sector the Health and Safety Authority set up a farm safety action group in February 2002. Its terms of reference include "the development of a national action programme, co-ordinating the actions of the representative organisations and assigning tasks". In April 2003, the group produced and published the Farm Safety Plan 2003-2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">This plan sets specific targets, against a base year of 2001, including a reduction by 50% in farm fatalities with no child fatalities, a reduction by almost 50% in the farm accident rate to less than 1,600 per annum and an increase from 10% to 50% of farmers complying with health and safety legislation. The plan recognises the need for a range of activities to achieve these targets and has adopted an approach based on engineering controls, enforcement and education and training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">Central to the success of the plan is the development of a safety partnership between all of the interested parties to develop and co-ordinate the approach contained in the plan and for the parties to have given a written commitment to their contribution to the implementation of the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">The Health and Safety Authority is committed to undertake a minimum of 1,000 farm inspections in the current year, with appropriate enforcement action and follow up inspection being taken where necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">Following the publication of the farm safety plan, the Health and Safety Authority has established the farm safety action group as a standing committee of the board of the authority as the farm safety partnership to ensure that the plan is progressed and kept under review.</p>

          <p eId="para_1277">The final agreement on the CAP mid-term review was a satisfactory conclusion as far as Ireland is concerned across the deal as a whole. It is useful to outline the specifics of the agreement in relation to milk. The quota regime was extended to 2014-15, thus providing producers and processors alike with a stable environment within which to plan for the future. In the absence of agreement on MTR the quota system was due to end automatically in 2008. The reduction in intervention price support amounted to about 4% over and above what had already been agreed under Agenda 2000 in 1999. The fact that the  additional reduction is compensated for at the rate of 80% means that its actual impact is limited. The extent to which milk prices will reflect the support price reduction is dependent on a number of factors, in particular the level of prices on the market, the type and range of products produced and the extent to which milk processors and the industry generally rely on intervention as an outlet. The Commission's proposal would have resulted in a cut of 10% over and above Agenda 2000 with compensation only at the rate of 56%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">In relation to the intervention ceiling for butter, the Commission proposal would have resulted in restricting this to 30,000 tonnes from next year. Despite considerable opposition and no support I succeeded in having that limit increased to 70,000 tonnes next year and dropping gradually so that the limit of 30,000 tonnes will not be reached until the year 2008-9. This will allow the industry a certain amount of time and space to adjust.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">The expansion of quota at EU level, which was part of the earlier proposal and which would have put further pressure on the market, is not being proceeded with for the present. On the issue of quota increases, Ireland has already availed of an increase of 2.86% in its quota under Agenda 2000, the benefit of which has been granted to Irish farmers over the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">There is no doubt that the Irish dairy industry faces considerable challenges. The relatively modest changes introduced by the MTR, beyond what was already agreed under Agenda 2000, do not change that situation in any significant way. It was in recognition of these challenges, and in the context of the developments in the CAP and the WTO, that I initiated discussions with the industry which led to the commissioning of the Prospectus report. It identified weaknesses in the industry including a lack of appropriate scale for today's conditions and an over dependence on commodity products and on intervention. It also recommends greater expenditure in research and development to allow the development of a greater range of consumer-value added products.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">The report's key message is that the success and long-term survival of the industry is critically dependant on its ability to transform itself and deliver on the key strategies set out. That message is understood by the main players in the industry. Since the publication of the report, and in an effort to move it forward, I have had a series of meetings with representatives of most of the main processing undertakings. I shall continue these contacts with the industry in the future and I shall encourage it to take the appropriate steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">It is well recognised by those involved in the industry, and those outside it, that the ultimate decisions which are required to meet the present challenges and to reposition the industry for the future, will have to be made by the industry. The industry will respond positively and effectively as it has done many times in the past.</p>

          <p eId="para_1285">To this end my Department has established a wildlife unit that will oversee all wildlife removal operations here.

          <p eId="para_1286">The number of badgers examined in 2001 was below target due to the foot and mouth disease outbreak. The number of badgers removed last year was significantly higher.

          <p eId="para_1311">Beef and other meats are imported for further processing such as cutting and packaging in retail cuts or for inclusion in meat based food products. Ireland exports more meat and meat products than it imports. It is important that, other than the controls referred to below, no restraints be put on trade in meat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">Under the Single Market there is free circulation of goods within the EU but there are uniform EU wide controls on the production and trade in meat and food based on animal products. Under Community law it is a requirement that all such products must be sourced from an approved establishment. Import of meat and foods based on animal products must also be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or health certificate that bears the identity of the establishment from which the beef has been despatched.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Under EU harmonised rules, imports into the EU from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's food and veterinary office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks on import laid down in harmonised rules prescribed at European level. They must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">Consignments coming from third countries must be imported through an approved border inspection post upon first entry into the EU. An official health certificate conforming to model certificates set down in EU legislation must be presented. Goods failing to comply with the veterinary control checks may be detained for further examination and, if necessary, they may be destroyed. Once these products have met all of the required conditions they are released for free circulation within the European Community.

          <p eId="para_1316">Direct payments which are decoupled from production should qualify as domestic support which has, in WTO terms "no, or at most, minimal trade distorting effects or effects on production," the so-called Green Box, and should be free from challenge in the WTO. Until member states decide which of the options for decoupling to implement it is not possible to indicate the total amount of EU direct payments which should qualify for the Green Box.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">The changes agreed for the various sectors such as milk, cereals and rice should reduce the EU's level of domestic support which is subject to a ceiling in the WTO, the Amber Box, and the levels of export subsidy which are also subject to a ceiling. At this stage it is not possible to estimate the extent of these reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">While the full WTO implications of the agreement reached by the Council of Ministers have yet to be quantified, it is clear that the agreement will considerably strengthen the EU's negotiating position in the forthcoming WTO negotiations in Cancun in September.</p>

          <p eId="para_1320">The McKinsey report on the beef industry identified significant over capacity in the processing sector. It found that average weekly cattle slaughter is 32,000 head, rising to 45,000 head at peak period, while overall slaughtering capacity is of the order of 66,000 head. In November 1998 I established the beef task force which consisted of representatives of all those connected to the beef industry. The task force endorsed the finding of McKinsey in relation to over capacity and recommended that this be addressed in the interests of long-term competitiveness. The beef processing industry has developed a rationalisation plan which is being examined by the Competition Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">As regards the pigmeat sector, the Prospectus study of the pig industry found that there was significant excess slaughter capacity and that this was impairing the competitiveness of the sector. This study was conducted prior to the fire at the Rooskey plant and the withdrawal of a couple of smaller operators from the business. Some 3.04 million pigs were slaughtered in 2002, a decline of 5% on the previous year. Indications so far this year are that slaughtering is down by around 8%. I am satisfied that pig slaughtering capacity is adequate for the current supply of pigs.</p>

Other markets open to Irish beef include Cyprus, Malta, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Egypt although the latter is not taking commercial quantities of Irish beef.

          <p eId="para_1329">Consumption in EU markets has now recovered following the last BSE crisis. There is potential for Irish beef exports to those markets to continue to increase. The UK market, in particular as a destination for Irish beef, has recorded huge growth during the past two years and it is likely to remain strong this year. Last year exports to the UK amounted to some 250,000 tonnes. Markets in France, Netherlands, Italy and Sweden also remain strong. After the UK, Russia is the single most important market for Irish beef having taken some 83,000 tonnes in 2002 and it is anticipated that exports there in 2003 will continue to perform strongly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1332">The deer industry is stronger both financially and structurally than it was five years ago.

          <p eId="para_1335">The primary responsibility for ensuring that Irish beef and lamb command premium prices on international markets and within the EU rests with the processing industry, with the support of An Bord Bia. There are no technical restrictions on the export of beef and lamb within the EU. A substantial quantity of both products are exported annually to EU member states. In the past two years exports of beef to the UK recorded huge growth. I expect that 250,000 tonnes of beef will be exported to the UK again this year. The markets on continental Europe, notably France, the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden continue to strengthen. The industry will continue its focus on achieving a greater level of penetration of EU markets generally while targeting higher value segments of these markets in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">As regards third country markets for beef, Russia remains the main export market, having taken 83,000 tonnes last year. I expect that this will continue though other markets open to Irish beef include Egypt, Cyprus, Malta, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Where there are restrictions due to BSE on beef exports to other markets, including the Gulf states, South Africa and Indonesia, every effort has been made, and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to have them removed. There remains some technical restrictions preventing the full resumption of the commercial trade with Egypt and I am working intensively to have these amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">My role in relation to beef and lamb prices generally is to set the policy parameters, to negotiate the appropriate support framework at EU level and to ensure unrestricted access to all markets. I pressed hard to secure the recent decision at EU level to adopt a framework Regulation allowing for the introduction of mechanical classification. My Department has set a process in motion which will lead to machine classification at processing plants next year. This development will allow factories to focus more intensely on rewarding quality product and to expand the market opportunities internationally for Irish beef.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">Commercial considerations also arise in respect of all markets. Irish beef faces stiff competition from South America, in particular, to retain and expand market opportunities. The industry needs to intensify its focus on both quality and price in order to improve its international competitiveness and sharpen its appeal to consumers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1342">My mission as Minister for Agriculture and Food is to lead the sustainable development of a competitive, consumer focused agri-food sector and to contribute to a vibrant rural economy and society. In June 1999, to assist with the development of a future strategy for the sector I established the Agri-2010 committee to examine the challenges ahead and propose a future strategy for the sector. In response to its report I published the Agri-food 2010 – plan of action which contained 197 specific action points to achieve a dynamic agri-food sector which would form the basis of thriving rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">The main instrument for the delivery of these strategies is the funding contained in the national development plan. A sum of €8.5 billion has been allocated over the period 2000-06 in actions that directly impact on rural areas. This includes provisions of €4.9 billion for measures such as REPS, compensatory allowances and the early retirement scheme in the CAP rural development plan and other measures in various operational programmes to improve research and development, productivity and market orientation in the agri-food sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">Annual expenditure by my Department of approximately €2.9 billion is all used either directly or indirectly in support of agriculture which is the primary driving force in the development of rural areas. Of this €1.6 billion is in the form of direct payments which directly supports farm incomes and contributes to the viability of both full and part-time farms.</p>

          <p eId="para_1426">The Civil Service policy in relation to paternity leave entitles a father to three days special leave with pay on the birth or adoption of his child. This policy has been in place in the Civil Service since 1 January 2000. There are no plans to introduce any new initiatives in this area. In addition, civil servants who are parents are entitled to avail of parental leave consisting of 14 weeks unpaid leave for each child up to six years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">Paternity leave is one of the many work-life balance schemes in the human resource management policy for the Civil Service. It has been to the forefront in introducing initiatives to support work-life balance for all staff. Other schemes available to civil servants are worksharing – staff may avail of part-time work options such as a three or four day week or a shorter working day; term-time – parents may take ten or 13 weeks unpaid leave to match their children's summer holidays; flexitime, which gives staff flexibility to vary their starting and finishing times; career breaks under which staff may take up to two periods of five years leave without pay for domestic reasons, including child care; and special leave for domestic purposes whereby staff may avail of up to six months unpaid leave to care for an ill spouse or child. Pilot teleworking initiatives are also under way in a number of Departments and offices.</p>

      asked the

      when the programme of decentralisation of Departments will begin; when the announcements of the towns to which Departments will be decentralised will be made; and if he will make a statement on the progress of the whole project in terms of the consultative and selection process.

          <p eId="para_1436">The Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. A wide range of important issues, including the national spatial strategy, must be considered before a final decision is taken on a new programme of decentralisation. It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. Given the wide range of considerations it is not possible for me to state at this time when the Government will be in a position to take a decision on this matter. It would be inappropriate for me to pre-empt that decision by prematurely nominating a Department, office or location at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1441">I set out in detail the tax treatment applied by the Revenue Commissioners in such cases in my reply to an earlier question in the House on 28 May. This treatment is not new or unusual and is in line with the treatment of normal trading activities and is in accordance with relevant accountancy standards. That tax treatment has been applied to the PPPs completed to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">The same treatment would be applied outside of a public private partnership arrangement if a similar arrangement existed between two private parties.

          <p eId="para_1628">Section 140 of the Finance Act 2003 gave legislative effect to the stamp duty increase from €19 to €40 per annum on credit card accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1629">Under the previous legislation the stamp duty on credit cards was in respect of an account maintained by the bank on 1 April and people could cancel their cards in a particular manner so as to avoid the annual charge. An anti-avoidance provision for credit cards was included in the Finance Act 2003. It ensures that a stamp duty charge will arise where the account is maintained by the bank at any time during the 12 month period ending on 1 April rather than being maintained specifically on 1 April. This change is effective where the charge arises after 1 April.</p>
          <p eId="para_1630">If an individual, having used a card at any time, cancels the credit card after 1 April in a year, a further stamp duty charge of €40 is payable on closure of the account, as the account had been maintained by the financial institution during the year ending on 1 April of the following year. This is consistent with applying a stamp duty charge for a year or part of a year for which the credit card account is held.</p>
          <p eId="para_1631">There would be Revenue implications in any change to the current provisions. I intend to keep this matter under consideration in the context of the 2004 budget and Finance Bill, which is the normal context for any changes in taxation arrangements.</p>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1662">The United Nations Security Council unanimously determined in Resolution 1441 of November 2002 that "Iraq's non-compliance with Council resolutions and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles" posed a threat to international peace and security. This resolution was the culmination of a succession of resolutions stretching back 12 years to the end of the first Gulf War. The decisions of the Security Council, under Article 25 of the UN Charter are  binding on all members. The Government's position in relation to the question of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction has always rested on its commitment to the United Nations, rather than on claims put forward by individual member states of the UN.</p>
          <p eId="para_1663">Subsequent to this resolution and when faced with the threat of force, Iraq accepted the return of the inspectors. However the degree of co-operation extended by Iraq to the inspectors was described by them as less than full. The reports of the inspectors made it clear that many questions remained unanswered in relation to Iraq's holdings of weapons of mass destruction. At the beginning of June, the UN weapons inspectors delivered a report for the period ending 31 May. As with all previous reports from the inspectors, it was balanced and cautious. The inspectors reported that they had found no evidence that Iraq's former weapons programmes had been resumed or continued. However, they also concluded that important questions remained unanswered about Iraq's existing holdings of weapons and materials. Regardless of whether weapons of mass destruction are discovered in Iraq, the fact that the mandate of the arms inspectors remained unfulfilled at the time of the US-led invasion will remain unaltered. The fact that no weapons of mass destruction have been discovered since the invasion of Iraq raises significant questions about the motives of the Iraqi Government in refusing to extend full co-operation to the inspectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1664">The transit through Shannon Airport of US military aircraft and chartered civilian aircraft carrying US military personnel is a longstanding practice, subject to the criteria that the aircraft are unarmed and not carrying arms, ammunition, explosives or intelligence gathering equipment. The continued provision of landing facilities during the conflict in Iraq was considered in the light of the principles that underpin our foreign policy, the longstanding nature of our arrangements with the US, our international relations and our broader national interests. The Government's decision to maintain existing arrangements was taken after long reflection and was approved by Dáil Éireann. I am satisfied that it was the right one in the circumstances.</p>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the situation with regard to human rights defenders in West Papua including the repression of Papuan human rights defenders and interference with international observers and United Nations human rights mechanisms; if he has raised these issues with the Government of Indonesia; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1668">On a number of occasions recently, I set out the Government's position with reference to the situation in Papua. I am aware of reports of difficulties being experienced by human rights defenders and international monitors in Papua. The Government regards the safety and freedom of human rights workers as an integral part of the promotion and protection of human rights. At the April meeting of the EU External Relations Council, Ireland and its EU colleagues adopted revised Council conclusions on Indonesia. The conclusions reaffirmed the importance we attach to the promotion and protection of human rights in Indonesia. The conclusions stressed the importance of bringing all perpetrators of human rights violations to justice, and emphasised the importance of actively promoting peaceful solutions to the internal conflicts in Indonesia, including that of Papua.</p>
          <p eId="para_1669">My colleague Deputy Kitt, Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development and human rights, recently met Mr. John Rumbiak of the Institute for Human Rights Study and Advocacy. Mr. Rumbiak gave a briefing on the situation in Papua, including recent events in the central highlands. The Minister of State informed Mr. Rumbiak that the Government continues to monitor the situation closely and will continue to encourage the authorities in Indonesia to act with full regard to the human rights and interests of the people of West Papua. As the Deputy will be aware from previous replies, I raised issues of particular concern, including the human rights situation in Papua, with the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Wirajuda, at the EU-Asian Foreign Ministers meeting at Brussels in January 2003. I hope to have a further opportunity to do so when I meet the Minister at the ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting which he will host in July. Ireland and its EU partners will continue to support the development of a strengthened dialogue and partnership between the EU and Indonesia. The Government sees this as the most effective way of addressing its serious concerns about the human rights situation in Papua.</p>

      <b>Mr. Boyle</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
      the way in which his Department will respond subsequent to a recent public meeting held in Cork, to a call on the Government to ensure that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is given priority on its foreign affairs agenda, to use its significant influence with the Governments of Uganda and Rwanda, and other African countries, to insist that they engage positively with negotiations and efforts to resolve the ongoing conflict in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to ensure that this country remains on the international agenda, particularly through the Presidency of Ireland of the European Union in 2004.

          <p eId="para_1671">I conveyed the deep concern of the Government about the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on a number of occasions recently. I assure the Deputy that a lasting resolution to the conflict in that country will continue to be an important aim of the Government, particularly during Ireland's Presidency of the EU next year. The situation in Bunia has stabilised following the start of the EU-led Operation Artemis, to which Ireland will contribute four Army officers based at operational and force headquarters. I welcome the news that agreement has been reached in Kinshasa on an interim Government to lead the country into elections. I am extremely concerned, however, at the movement of rebel troops in the north Kivu area in the east of the country, particularly as it has the potential to further destabilise the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1672">Ireland has always sought to highlight the grave problems in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at international fora. During our membership of the UN Security Council, we took part in Security Council missions to the Great Lakes region in 2001 and to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2002. We were strong advocates of the inter-Congolese dialogue, to which we contributed €127,000. We have used bilateral meetings with southern African countries to discuss ways in which regional and international pressure can be used to push for peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As a development partner, we have conveyed to the Ugandan Government on a number of occasions our concern at its involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and our view that full implementation of the Lusaka Agreement by all parties is the most viable solution to the conflict. We have also made our views known to the Governments of Rwanda and other African countries that have been involved in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_235">The EU has also been active on the issue of peace in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last week, the Presidency issued a strong declaration on the situation in the east of the country. It called on the rebel RCD group to desist from troop movements in the north Kivu area and asked the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda and Rwanda to refrain from any action which may destabilise the peace process. The EU has recently demarched the Governments of the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, Uganda and Rwanda about the situation in the Ituri region, expressing its grave concern at human rights violations being perpetrated by armed groups there and calling on them to use their influence with the armed groups to reduce tensions in the area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">The situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is an ongoing item on the agenda of the UN Security Council and will continue to be for some time to come. During its Presidency of the EU in 2004 and in the lead up to it, Ireland will be active in ensuring that the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains high up on the EU agenda.</summary>

No members of these boards have their correspondence address in Roscommon. In selecting persons to act on boards, appointments are not made on the basis of geographical location.

          <p eId="para_1676">The J1 visa programme is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and the Government has no involvement in the operation of the programme. However, as part of my Department's consular role to assist Irish citizens abroad, our embassy and consulates general in the US monitor the situation of Irish J1 visa holders closely and raise their concerns with  the US authorities as necessary. I am aware that a number of J1 visitors arriving in the US this year have experienced difficulties in obtaining social security numbers. I understand that these problems are not unique to Irish citizens or to this category of visa and are being experienced by visa holders from other countries also. They arise from new procedures introduced by the US social security administration last year as part of a general tightening of the regulations that apply to immigrants in the US following the events of 11 September 2001. Confirmation of an applicant's immigration status needs to be obtained from the Department of Homeland Security before a social security number can be issued. This has led to delays in the issuing of social security numbers to J1 visa holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1677">The consulate general in Boston has been in contact with a number of Irish J1 visa holders in the Boston area who have been experiencing delays in receiving social security numbers. It has been working actively to help them overcome these problems. The consulate has spoken to the regional social security administration office and the Department of Homeland Security in Boston as well as to employers of Irish J1 visa holders. The embassy in Washington, on my instructions, has also taken up this matter with the US State Department. In response to the consulate's representations, the Department of Homeland Security has stated that it will devote additional staff resources to processing requests for confirmation of immigration status from the social security services and I am hopeful that this will help to overcome the current problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1678">The US authorities have indicated that J1 visa holders do not require a social security number to begin work but that they must have applied for a social security number and obtained a letter from the relevant office to that effect before they can be paid. It is possible for employers to employ J1 visa holders pending receipt of the number but it appears that many employers are not aware of this. They are reluctant to take on employees who do not have a valid social security number in the current economic and security climate. The consulate general in Boston will continue to do everything possible to expedite the issue of social security numbers to Irish J1 visa holders and to ensure that employers are fully aware of the regulations. If an Irish J1 visa holder encounters financial difficulties as a result of delays in receiving their social security number, the consulate can help to arrange for the transfer of funds from family or friends in Ireland. The consulate does not, however, have any funds available to provide direct support to Irish citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_1680">The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes – Vote 38 (Department of Foreign Affairs) and Vote 39 (International Co-operation). Details of the funding allocated by my Department for the provision of payments, facilities or services for those with physical or intellectual disabilities in 2003 are set out below.</p>
          <p eId="para_1681">Under Vote 38, the Communicating Europe Initiative, which is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, will allocate approximately €10,000 from subhead D to the Disability Federation of Ireland. The federation is holding a series of information workshops around Ireland to promote discussion about the European Union and Ireland's role in it and to provide practical information about how the Union works for its citizens. This project will continue until the end of July 2003. The Communicating Europe initiative also provided funding amounting to €9,845 in late 2002 for an ongoing information service on the National Disability Authority which will continue throughout 2003. In addition to providing information about the EU on disability-related issues, the NDA holds regular online question and answer sessions for site users with specific queries about the Union. The Deputy may also wish to note that the provision of services and facilities for those with disabilities is given priority in my Department's current building and refurbishment programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1682">Under subhead G of Vote 39, which relates to eastern Europe, €18,881 was allocated in 2003 to the Bulgarian Association for People with Intellectual Disabilities for the equipping of a centre in Bulgaria for the rehabilitation of people with intellectual disabilities. Later this year, the second payment of €217,336 from a total approved grant of €457,336, €240,000 of which was paid in 2002, will be made to a personal assistance service programme in Serbia. The objective of this programme is to support independent living and full civic participation of disabled people and their associations in Serbia. This relates to subhead B, the Balkans stability pact.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_237">Under the NGO co-financing scheme, Ireland Aid supports specific projects and programmes for people in the developing world with disabilities through a variety of funding schemes and mechanisms, including the multi-annual programme scheme, the annual block grants and project co-financing. For a variety of reasons, it is difficult to identify precisely how much Ireland Aid funding in 2003 is specifically targeted at people with disabilities. It is not possible, in many cases, to differentiate between the beneficiaries of certain programmes which may address education, health or water and sanitation needs in  communities with high incidences of river blindness or landmine injury. However, funding in the region of approximately €500,000 was allocated for projects addressing the specific needs of disabled communities in 2002 under the NGO co-financing scheme alone. Further significant amounts were allocated through block grants. GOAL's programme, for example, included a number of projects targeting vulnerable persons with disabilities. Among some specific examples of clearly identifiable projects and programmes specifically targeting disabled groups which have received Ireland Aid support is an amount of €88,000 allocated in late June for the development of a school for the deaf in Nigeria.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_238">Ireland Aid's humanitarian assistance is targeted at victims of natural or man-made disasters in the poorer countries of the world. Those with physical or intellectual disabilities are often among the most vulnerable groups receiving such assistance. Under the Ireland Aid partnership agreement with the International Labour Organisation, funding has been specifically allocated for an ILO programme aimed at capacity building for female entrepreneurs with disabilities in developing countries. Funding for this initiative, which is primarily focused on east Africa, has amounted to $674,000 from subhead B of the  Ireland Aid Vote. The Government also supports a second programme with the ILO to provide advice and advocacy for the employment of people with disabilities in developing countries. Funding of $485,000 has been provided for this from subhead B. The timeframe for both programmes is from 2002 to 2005.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_239">To date in 2003, Ireland Aid has delivered almost €1.2 million for landmine action in the developing world. As part of this assistance, €195,000 has been provided to Handicap International, a non-governmental organisation, which assists victims of mines and explosive remnants of war, to rebuild their lives. In 2003, Ireland Aid contributed €250,000 to the OHCHR to support its work in relation to a thematic cluster that includes disability as well as gender and HIV/AIDS. This contribution was part of our 2003 voluntary contribution to the OHCHR which comes under subhead E of Vote 39. Ireland Aid is funding a United Nations development programme project under the human rights and democratisation scheme in China to enhance the human rights of persons with disabilities. The project is being funded over two years, 2002-03, to a total of €115,000, subhead B.</summary>

This project is currently at stage 1 – site suitability, briefing and site report – and is included in section 7 of the published 2003 building programme. Given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, my Department does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to allow architectural planning for further large-scale projects to progress beyond their current authorised stage.

          <p eId="para_1750">In January 2003 my Department advised all primary schools that responses to applications for special educational needs support for the final term of the 2002-03 school year would be issued in the week commencing 7 April 2003. All applications made by schools up to and including 14 February 2003 were to be considered in that context. A further communication to schools in March 2003 included a request for professional documentation in support of the applications to be submitted to the national educational psychological service. Schools were reminded that any delay in submitting this documentation to NEPS might result in a delay in reaching a decision regarding the allocation of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1751">During the week commencing 7 April 2003, my Department wrote to all schools which had applied for SEN supports by the previous 14 February. Schools which had made a full and complete application were given a definitive response and the remainder of the applicant schools were advised as to the general reasons it was not possible to issue a decision within the timeframe in their cases. The main reasons for the delays were that professional reports were not submitted by schools to NEPS as requested; reports were sent to wrong addresses, resulting in delays; and certain schools omitted any reference to roll number or county on envelopes or contents, as requested. Schools which had failed to submit the professional documentation to NEPS were requested to do so by 16 April 2003. My Department is now finalising its examination of this batch of applications for SEN supports and responses will issue to schools shortly, including the school referred to by the Deputy.</p>

The NCTE on behalf of my Department continues to support the project by providing training and advice to the schools and teachers involved in the project.

          <p eId="para_1759">Under the terms of the indemnity agreement between the State and CORI, signed on the 5 June 2002, there is provision for CORI to make a contribution of €128 million as follows: cash payment, €41.14 million; property, €76.86 million; counselling, €10.00 million. The cash sum of €41.14 million has been received in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_1760">Under the property aspect of the indemnity agreement two schedules of property have been submitted by CORI. The first schedule represents property to the value of €36.54 million that the religious congregations are offering to the State. Initially the State party had a period of nine months to consider these offers. An extension of a further two months was requested in order to consider the properties on offer further. Following further examination of the properties on offer, officials at my Department outlined a number of properties which the State was prepared to accept a fee simple interest in. A number of other properties were rejected on the basis that no benefit to the State could be identified by acquiring a title.</p>
          <p eId="para_1761">Section 8 of the agreement states that in the event that the State party rejects a property offered, the religious congregation has the right to replace the property with an alternative property or cash sum equivalent. CORI has submitted a schedule of alternative properties which the congregations propose to offer the State in place of the properties the State has declined. The nine month period for consideration of these properties commenced on the receipt of this list by my Department. The second schedule represents properties to the value of €40.32 million that the religious congregations maintain were transferred to the State since the date of the Taoiseach's apology on the 11 May 1999. To date the State party has not agreed that any properties on this schedule qualify under the terms of the indemnity. Officials at my Department have sought additional information in relation to these properties from CORI.</p>

          <p eId="para_1763">Section 7(iv) of the indemnity agreement provides for €10 million to be spent on counselling and other support services to be delivered by the religious congregations. The nationwide counselling service is provided through an organisation called Faoiseamh, which was established in 1997 to assist victims of abuse. This organisation operates a freephone service and facilitates victims of abuse and their families with one to one counselling with lay counsellors. The congregations are accountable to my Department for the operation of this fund. An initial report has been provided to my Department on the running of this service and further clarification has been sought on the exact breakdown of the service provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1764">Section 7(i) provides for a sum of €12.7 million to be used by the State party for educational programmes for former residents of institutions and their families. My Department decided to administer this fund through the national offices for victims of abuse, NOVA. An ad hoc committee was established to draft an application form and criteria for eligibility in order to facilitate former residents and their families in accessing this fund to pursue educational courses. The committee is comprised of a representative from the further education section of my Department, two representatives from the City of Dublin VEC and one member from each of the four victim support groups affiliated to NOVA. The grant scheme should be in operation for the forthcoming academic year, which begins in September 2003. I am not aware of the State having provided for the acquisition or leasing of any property for this purpose.</p>

In 2000, as part of my Department's reading initiative, learning support guidelines were provided to all schools and were aimed at ensuring that all children achieve appropriate levels of literacy and numeracy during the course of their primary education. The learning support guidelines recommend high levels of co-operation between class teachers, learning support teachers and parents in supporting children who are experiencing learning difficulties. In selecting pupils for remedial education, priority should be given to those pupils who achieve scores at or below the 10th percentile. In order to allow for measurement error, consideration may be given to selecting pupils who achieve scores up to and including the 12th percentile. Once schools are satisfied that the needs of pupils who have very low achievement or serious learning difficulties have been met, a limited degree of flexibility may be exercised in the deployment of the learning support teacher.</p>

I assure the Deputy that the needs of the school will be taken fully into account in the event of additional learning support teacher posts becoming available for distribution.</summary>

In view of the commercial sensitivity of the site acquisition process, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to comment further on this matter at this time other than to state that it is not expected that the site will be available for the forthcoming school year.

My Department is also arranging for the installation of a prefabricated unit at Archbishop Ryan national school. The unit will be installed over the summer and will be available for September. A new school, Griffeen Valley Educate Together national school, was established in the Lucan area in September 2002. The school's accommodation in the scout den in Lucan village is insufficient to meet its needs for September 2003. In this regard, my officials are in communication with the school authorities with a view to having alternative accommodation in place for September 2003. Primary provision in the Lucan area, and in south Lucan in particular, will continue to be monitored by my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1804">Pupils and parents enjoy a number of legal rights regarding their choice of school for primary education. These derive from the Constitution, legislation and my Department's rules. Statutory rights to choice of school derives from the Education Act 1998, section 6 of which provides for a number of objects to which those concerned with the implementation of the Act must have regard, including promoting, "the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources".</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_246">I am aware, however, that a number of issues relating to religious education are of real concern to parents. The focus on this issue has resulted from the increasingly multi-cultural nature of the schoolgoing population; the growing diversity of beliefs, values and lifestyles in Irish society; the desire of parents to arrange for their children's education in a school with a religious ethos that coincides with their own religious beliefs; the growing numbers of children attending denominational schools who are of differing faiths or of none; and the demand for increased choice.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_247">Consideration of this concern must take account of recent legislation and curriculum changes which have acknowledged the rights of the individual with regard to values and beliefs and made provision for the wide range that now exists in Irish society. Under section 30 of the Education Act 1998, no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student. The Act also requires that, in prescribing curricula for recognised schools, the Minister must take due account of the characteristic spirit of a school or type of school. Section 15 of the Act requires boards of management of schools to uphold and be accountable to the patron for upholding the characteristic spirit of the school including the moral, religious, social, educational and spiritual values which inform the ethos of the school.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_248">At primary level, my Department recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation. This right is enshrined in the Education Act 1998. Consequently, although religious education is part of the curriculum for primary schools and schools are obliged to allocate 30 minutes per day for religious instruction, the content of the religion programme is determined by the patron of the school.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_249">The revised curriculum for primary schools espouses the importance of tolerance towards the practice, culture and lifestyle of a range of religious convictions and states explicitly that the beliefs and sensibilities of every child are to be respected. Legislation has been enacted and the new curriculum is being implemented and primary school authorities are taking their responsibilities in this regard very seriously. This should alleviate some of the concerns of parents. My Department has established the new schools advisory committee, the task of which is to scrutinise applications for new schools and to advise on future provision. Part of its remit is to ensure diversity of provision and, clearly, the issues outlined above are central to its work.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_250">At second level, a new syllabus for religious education was introduced on a phased basis in September 2000. This syllabus is concerned with understanding religion as a phenomenon in the world and is designed to be studied by students of all religious faiths and of none. It has been examined for the first time in the jun ior certificate examination this year. For the students taking this course a syllabus for religious education at leaving certificate, higher and ordinary levels, will be introduced this September for examination in 2005. Within three years, religious education will be an available option to all post-primary schools as an examination subject.</summary>

The school authorities have been advised accordingly.</p>

      the reason a person (details supplied) is being refused resource help despite recommendations of a NEP psychologist stating that, although he does not meet the criteria for resource, this person will continue to make progress at literacy only within the context of pursuing an intensive structured graded cumulative and multi-sensory based approached and that they will not require literacy skills via the ordinary modalities of instruction which would suit most children.

          <p eId="para_1887">The person concerned was not assessed by a NEPS psychologist but by a  private practitioner who conducted the assessment under the terms of the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments. The application for additional resources for the person was made in respect of specific learning disability or dyslexia. Pupils with this type of disability are most effectively helped through the learning support programme in their schools. In a small number of cases, pupils whose assessment results indicate that they have severe dyslexia may be eligible for additional resource hours. The criteria for this additional resource are very stringent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1888">In this particular case, the psychologist who carried out the assessment stated in her report that the pupil did not meet the criteria for a specific learning disability as determined by the Department. She provided helpful, detailed recommendations for the content of the remedial programme that should be provided for the pupil. This programme is of the kind that is normally undertaken by learning support teachers and my Department has therefore concluded that learning support is the appropriate intervention in this case.</p>

          <p eId="para_1984">For the purposes of my Department's maintenance grants schemes reckonable income means all amounts – with the exception of defined social welfare and health board payments – received or receivable by an individual without reference to his or her residence or domicile, from both Irish and foreign sources, which are liable to Irish income tax, Irish capital gains tax or Irish capital acquisitions tax, or which would be so liable but for exemptions and reliefs contained in Irish legislation. The intent of this definition is to ensure that all types of income will be included in determining a person's income for grant purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1985">For the purposes of determining grant eligibility, all investments must be declared, including deposit accounts, savings certificates, life assurance bonds and other financial instruments where the interest-profit is accumulated and paid out as a lump sum at the end of the investment period.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_254">Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income. Where income is not paid out annually but is rolled-up and paid out with the original invest ment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the rolled-up income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment. This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_255">Given its similarity with roll-up savings products it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs on an annual basis. The treatment of the SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as post office savings certificates.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_256">The amount of income to be included in respect of SSIAs is the Government grant earned on the savings in the relevant tax year plus, in the case of savings accounts, the gross interest earned in the relevant tax year and, in the case of investment accounts, the investment profit earned in the relevant tax year. Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible. Reckonable income will not include any element of the person's own contributions to the account.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_2014">The Government is committed to continuing to build on the unprecedented development of special education services, which has taken place in recent years. Our commitment is reflected in the following breakdown of current service levels. Learning support teachers address the literacy and numeracy needs of pupils. These would be children scoring below the tenth percentile in norm referenced standardised tests. The number of learning support teachers in the primary school system has increased from 1,302 in  1998 to 1,531 at present. The annual salary cost of these teachers is approximately €54 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2015">Resource teachers operate in the ordinary classrooms. They are dedicated to addressing the needs of children who have been assessed as having specific learning difficulties arising from a disability. The number of resource teachers has increased from 104 in 1998 to more than 2,300 at present. The annual salary cost of these teachers is estimated at over €70 million. The allocation for part-time tuition services for children with special needs has been increased from €12 million in 2002 to €19 million in 2003. This includes expenditure for part time resource teachers and the home tuition scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2016">Special needs assistants are appointed to support children with disabilities who have been assessed as requiring this support in order to participate in the education system. The number of special needs assistants has grown from 300 in 1998 to 4,000 full-time and a further 1,200 part-time posts. The annual salary cost of this service is estimated at €100 million for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2017">Children attending special classes attached to mainstream schools, in common with children attending special schools, are entitled to avail of the special school transport service. Provision is also made for the appointment of escorts on all special school transport services. Approximately €30 million was expended on special school transport in 2002 and a further €4.4 million on the escort service. Data is not readily available for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2018">Funding towards special equipment for children with disabilities has increased from €635,000 in 1998 to €3.26 million in 2003. Equipment such as braillers, touch-talkers and computers is grant-aided. The equipment assists these children in deriving maximum benefit from the education system. There are approximately 500 special classes attached to mainstream primary schools. These classes cater for an estimated 4,000 pupils. Each special class caters for children in a particular disability category. Each class operates at a reduced pupil teacher ratio, PTR, and children attending such classes attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. For example, the PTR for children with a mild general learning disability is 11:1. There are 108 special schools catering for approximately 6,000 pupils. Like the special classes attached to mainstream schools, the special schools operate at reduced PTRs and the pupils attract the special rates of capitation funding. These schools employ an estimated 1,090 teachers at an annual salary cost of €43.6 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2019">These figures represent real and substantial improvements in special education services and provide concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of these services.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2023">In late 1998 the Government commissioned a high level advisory committee on telecommunications to analyse Ireland's suitability to become an e-commerce hub of Europe. The committee identified a number of potential impediments to achieving this objective. One of the more significant challenges as identified by the group was the lack of high capacity international bandwidth to and from Ireland at internationally competitive prices. To rectify this, the then Department of Public Enterprise and IDA Ireland issued a call in early 1999 inviting providers of international bandwidth to make submissions on the provision of international connectivity into and out of Ireland. The project aimed at ensuring availability of state-of-the-art competitively priced international telecoms connectivity to facilitate the development of Ireland as a significant centre for e-business. A number of large international cable operators submitted bids which were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team hired by the Department of Public Enterprise. A contract was signed on the 2 July 1999 with Global Crossing to provide Ireland with 25 year indefeasible rights of use for 160 STMs of competitively priced managed bandwidth connectivity to New York and 26 European cities for a cost of €94 million payable over two and a half years. To deliver this bandwidth, the  company constructed two new build submarine cables to link Ireland to its transatlantic and pan-European global communications networks and brings the capacity from the landing stations to two points of interconnection to the global network in Dublin over two geographically diverse routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2024">Under new extensions to that agreement, my Department has secured links to 40 European centres and to additional cities in the USA and Asia. These extensions were secured at no additional cost to the original contract. In addition, to maintain the competitiveness of existing routes significant reductions in the annual operating charges on all routes have also been negotiated. A process to resell this contracted capacity to telecoms operators in Ireland was initiated, with the intention of recouping the investment and ensuring that the benefits were passed on to the Irish market. All licensed telecommunications operators in Ireland were invited to acquire capacity. The Government reserved the right to retain a certain amount of this capacity for strategic research purposes and bandwidth was transferred to HEAnet to upgrade its communications network and facilitate its research programme. Initially, the resale process was oversubscribed. With the downturn in the telecoms and related markets, interest waned. A number of companies have ceased to trade and have been unable to honour their contracts-bids to purchase capacity. To date, contracts are in place for 80 of these STMs and a total of €29.8 million has been collected. IDA is currently preparing to proceed with legal action to recover the remaining debt of €12.9 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2025">Since signing the contract demand for bandwidth has shifted towards wavelength and IP products. Through negotiations, my Department has ensured that the Government's bandwidth is now available as IP and wavelengths. With the economic downturn companies are also less willing to enter long-term contracts for managed bandwidth so my Department has negotiated that bandwidth products may now be made available on a lease basis. The market value of the bandwidth is currently being established by experts recruited by IDA Ireland. My Department has also recruited a sales agent to assist in selling and leasing the remaining bandwidth.</p>

          <p eId="para_2052">I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 262 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2053">The provision of health centres to meet the needs of local communities and the maintenance and upgrading of such centres within its functional area is a matter for the relevant health board or the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of Millbrook Lawns health centre, Tallaght, Dublin 24, this responsibility rests with the ERHA. I have been in contact with the ERHA and it has informed me that Millbrook Lawns health centre currently provides a comprehensive range of services including public health nursing, development clinics, dental, speech and language therapy, community welfare, home help, social work and addiction services. Pre-school services are also provided from this centre.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_266">A number of improvements have been made to the health centre since 1999, including the internal and external painting of the premises. Additional offices have been provided for use by community welfare and Barnados. The fire alarm system has been upgraded and the ceiling has been substantially improved. The speech and language therapy service has been relocated to a different area within the centre. Essential health and safety improvements have been made in the last year. Improvements to the electrical system have also been carried out. In fact, a health and safety audit, conducted last November noted significant improvements since the previous inspection and further recommendations from this  recent audit are being actively addressed. It is planned to relocate the addiction services before the end of 2003. The authority has informed me that it will continue to ensure that the conditions in the existing heath centre are maintained to the highest standard possible for the effective delivery of services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_267">The re-development of the centre is a priority capital project for the South West Area Health Board and submissions to obtain the necessary funding have been made to the ERHA. The South West Area Health Board continues to work with the ERHA on this matter. All capital requirements for the health boards, including the ERHA, are funded under the NDP. My Department is at present reviewing, from a national perspective, the NDP for each health board. This process encompasses providing for existing capital contractual commitments and, where possible, the planning or construction of new projects this year and into the future. It is in this context that capital developments for the ERHA are being considered. The Department fully appreciates the importance of progressing such developments and will continue to work closely with the authority in relation to prioritising their overall capital needs in line with the funding resources available under the NDP.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_271">Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately €400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of €29 million which was provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services in such areas as oncology-haematology services, oncology drug treatments and symptomatic breast disease services. Cancer services throughout the country have benefited from this investment which far exceeds the £25 million requirement which was initially envisaged under the national cancer strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 85 additional consultant posts, together with support staff in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2117">As explained in my reply to the Deputy's question No. 157 of 8 May 2003, it was not possible to obtain and collate the details requested by the Deputy in the time allowed. The relevant information has now been received from the boards concerned and is as detailed below.</p>
          <p eId="para_2118">The Mid-Western Health Board's records indicate that 183 people in that region received vaccine from Trivax batch number 3741; of that group, the board was successful in obtaining current addresses for 104 individuals to whom they then wrote advising that they had received vaccine from that batch. Of these, 67 contacted subsequently telephoned the board in order to get further details. Of the 183 recipients, one individual is known to have an intellectual disability and is on the board's intellectual disability database.</p>
          <p eId="para_2119">An extensive trawl of records by the North-Western Health Board has identified three individuals in that region who received vaccine from Trivax batch number 3741. I understand from the board that none of the three individuals involved has a learning disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_2120">The Southern Health Board undertook a comprehensive search of vaccine records which included the following measures: an examination of the electoral register; the board wrote to a number of GPs to request their assistance and sent lists relevant to their area; community welfare officers and public health nurses were consulted regarding the possibility of identifying recipients, and; an examination of board's intellectual disability register. This search identified that 106 people – the figure of 107 which was provided by the SHB for Parliamentary Question No. 181 of 4 July 2001 was subsequently revised – in the Southern Health Board region received vaccine from Trivax batch number 3741. Letters were sent to those for whom the board had current addresses, 37, which asked the individuals concerned to make contact with the relevant senior area medical officer. Of these, 29 subsequently made contact with the board.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_272">In a further 18 cases, the individuals were no longer resident at the home address and the board considered it inappropriate for reasons of confidentiality to make contact with the home. I understand from the board that despite all of the above attempts, it was not possible to contact the remaining individuals. According to the Southern Health Board, none of the 29 individuals contacted had suffered any ill effects from the vaccine. The board has confirmed that none of the 106 individuals are on their intellectual disability register.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_273">The Western Health Board identified three persons who received vaccine from Trivax batch number 3741. The board clarified this by explaining that they were unable to trace any other records as the register represents vaccinations in the Galway area only and in most cases batch or lot numbers were not written in at the time when vaccination was given. The board has stated that none of three individuals concerned are included on their learning disability database.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_274">In conclusion, I am satisfied that the four health boards concerned have completed a thorough search for all relevant records and have done all that is reasonable within their power to contact the individuals concerned.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2124">The setting of premium charges is the responsibility of the VHI board. The legislation requires the board to set premiums at a level sufficient to cover costs and make such allowance for reserves as it thinks proper. The board is, however, obliged to notify the Minister in advance of putting its increases into effect and the Minister may prevent the introduction of an increase. Since 1 July 1997, the following premium increases were implemented by the VHI board in accordance with the statutory provisions and, as requested by  the Deputy, a unit cost of €100 is assumed at that date.</p>

          <p eId="para_2151">Entitlement to health services is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act 1970 determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the  appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_2152">Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations or where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants. The educational maintenance grant is provided in order to assist students in meeting their living expenses. The fact that an applicant is in receipt of such a grant is included by the health boards as one of the factors to be taken into account in determining whether the applicant is independent of his or her parents and whether he or she is therefore, eligible for a medical card, together with other factors which may also be relevant in the case of an individual applicant. The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.</p>
          <p eId="para_2153">It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>

          <p eId="para_2159">As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment. Construction of phase 1 of the new hospital development at James Connolly Memorial Hospital is nearing completion. This major development is being funded jointly by the Northern Area Health Board through the sale of surplus lands and the Department. The projected full project cost is €101.4 million. This includes an amount of €5 million recently approved to facilitate refurbishment works at  the hospital which are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_2160">The development includes a number of facilities which have already been completed. These include an accident and emergency department, an operating department, a surgical day unit as well as in-patient and associated accommodation and medical support services. The new hospital will provide a 56 bed unit comprising 44 acute psychiatric beds, six high observation beds and six psychiatry of later life beds. The existing acute psychiatric unit has 22 beds. Patients from a 22 bed unit at St. Brendan's Hospital will also be moving to the new unit. The new hospital will also provide 12 new day beds and additional capacity in the intensive care and coronary care units. The refurbishment of the existing surgical block is also being progressed at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_2161">The development at the hospital is on schedule both in terms of the timeframe and also in budgetary terms. The next stage of the project will involve commissioning and equipping of the new building. Discussions in relation to the capital and revenue requirements for this process are currently in train, involving the ERHA, the NAHB and my Department.</p>

Firstly, a major capital development at Crumlin, costing €31 million, to provide seven new operating theatres, a day ward and the upgrading of the ICU department is nearing completion. This development is designed to ensure that children on waiting lists for surgery and other procedures can access services within a reasonable period of time.</p>

In 2001, the Department approved €3.8 million for urgent priority equipment and minor works for the hospital. This bulk of this was drawn down by the hospital in 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_2247">The company in question holds licences from my Department for the operation of bus passenger services between Leopardstown and Dublin Airport and between Ballsbridge and Dublin Airport. The licence for the Leopardstown to Dublin Airport service, allows the company to pick up passengers at selected stops between Leopardstown and RTE in Donnybrook with a non – stop operation thereafter to Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_2248">The Ballsbridge to Dublin Airport licence allows the company to pick up passengers at designated stops in the city centre with a non-stop operation thereafter to Dublin Airport. The Department received a complaint that the company, on its Leopardstown to Dublin Airport service was picking up passengers between RTE and Dublin Airport in apparent breach of the licence for this route. The complaint was the subject of on-the-spot monitoring by officers of my Department. The inspections confirmed that the Leopardstown to Dublin Airport service was not operating in full compliance with the licence conditions.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_281">My Department has taken this matter up with the operator concerned. The operator has  pointed out the since these two services converge and follow the same route from Ballsbridge to Dublin Airport, their operation is not as efficient as it could be. The operator has applied to the Department for an amendment to both licences in order to regularise the position. The operator has been requested to comply fully with the conditions of the existing Leopardstown to Dublin Airport licence pending the processing of the applications for amendment.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2255">In the context of the annual block grant for national  roads projects made available to the National Roads Authority through the Estimates this year, I asked the NRA in determining the allocation of funding to individual road schemes in 2003 to give priority to projects on the major inter-urban routes, PPP projects and projects in the BMW region. This request reflected the need to maintain progress on upgrading the key inter-urban routes linking the major urban centres; the importance of getting some of the PPP projects to construction so as to maintain good market interest in the PPP programme given the significant level of private sector funding which the programme will bring to the national roads programme, and the need to restore more balance in the investment in national roads as between the southern and eastern and BMW regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2256">These priorities are in line with the strategic framework set by Government in the NDP for the development of the national roads network. It is a matter for the NRA, within this framework, to allocate funding to individual projects having regard to the funding available. It is important to note that the priorities set for the 2003 allocations do not require the NRA to allocate all the funding available to these priorities nor do they preclude the NRA from funding other priority projects across the national road network.</p>

          <p eId="para_2262">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 295 and 298 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2263">Dublin Airport is our largest airport and primary international gateway accounting for 15 million passengers last year or 76% of total air passengers in 2002. Traffic at Dublin Airport is expected to double to 30 million passengers by 2020 and one of the key objectives of our aviation policy is to ensure that our principal gateway airports, including Dublin Airport, are in a position to provide cost competitive and appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of airlines and other aviation companies, consistent with a commercial mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_2264">One of the main issues in the programme for Government is the commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin Airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits. I sought expressions of interest from the market for this last autumn and received 13 responses from a range of national and international companies and consortia. The panel of experts which considered those expressions of interest concluded in its report of February this year that such a terminal is both operationally and technically feasible. The panel also believes that an independent terminal is a viable strategic option for the development of Dublin Airport and would elicit considerable market interest. As pointed out in the panel's report legislative changes would be required to allow the development of an independent terminal at Dublin Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_2265">I am continuing to give urgent attention to the independent terminal concept and it would be my intention to discuss the matter again with Government in the near future.</p>

          <p eId="para_2452">I visited Madrid in March last to see and hear, at first hand, the approach that the authorities there are taking to the construction of their transport infrastructure. The Madrid authorities are undertaking a significant investment programme involving roads, metro and a second terminal at Barajas Airport. Reports to me suggested that the cost effectiveness of these projects and timescale in which they are being delivered were worthy of examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_2453">In addition to having very interesting and fruitful discussions with my counterpart from the Spanish Government, I also met with public and private bodies, including representatives of the State, regional and local authorities. I was impressed with the short delivery time that has been achieved in Madrid for major infrastructure projects and with the comparatively low outturn costs that were quoted to me.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_299">Following on my visit, a delegation from my Department and the RPA made a visit to Madrid to establish in detail, the differences in costs, timescales and the decision making and regulatory environment between the Madrid and Dublin metro projects. While there are significant differences in the cost of labour and materials, other factors such as 24 hour tunnelling, single bore tunnelling such as used throughout Spain and France and simplified station design have the potential to reduce costs and timescales in this country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_300">Subsequently, Professor Manuel Melis Maynar was invited to visit Dublin and imparted his experience as chairman of Metro de Madrid to me, to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure and to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. As a result of these exchanges, the RPA metro proposals are being reappraised to identify the scope for reducing the cost and delivery time for the metro project. In this connection, I will be bringing proposals to Government shortly.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2455">Under the Transport (Rail Infrastructure) Act 2001 the Railway Procurement Agency has a statutory obligation to secure the provision of such light railway and metro railway infrastructure as I may from time to time determine.</p>
          <p eId="para_2456">I have confidence in the ability of the RPA to procure the proposed Dublin metro on a cost-effective basis. A competitive procurement process will determine the eventual cost of the metro to the Exchequer as distinct from estimated costs at this early stage of the process. The level and quality of the international interest in the competition for the metro project, as proven by the 18 companies which have pre-qualified for the competition also supports my view on this matter as potential bidders would not engage in the lengthy and expensive process without having confidence in the RPA.</p>
          <p eId="para_2457">Furthermore, during his recent visit, Professor Melis Maynar, the President of Metro de Madrid, which has been responsible for the delivery of over 100 kilometres of new metro in Madrid in the past eight years has commented very favourably on the quality and ability of the Irish engineers involved in this and other projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_2458">My Department is currently finalising its evaluation of the RPAs recommendations on how the PPP procurement of the first metro line should proceed and I will be bringing proposals to the Government shortly.</p>

Connex Ireland has no direct connection with Connex Transport UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_2461">The contract to operate the Luas was signed in May 2002 between the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and the rail operator, Connex. The services operated by Connex in the UK are not comparable with the situation regarding Luas. Connex's UK operation was based on heavy rail infrastructure while the Luas light rail infrastructure and rolling stock is new and of the highest quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_2462">Connex was selected following an EU competitive tendering process. The contract is for five years from commencement of operations. Prior to awarding this contract, the RPA reviewed Connex's performance on light rail systems worldwide. While it is not appropriate for me to comment on a commercial contract between two bodies, I understand that the operations contract for Luas includes rigorous performance targets for reliability, availability and service quality. Connex Ireland will face financial penalties if it does not meet the targets set out in the contract. The RPA will monitor Connex's performance during the contract period.</p>
          <p eId="para_2463">Connex Ireland is already mobilising operations in Dublin, in preparation for the commencement of passenger services in June 2004. The RPA is confident in Connex's ability to operate Luas to meet the highest standards of performance for the commuters of Dublin.</p>

          <p eId="para_2471">Under the national development plan there is a pro vision of €13 million to part-finance public transport accessibility projects. Of this allocation €3.8 million was spent on accessibility projects in 2001and a further €2.15 million was spent in 2002. This expenditure related to the construction of footbridges and the installation of lifts for the mobility impaired at railway stations, upgrading bus stations to improve access for mobility impaired people and disability awareness training for staff in the CIE operating companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_2472">A sum of €5 million has been allocated for similar accessibility projects to be carried out in 2003 under subhead C2. Subhead C5 expenditure provides funding for investment in public transport under the NDP for Dublin and the regions. Funding for the implementation of the five-year railway safety programme, which was approved by the Government in March 1999, is also funded from subhead C5. The allocation for Subhead C5 for 2003 is €261.37 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_2473">It is my policy that all bus and rail public transport operators, and in particular the State-owned transport companies, should provide the highest possible degree of accessibility within the overall resources available to them. All buses purchased by both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann since 2000 for use on urban services are low floor and wheelchair accessible. Bus Átha Cliath currently has 367 low-floor buses operating in Dublin city representing almost 35% of the fleet. A total of 35 bus routes now have fully accessible services. The entire Bus Éireann urban bus fleet in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford is fully accessible and in addition 20 low-floor buses are operating on rural services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2474">Iarnród Éireanns DART and Arrow suburban rail services are wheelchair accessible over most of the network. The Enterprise service on the Dublin-Belfast line and all inter-city rail services using the more modern rolling stock are also accessible. The new rolling stock funded under the NDP is designed to meet the most up-to-date accessibility standards and has already begun to enter into service. All new major infrastructural projects and upgrades of stations or other facilities, funded by the NDP, are designed to meet the requirements of the mobility impaired.</p>

          <p eId="para_2481">A key performance indicator in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 is to increase the volume of opiates and all other drugs seized by 25% by end of 2004 and by 50% by end of 2008, using 2000 seizures as a base. This indicator reflects a major supply reduction objective of the strategy which is to reduce significantly the volume of illicit drugs available in Ireland, to arrest the dynamic of the existing markets and to curtail new markets as they are identified.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_301">The Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise service are achieving considerable success in this objective and they are to be congratulated  for their continued efforts. The street value of all drugs seized since 2000 has increased each year. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the street value of drugs seized in 2002 was approximately €49 million compared to €45 million in 2001. The 2001 figure was an increase on 2000 when the estimated value of drugs seized by the Garda Síochána was approximately €20 million. Provisional figures for 2003 to date, indicate that the street value of significant drug seizures is over €67 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_302">In regard to heroin and cocaine, the number of offences and the quantities seized in 2000, 2001 and 2002 is set out in this table:</summary>

All policies and programmes funded under the national development plan are required to be gender mainstreamed. Gender mainstreaming is a process whereby a gender equality perspective is incorporated into the development, implementation and evaluation of policies. The NDP gender equality unit of my Department has been set up to provide support and advice to policy makers and implementors on gender mainstreaming. The unit comprises a head of unit, gender equality expert, statistician and two administrative support staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_2531">The principal work of the unit includes providing advice, training and information on issues relating to gender mainstreaming. To date, the unit has delivered 22 training courses to Departments and implementing agencies, furnishing a total of 827 participants with the necessary skills and knowledge to meet their gender mainstreaming requirements under the NDP. The unit also collects and analyses data, engages in research, and advises on the gender impact assessment of policy proposals and the development of appropriate indicators to support gender mainstreaming in the NDP. The unit also provides inputs to the equal opportunities and social inclusion co-ordinating committee and to the mid-term review of the NDP. Finally, the unit supports participation by community and voluntary groups in the gender mainstreaming process.</p>

The bulk of this funding was paid to Roscommon CDB, which organised the work and received €45,202.68, while Donegal CDB received €1,024.30 to launch the gender proofing handbook. The unit has also funded the following three research projects: women in politics and decision making.

          <p eId="para_2577">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the origin of this investigation was a report to the gardaí in March 1997 of the alleged sexual abuse of Child "A". In April 1997 another Garda station received a separate report in relation to Child "B". Both of these children attended the same school for children with special needs. The gardaí, in conjunction with the health board, began an investigation into the allegations. At the conclusion of the investigation 14 children had made allegations.</p>
          <p eId="para_2578">Two people were arrested and questioned in June 1997 about the allegations. Both suspects were re-arrested and questioned in June 1998. I am informed that gardaí and health board officials conducted a comprehensive investigation lasting two years, which included the interviewing, validation and assessment of the children involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_2579">The completed investigation file was forwarded to the DPP who directed that a charge be brought against the person in question in respect of two of the 14 complaints. The presiding judge held a preliminary examination during which the children were interviewed by the judge and the legal teams via video link. Having considered the case, the presiding judge sent the case forward for trial. The case came to trial in Dublin Circuit Court in 2002 and lasted for almost a month. Following deliberation, the jury found the accused not guilty. I am informed that at no stage during the trial did the judge criticise or mention unfavourably the actions of the gardaí. In these circumstances I have no evidence available to me that would warrant holding an independent inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_2580">The fact that a person is acquitted after trial is of itself no basis for concluding that an investigation of an alleged offence ought not to have occurred and-or that there should have been no prosecution and-or that the investigation or prosecution was mishandled. If the Deputy has some other factual material basis for alleging misconduct or advocating any form of inquiry she should draw that to the attention of the appropriate person.</p>

          <p eId="para_2587">I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the day to day allocation of resources, that the personnel strength of Coolock Garda station as at 1 July 2003 is 84, all ranks. Local Garda management is satisfied that it is incorrect to state that there are only two gardaí available for ordinary duties each nightshift in the Coolock area and that resources at Coolock Garda station are adequate to perform all duties, including nightshifts.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_318">Resources are augmented from within the district-division as required. The area is also patrolled by the district detective unit, community policing unit, district drugs unit, divisional crime task force and the divisional traffic unit. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in Coolock Garda station with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. I am assured that the situation will be kept under  review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Coolock Garda Station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2591">For security reasons, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with a breakdown of staffing levels in each prison institution. I can, however, confirm that there is currently a total of 16 prisons and places of detention administered by the Irish Prison Service. These institutions are: Mountjoy Prison, the Dochas Centre – Mountjoy Female Prison, St. Patrick's Institution, the Training Unit Place of Detention, the Curragh Place of Detention, Castlerea Prison, Arbour Hill Prison, Wheatfield Prison, Cloverhill Prison, Cork Prison, Fort Mitchel Place of Detention, Shelton Abbey Place of Detention, Limerick Prison, Portlaoise Prison, Loughan House Place of Detention and the Midlands Prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_2592">The total number of staff serving in all 16 institutions is currently 3,243.5. The authorised staffing complement for these institutions is 3,243. The excess of staff serving over the authorised complement for the institutions overall reflect the recent closure of Shanganagh Castle, with the subsequent reduction of the authorised staffing numbers and the transfer of surplus staff from Shanganagh to other institutions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_319">I would also refer the Deputy to my recent reply to Parliamentary Question No. 49 of 19 June last concerning my proposals for the ending of overtime in the prison service and my intentions in terms of negotiations with the Prison Officers' Association. These negotiations are  focused on the operation of the proposed new annual hours system, the detailed attendance and payment arrangements which will need to be put in place and encompass proposals regarding task and staffing levels. In that context, the Prison Officers' Association have been issued with details of the tasks, hours and staffing envisaged for each institution under the proposed new system for their consideration. The Deputy will appreciate that this matter is the subject of ongoing negotiations with staff representatives and accordingly it would not be appropriate for me to go into further detail at this point in time.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2690">The exposure of workers in Ireland to radon gas in the workplace is subject to regulatory control set out in the Radiological Protection Act 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000. This order implements in  Ireland the 1996 EU Basic Safety Standards Directive laying down standards for the protection of workers and the general public from exposure to ionising radiation. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is responsible for the enforcement of this order in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_2691">The above mentioned order specifies a concentration for radon gas in workplaces of 400 becquerels per cubic metre – Bq/m3 – averaged over a minimum period of three months. Where workplaces are found to have concentrations greater than this value, employers must evaluate whether remedial action to reduce the radon concentration to less than 400 Bq/m3 is justified. Under the order, the institute has the authority to direct employers to carry out radon measurements. Failure to comply with any such direction is an offence and can lead to prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_2692">In 2001, the institute, on foot of the order, initiated a programme to direct employers responsible for aboveground workplaces in high radon areas to measure radon concentration levels. I understand that the institute has issued some 1,800 such directions to employers in Tralee, County Kerry and that, to date, approximately 200 of these employers have carried out radon measurements in their workplaces. Of these 200 workplaces, approximately 30 had radon concentrations greater than the reference level of 400 Bq/m3 specified in the order. These employers have been advised to carry out assessments by the institute to determine if remedial action in respect of their workplaces is justified.</p>

          <p eId="para_2697">In prospect of the formal adoption of the directive, the Government has decided that the EPA will be responsible for implementing the directive in Ireland. The agency is to be designated as the National Allocation Authority to design and implement, by 31 March 2004, a national allocation plan, in accordance with the requirements of the directive, which will determine the amount of greenhouse gas allowances to be allocated to each participating installation. In the development of the plan, the agency will be assisted by a national allocation advisory group, under an independent chairperson, and comprising the chief executives, or senior nominees, of Forfás, Sustainable Energy Ireland, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Commission for Energy Regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2698">The total quantity of allowances to be allocated to the installations engaged in emissions trading in the period 2008-12 must be consistent with achieving our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to limit annual emissions in this period to 13% above 1990 levels. The Government has decided to engage consultants to advise it on the most economically efficient apportionment of the national target between those inside and outside trading, and derived from this, the quantity to be allocated to the trading system in the pilot phase, 2005-07. The allocation for this period must take account of the progressive reductions of emissions required towards achievement of the national Kyoto obligation while also recognising the "learning by doing" nature of the pilot phase.</p>

          <p eId="para_2703">The designation of lands as special areas of conservation – SACs – is not intended as a prohibition on future development. As far as farming activities are concerned, no restrictions on existing activities arise in the majority of cases. In a minority of cases, existing activities may have to be restricted but only to the extent necessary to conserve the habitats and species in the designated areas. Farming prescriptions required to ensure the continuance of the favourable conservation status of SACs are discussed with farming interests and compensation is available for any losses sustained or  income foregone as a result of changing existing practices to comply with these prescriptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2704">Under the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, which transposed the EU habitats directive into Irish law, where a development which requires planning permission is likely to have a significant effect on a SAC, the planning authority must ensure that the implications for the conservation status of the site are assessed. The planning authority may grant permission for the development if the assessment shows that there will be no significant adverse impact on the site. Windfarm proposals are covered by these provisions. Similar provisions apply where operations or activities do not require planning permission but require a licence or consent from any Minister under various enactments.</p>

          <p eId="para_2707">EU Council Directive 98/83/EC on the quality of water intended for human consumption has been substantially transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2000 which will come into operation on 1 January 2004 and which prescribe quality standards for two microbiological and 26 chemical parameters in relation to drinking water supplies. Article 4 of the regulations requires compliance with these quality standards except where a departure has been granted by the EPA under Article 5. A departure cannot be granted in relation to a microbiological parameter or in any case where the departure could cause a potential danger to public health.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_330">The regulations prescribe quality standards for a further 16 "indicator parameters", including aluminium, and require that the necessary remedial action be taken in relation to a water supply which fails to meet the prescribed standard for such a parameter having particular regard to any potential danger to human health. A failure to comply with a quality standard for an indicator parameter does not constitute a contravention of Article 4 of the regulations and the granting of a departure in relation to such a standard does not therefore arise. Aluminium is not  regarded as an essential, health-related parameter. The standard for aluminium of 0.2 milligrams per litre in drinking water provides a compromise between the practical use of aluminium salts in water treatment and discolouration of distributed water. The status of aluminium as an indicator parameter in the directive is based on the World Health Organisation's guidelines for drinking water quality and the opinion of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the European Commission.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_331">In all cases where a sanitary authority considers that a drinking water supply constitutes a potential danger to public health, irrespective of whether or not a prescribed standard has been contravened, the authority is obliged by Article 8 of the regulations to inform and advise consumers and to ensure that the use of the supply is prohibited or restricted, as appropriate, or that such other action as is necessary is taken to protect human health.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2724">The making and amending of rent schemes is the responsibility of local authorities as an integral part of their housing man agement functions, subject to certain broad principles laid down by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_2725">Adherence to these principles, within which authorities have wide discretion as to the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of rents and how to deal with hardship cases, allowances for dependent children, poverty traps and any other anomalies that arise in individual cases, ensures that rents are determined on the basis of tenants' ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_2726">As local authorities have full discretion on the model of rent scheme they implement, variations in schemes can occur. For example some authorities use banded income categories and rent fractions to calculate the differential rent on the principal earner's income while others use a system based on a set percentage, or simple fraction, applied to assessable income. Authorities could also differ in their approach to subsidiary earners, deductions for children, the application of maximum or minimum rents or the use of a hardship clause. Such local discretion and flexibility are inherent in the devolved system of administering rent schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2727">While the rent payable is related to the total income of the household, I can confirm that, as a consequence of specific Government decisions, any increase in income due to participation in the back-to-work allowance scheme or the community employment programme does not attract increased rent.</p>
