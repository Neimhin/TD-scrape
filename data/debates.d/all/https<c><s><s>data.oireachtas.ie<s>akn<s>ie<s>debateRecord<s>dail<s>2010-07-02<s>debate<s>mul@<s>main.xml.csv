I decided some months ago that a new approach was necessary to deal with the problem of head shops which have been emerging in our society in the past year or more.  The Bill before us is such a new approach.  It is a robust, innovative and urgent approach.  In it I am providing that it will be an offence to sell, import or export unregulated psychoactive substances for human consumption.  In addition, and very importantly, I am providing powers for the gardaí and the courts to issue prohibition and closure orders in respect of persons or premises where the sale of such products continues despite notice to cease.in the past year or so, we have seen head shops proliferate in our society.  These shops appeared on the main streets and in the suburbs of our towns and cities.  They sprang up in villages and towns throughout the country.  They all had the same characteristic in common — the sale of a range of unregulated psychoactive substances.  This trade operates behind a veil of technical legality with products marketed as "legal highs".  This gives the impression that they are safe to use.  People, in particular teenagers and young adults, who would not ordinarily take illegal drugs, are thus enticed into purchasing and consuming them.  They also attract the drug-using population who consume these products as alternatives or in addition to controlled drugs such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin.  The products are sold with no information on content and no directions for use.  Needless to say, no standards of quality control or safety are applied.  On the contrary, there is a deliberate attempt at circumventing the legal framework for control of medicinal products by labelling them as "bath salts" or "plant food".There are serious medical concerns that these unregulated products may be as harmful as illegal drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy.  Our already overburdened hospitals are unfortunately seeing the health consequences, with many young people presenting having abused these unregulated products.  A coroner in Kildare recently warned of the dangers of head shop products following the tragic death of a 19 year old woman who had taken two head shop products, mephedrone and butylone, together with prescribed drugs, alcohol and heroin.  I should mention that the two products in question have since been controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts by the Minister for Health and Children.The health and safety concern is very important and it is the main motivating factor for this Bill, but it is not my only concern.  I am seriously concerned that head shops are acting as an unprecedented gateway to illegal drug abuse and criminality, especially for our young people.The House will not be surprised therefore to hear that I put little store by the argument that it is somehow wrong to criminalise the sale of these products because by so doing we increase the market potential for drug traffickers.  These products can be equal to controlled drugs in the threat they present to public health and safety.  I believe that those who trade in them should not be allowed to escape the application of the law.  Nor should they be allowed to avail of any veneer of respectability.  It is a dangerous trade which operates without regard to the consequences for its customers or for society in terms of health and safety, addiction and criminality.This Bill is but one part of the Government's multi-pronged approach targeting the activities of head shops.  The primary vehicles for regulating psychoactive substances are, and will remain, the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977 to 2007.  On foot of the Government order of 11 May, the Minister for Health and Children made the necessary statutory instruments to make the possession and sale of certain substances subject to criminal sanctions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  The regulations covered the mainstream substances commonly being sold in head shops — cannabinoids, BZP derivatives, mephedrone, methylone and related cathinones.I am advised that following the making of these orders, of the 102 head shops then open, many closed but about 36 re-opened shortly afterwards reportedly selling different substances.  The tally of head shops re-opening has since risen and I understand the records of the Garda National Drugs Unit indicate that 48 head shops were trading nationwide on 10 June although this figure had reduced to 44 on 14 June.Given the versatile and changing nature of the trade in psychoactive substances, such fluctuation in numbers operating does not surprise me.  I am not, however, prepared to sit back and resign myself to counting head shops.  On the contrary, this Bill is an indication of my determination to stop this trade in its tracks.  Experience has shown that new psychoactive substances can quickly emerge.  There is now a big international market for these products and skilled chemists in places as far away as China are ready and eager to use their expertise to create new products in response to the lure of large profit associated with this market.  We have seen how quickly products such as "Whack" and "Amplified" have come onto the Irish market following the banning of mephedrone and other such substances by the Minister for Health and Children.  The National Poisons Information Centre has received reports of patients presenting to hospital emergency departments with symptoms of extreme agitation and anxiety having consumed these products.  The Minister for Health and Children is monitoring the sale of new products as they emerge with a view to listing them as controlled drugs if that proves necessary.  However, I understand some of the newer products such as "Whack" contain substances with anaesthetic effects and can be, and are being, removed from the market by the Irish Medicines Board.  The speedy emergence of such substances is indicative of the need for a more general, catch-all approach in the criminal law to the sale of dangerous psychoactive substances.  It is clear there always will be a time lag before such new substances can be made subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.The approach taken in the Bill is necessary to criminalise the sale of psychoactive substances as they emerge.  I am acting quickly to prevent the sale of unsafe products, especially to young people.  I am also stepping in now to stymie any re-growth potential in the head shop industry.  The focus of the Bill is on seeking to ensure the sale or supply of substances for human consumption, which may not be specifically proscribed under the Misuse of Drugs Act but which have psychoactive effect, will be a criminal offence.  That offence can be prosecuted as an arrestable offence, attracting a penalty of up to five years imprisonment.  This puts the offence into the serious category and, as such, it will be automatically subject to various powers such as the power of arrest.  The main offences under this Act are also being included in the Schedule to the Bail Act which means they are being treated as serious offences for the purposes of that Act, that is, as offences for which bail can be refused.Some criticism has been voiced that this Bill will not work because it does not incorporate a structure to bring together expertise to identify psychoactive substances.  This criticism ignores the fact that under existing arrangements, when considering whether substances should be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Minister for Health and Children already has access to expertise on drug misuse and harm.  Controlling substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act is an ongoing process which involves national and international co-operation and engagement.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with Ireland's obligations under international conventions and EU Council decisions or where there is evidence the substances are causing significant harm to public health.  At a national level, the Department of Health and Children works closely with my Department, the Office of the Minister for Drugs, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, the Garda Síochána, the customs service, the forensic science laboratory, the Irish Medicines Board, the Health Research Board and others to monitor emerging trends in the development of new psychoactive substances.  At an international level, the Department engages with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and the United Nations Office of Drug Control and Crime Prevention regarding international trends in the emergence of new substances and drug control.I will not, particularly given the current state of the public finances, contemplate the duplication of the extensive controls operated under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  This Bill is a recognition that while the specific identification and control of substances is invaluable as a long-term approach, it is not sufficient on its own to provide an instant response to the constantly evolving trade in unregulated psychoactive substances.  No matter what expertise is available, the imposition of controls on specified psychoactive substances will be always left playing catch-up with the creative capacity of the head shop industry constantly to develop new products.  It is for this reason that I am proposing in this Bill a more immediate catch-all approach to ensure the criminal law can deal with those who seek to undermine the controls operated by the Minister for Health and Children on the sale of dangerous psychoactive substances.A particularly important aspect of the Bill is its provision of an immediate legal weapon to the Garda Síochána and to the courts.  The Garda can apply to the courts for a prohibition order prohibiting any person from selling a psychoactive substance for human consumption where that person refuses to obey a Garda prohibition notice to cease such trade.  The procedure in question, unlike a criminal prosecution, is a civil procedure.  It is similar to procedures in other legislation, such as the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act 1998, which provide for immediate action in circumstances where public health or safety may be at risk.  Accordingly, the onus of proof is on the balance of probabilities which is less onerous than that applying to the prosecution of criminal offences.  Breach of the order will be a criminal offence.  In addition, I am providing that the court can order the closure of a premises where an order has been breached, in addition to any other penalty the court may impose.Under the terms of this Bill, those who sell unregulated potentially dangerous substances for their psychoactive effect will also risk criminal investigation and prosecution.  The prosecution may take time to gather the necessary criminal evidence, but head shop traders should be under no illusion.  Those who thought they were safe to peddle newly marketed substances may also find themselves in due course defending their position before the criminal courts.  The legislation is designed in order to have no impact on legitimate trade and will not apply to products that can be legally sold for human consumption, such as medicines and food.The Bill is intended to operate in conjunction with various other avenues being pursued, including regulations under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  Several such measures are already in train.  The activities of head shops are being closely monitored on an ongoing basis by the Garda Síochána and Revenue's customs service with a view to ensuring no substances that are currently illegal are being sold.  The Health Service Executive, in association with partner agencies under the drugs strategy, is finalising a national drugs awareness campaign that will focus on the dangers of psychoactive substances available through head shops.  The National Advisory Committee on Drugs has been asked to carry out some targeted research in this area.  In addition, as part of this multi-pronged approach, relevant Government agencies are reviewing existing legislative provisions in order to establish whether head shops are liable for prosecution under a range of legislation.The general scheme of the Bill was notified to the European Commission under the technical standards directives.  That notification invoked the emergency procedure which means the usual three-month stand-still period would not apply.  On 18 June the Commission indicated its acceptance of the need for urgent legislation on this matter.  Moreover, its letter indicated that the Commission itself is moving to introduce proposals for a directive in regard to head shops that will apply throughout the European Union.  We are ahead of the posse in this respect.I will now turn to the main provisions of the legislation.  Section 1 defines terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 excludes from the scope of the Bill products which are subject to licence, authorisation or other control.  These include medicinal products, animal remedies, intoxicating liquor, tobacco and food.  Controlled drugs, which are subject to the Misuse of Drugs Acts, are also excluded to avoid duplication.  The section also provides that the Minister can, by order, exclude other products.  This provision has been included in the unlikely event that a legitimate substance inadvertently comes within the scope of the legislation.Section 3 provides for the offences of selling, importing or exporting psychoactive substances for human consumption.  Subsection (1) provides for the offence of selling a psychoactive substance, knowing or being reckless as to whether it is being acquired or supplied for human consumption.  The definition of selling is broad and by means of section 1 includes supplying, distributing, offering for sale and being in possession for sale.  It includes sale over the Internet or home delivery services within this jurisdiction.  Subsection (2) provides that it will be an offence to import or export a psychoactive substance for human consumption.  Subsection (3) provides that where it is proved a person has sold, imported or exported apsychoactive substance, a court can apply a rebuttable presumption that the accused knew or was reckless as to whether the substance was being supplied or acquired for human consumption.  In reaching a decision on whether such a presumption should operate, the court can have regard to indications that the substance may have psychoactive effects, the presence of drugs paraphernalia at the place to which the proceedings for the offence relate and whether there is a reasonable alternative lawful purpose for the substance, taking into account its cost and quantity.Subsection (4) provides that the court may be satisfied of the matters referred to in subsection (3) notwithstanding any oral or written statement or indication given on packaging and so on that the substance in question is not psychoactive or is not intended or fit for human consumption.  Subsection (5) provides that it is a defence for a person accused of an offence under this section to prove that he or she is a person referred to in section 6(2), which ensures the lawful professional activities of doctors, pharmacists and so on will be outside the scope of the offence provisions.Section 4 creates the offence of selling an object knowing that it will be used for cultivation by hydroponic means in contravention of section 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  Hydroponic cultivation is the cultivation of plants in liquid containing nutrients, without soil, and under controlled conditions of light, temperature and humidity.  This method of cultivation is known to be used for the purpose of growing cannabis indoors.  Hydroponic equipment is also known to be one of the products commonly sold in head shops.  I am aware, however, that this type of equipment can be sold by garden centres for legitimate purposes.  For this reason, I am providing that it is an offence to sell such products only when the person knows the product will be used for the cultivation of substances in contravention of the Misuse of Drugs Act.In the general scheme of this Bill, I provided for an offence of selling any pipe or other object made or adapted for use in connection with the consumption of a controlled drug or psychoactive substance.  However, in view of the urgency of the Bill, I have decided not to proceed with this provision as there are difficulties to be overcome in dealing with the fact that such objects can have legitimate uses.Section 5 provides for the offence of advertising a psychoactive substance or object to which section 4 applies.  Section 5(1) provides that it will be an offence for a person to publish or display any advertisement knowing or being reckless as to whether the advertisement indicates an intention to sell, import or export a psychoactive substance for human consumption or to sell any object for use in cultivation by hydroponic means in contravention of section 17 of the Act of 1977.  It also will be an offence to publish an advertisement promoting the consumption of a substance for its psychoactive effect and providing information on how or where a psychoactive substance may be obtained.  It also will be an offence to publish an advertisement providing information on how to cultivate by hydroponic means in contravention of section 17 of the Act of 1977.  Section 5(2) provides that it is a defence for a person accused of an offence under this section to prove that he or she is a person referred in section 6.Section 6 provides that certain categories of persons, such as doctors, dentists, etc. who sell or advertise psychoactive substances will not commit an offence if their actions are lawful for the purpose of their profession.Section 7 provides that a garda superintendent, or higher, may serve a prohibition notice on a person where he or she believes the person is selling, importing or exporting psychoactive substances for human consumption, selling hydroponic equipment or advertising psychoactive substances.  A prohibition notice will specify the activities in respect of which the garda opinion is held and the reasons for it.  It will direct the person to cease immediately the activities specified in the notice and will set out the possible consequences of failure to comply with the direction specified in the notice.Section 8 provides that where a garda superintendent, or higher, is of the opinion that a person is not in compliance with a direction contained in a prohibition notice, he or she may apply to the District Court for an order prohibiting the person from engaging in specified activities.  The application must be on notice to the person concerned.  The court may make a prohibition order if it is satisfied that the person concerned has engaged in an activity specified in the prohibition notice and it is necessary to prevent the person from continuing to engage in such activity.  The circumstances which the court may take into account include indications that the substance may have psychoactive effects, the presence of drugs paraphernalia at the place to which the application relates and whether there is a reasonable alternative lawful purpose for the substance or object, taking into account its cost and quantity.  The court may decide not to make a prohibition order where it considers that making the order would be unjust in all the circumstances of the case.This is a civil rather than criminal procedure so the proof required will be on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt.  A person who fails to comply with a prohibition order will be guilty of an offence and a person who is the subject of a prohibition order may appeal the order to the Circuit Court.Section 9 makes provision for the variation of prohibition orders by the District Court.Section 10 provides that where a person is convicted of any of the main offences under the Act, including the offence under section 8(6) of failing to comply with a prohibition order, the court may make a closure order in relation to a specified place.  A person who fails to comply with a closure order will be guilty of an offence.Section 11 provides that the District Court may vary or discharge a closure order on application by the occupier or owner of the place concerned or a garda superintendent and sets out the procedure for such applications.  Sections 12, 13 and 16 provide for Garda powers to search suspects and search and seize places, vehicles, etc.  Section 14 extends those powers to officers of Customs and Excise in cases of unlawful importation or exportation of psychoactive substances.  I will table amendments to this section to fully ensure that there is no gap in the necessary powers available to officers of Customs and Excise to deal with this trade.  Section 15 provides for an offence of obstructing a garda or customs officer in the exercise of his or her functions under the Bill.Section 17 makes provision for the designation of laboratories for the examination of substances for the purposes of the Bill.  The Forensic Science Laboratory is specifically designated as such a laboratory.  Section 18 contains provisions relating to evidence in proceedings under the Bill.  Section 19 provides for the disposal of things seized for use in evidence in criminal proceedings under the Bill.  Section 20 provides that a person guilty of an offence under the Bill is liable on summary conviction to a fine of €5,000 or imprisonment for up to 12 months or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment not exceeding five years or both.  It also includes standard provisions regarding offences by bodies corporate and forfeiture of substances, etc. on conviction for an offence under the Bill.Section 21 is a technical jurisdiction clause.  Section 22 extends the powers of search and seizure of customs officers at ports and points of entry to the State for controlled drugs under section 2 of the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1988 to psychoactive substances.Section 23 will add the principal offences under the Bill to the Schedule to the Bail Act 1997.  Section 2 of that Act permits a court to refuse bail to a person charged with a serious offence if such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person.  A serious offence means an offence listed in the Schedule to the Bail Act which is punishable by five years imprisonment or more.Section 24 is a standard provision relating to the making of regulations and the laying of orders made by the Minister before each House of the Oireachtas, while section 25 is a standard provision regarding expenses incurred in the administration of the Bill and section 26 provides for the short title of the Bill and its commencement.The House will appreciate that this is an important Bill which has community safety at its heart.  It gives a strong message to those who seek to put that safety at risk and who seek to undermine the legal framework of this country for controlled drugs.  In this Bill, I have sought to match the creative circumvention of the law by those who sell unregulated psychoactive substances with equally creative criminal and civil law provisions.  These provisions not only make such trade a criminal offence, they also bestow strong powers on the gardaí and on the courts to use the less onerous civil law procedures to prohibit such sale and ultimately close down places selling such substances.This Bill should not be seen to operate in isolation.  It is a catch-all approach and, as such, a support to the more specific approach taken in the Misuse of Drugs Acts which identifies and controls specified substances.  The Minister for Health and Children will continue to monitor unregulated psychoactive substances emerging on the market with a view to listing them as controlled substances, if necessary using the emergency procedure.  I intend to ensure that the situation regarding head shops is proactively monitored.  I will not hesitate to come back to this House with further provisions to deal with the problem if such action is deemed necessary.I appreciate the level of cross-party support which has been expressed for this Bill.  I thank the Opposition parties in anticipation of the speedy passage of this Bill before the summer recess.  I accept the Bill was published only recently but we had a good debate on it in the Seanad, where it was broadly welcomed.This is part of a multi-pronged approach.  It was clear to the Government that the Misuse of Drugs Act is limited in its application when new products are coming onto the market constantly.  When we signed the order on the Misuse of Drugs Act and the specified items under that order, we were under no illusion that the goalposts would be quickly shifted.  While most shops closed, and in fairness to the gardaí, they were on the street within hours of the order being signed, there are clearly still shops operating.  The Garda is monitoring the 44 shops around the country to ensure they are not selling illegal products but we are under no illusion that while some have definitely closed, they are using other means to sell these illegal products.  As far as we can, we have tried to stop that, particularly the sale of such products over the Internet and by home delivery.I thank the Attorney General's office and my officials for working through the night on this.  It was not easy legislation to put together, although it appears simple, to cover the criminal offence of sale, supply, exporting and importing a psychoactive substance.  It will be up to the courts to determine and the prosecution to prove if such a product has psychoactive effects and that it is for human consumption.I again thank this House for its co-operation in allowing me to bring forward this Bill as a matter of urgency and I now look forward to a full debate.That is one aspect of the Bill. The other, which is the one that I particularly pushed in the discussions I had with the Attorney General, is the civil procedure of prohibition, notice prohibition order and closure order.  This will be used more frequently than the criminal offence.  As it is a civil procedure, the burden of proof is less onerous than beyond all reasonable doubt.  I welcome the Bill and I thank the Deputies opposite in anticipation of support for it.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I will share time with Deputies Catherine Byrne and James Reilly.I would like to start by thanking the Minister for his good wishes in taking up the position as Fine Gael justice spokesperson.  I hope we will be able to co-operate.  I hope that co-operation would extend to the Minister taking on board constructive amendments proposed by this side of the House to Bills produced by him, and being willing to give support to Private Members' Bills that we produce in the public interest to address issues that the Government either has not had the time to address or, indeed, has failed to address regardless of time but which are urgent.The principle of this Bill has the full support of the Fine Gael Party.  We believe that there is an absolute public duty and a necessity to bring an end to the scourge of head shops and young people being lured into using psychoactive substances, some of which have had catastrophic effects for those who have taken them.  Our critique of the Government is the length of time it has taken to produce this Bill.  In 2008 and 2009, my colleagues, Deputies James Reilly and Catherine Byrne, called for legislation of this type.  It has taken the Government too long to produce a general Bill to give the Garda Síochána powers to effectively close down head shops and have the full panoply of our criminal law available to them to prosecute those willing to exploit young people and sell to them substances that are undeniably harmful.In the context of the Bill, I want to say to the Minister we welcome the fact that it is now before the House and Fine Gael supports the enactment of this Bill through the Dáil before the summer vacation, but this Bill, with all the work that has been done on it has flaws.  This Bill can be improved, and Fine Gael will be tabling amendments to it.  I hope the amendments we table will be dealt with constructively by the Government.I want to illustrate just two or three of the defects in the Bill that need to be addressed.  First, in the context of prohibition orders, it seems that a prohibition order may be sought by a member of the Garda Síochána in respect of a psychoactive substance for human consumption, so it has to be sought in respect of a specific identifiable psychoactive substance and the prohibition order will be to prohibit the sale of that individual substance.  We have already learned by application of the Misuse of Drugs Act that these substances change and evolve, and there will be no difficulty in a prohibition order being made in respect of a particular substance and a head shop stopping selling that substance and selling alternative substances.  One will get caught within the context of this Bill in the same difficulty that one has with the use of the Misuse of Drugs Act.  That particular provision should be a prohibition on the sale of any psychoactive substance.  One should be able to seek it in respect of the general sale of them and not simply in relation to a specific substance.If there is to be an application to close a head shop as a consequence of the violation of a prohibition order, again it applies to the sale of a specific substance.  This is seriously flawed and the reality is that if — in our view — psychoactive substances are being sold, at the same time as an application is made to the courts to prohibit their sale without the necessity thereafter for a prosecution, the courts should have the power to close down the head shop, pure and simple.  A closure order under this legislation in all circumstances is dependent either on, first, a prohibition order being made, then a prosecution being successful for failure to comply with the prohibition order, or is dependent on a criminal prosecution being taken for the sale of substances banned by the legislation.The problem with all of that is that if this Bill is enacted and becomes law at the end of July and if criminal prosecutions are taken, the courts go on vacation for the entire month of August; the District Court is on vacation for part of September.  If prosecutions are taken, it may take a number of months for them to come to fruition and what we need is legislation throughthis House which facilitates immediate applications being made to the courts to close headshops.  That should be a practical possibility.  There is no particular reason legislationcannot be drafted on that basis on the acceptance of all sides in this House that these substances are dangerous, should be taken off our streets and they should be taken off our streets with haste.  The problem with this Bill, albeit well intentioned, is that the route map one has to travel to bring about a closure is too long drawn out and it gives too great a leeway for those operating these shops to continue to do so.  We will be bringing forward amendments to address that issue.What I want to say to the Minister is this: we have for many years had a problem with a broad range of drugs, be they the type of substances now sold in head shops or the substances sold by the drug gangs which are taking over the streets of Dublin and the streets of Limerick and other parts of this country.  I want to say quite clearly to the Minister that what we need and have still not got in this country is a fully focused co-ordinated campaign to end the gun law on our streets and to close down not just the head shops, but the drug gangs and drug barons who are responsible for destroying the lives of so many people in this country and who are bringing death and destruction to too many communities.The Minister's legacy in the criminal justice area at the end of his term of office is going to be a legacy of what could best be described as gun law and the revolving door.  The number of gangland killings in this State in the first six months of this year is a minimum of 12 and, indeed, there may be more.  The streets of this city and other parts of the country are starting to resemble Chicago during prohibition time in the 1920s.  We need not only to get the drugs off the streets, the head shops closed down, but we need to close down the drug gangs which are ravaging the community and who feel free to use firearms whenever it suits them to engage in their murderous war of attrition with each other over the patches of the community they want to reserve for themselves in the context of the sale of drugs.Then we have the revolving door syndrome.  I have a long enough memory to remember when Nora Owen was Minister in this House and Deputy John O'Donoghue used to, from the Opposition side of the House as Fianna Fáil spokesperson, make her life miserable, and he committed Fianna Fáil to zero tolerance.  In the context of dealing with the drug gangs and Michael McDowell's announcement as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in or about 2006 that he had finally closed them down and it was the end of their reign of terror, the reality is we have not had zero tolerance; we have had zero competence.  The drug gangs are mushrooming, continue to exist, continue to terrorise communities, and this Government does not have a coherent plan to tackle the problem.I want to pay tribute to the courageous members of the Garda Síochána who have successfully prosecuted a number of cases and put a substantial number of those engaged in drugs behind bars, but we are still not doing enough.  They are still there.  We had deaths on our streets within the last few days — two people gunned down who are known to have had criminal records and a young 14 year old, a victim of gun violence.  This has got to stop and there has to be a coherent and a more organised approach as opposed to the fragmented approach that is taken and the sporadic involvement of the Minister in bringing forward emergency pieces of legislation.We have had the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 to provide gardaí with power to gather intelligence in the face of witness intimidation and we had the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 rushed through the Dáil so that gardaí could start bringing prosecutions against known gangland criminals.  The result in 2010 in total, four prosecutions involving those pieces of legislation.This is not good enough.  It is not the focused approach we want.  The people of this country deserve a far more coherent approach.  While I welcome this legislation and the principle of it and it will be supported by the Fine Gael Party, yet again in tackling a major drug related problem it is legislation rushed into this House in the dying days of its sittings before the summer recess.  While we will support its passage through the House by the end of next week it has to be improved and the gaps in it need to be addressed.  I want, when this legislation goes through the Dáil and is being passed in the Seanad, the Garda Síochána to have armoury which allows it to make emergency court applications during the month of August before courts specially convened to hear their applications to bring about closure orders on every head shop in the country.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I welcome this new Bill which is long overdue.  It addresses a number of the issues which have been raised over the past 12 months in regard to the upsurge in head shops and the extent to which they are legally selling potentially dangerous drugs to young people in this country.  While this Bill will give new powers to the Garda to close head shops and will make it an offence to sell psychoactive substances, it only scratches the surface of the drug problem in this country.  I have no doubt that while the Bill will go some way towards curtailing the presence of certain drugs on the legal market, other avenues will be found by drug dealers to sell these drugs and make huge profits.I wish to reflect on the extent of the drug problem in this country, which has brought us to today.  In spite of endless promises by various Ministers and the national drugs strategy which has been in place since 2001, with a new and improved substance misuse strategy delayed until the end of the year, I regret to say that this country is slowly losing the war on drugs.  While many projects and initiatives in local areas do good work, they are overshadowed by the size and strength of the illegal drug trade, and the power that drug dealers hold in many communities.From 2002 to 2009, drugs task forces received a total of €197 million from the Government to run projects and initiatives to tackle drugs.  In 2009, the Government spent €275 million across all Departments in the fight against drugs.  Where has all this money gone?  What good has it done for people on the street who want to find a place to live and get clean?  We see no noticeable improvement on the streets or in our hospitals.  There are still long waiting lists for treatment  and when people come out of treatment for addiction there are little or no follow up on the services in the community.The Health Research Board estimates that the number of drug users in Ireland is approximately 15,000 but this is a very conservative estimate as it only reflects those who have linked in with health services.  If we take into account those who have never linked into a treatment service, polydrug users, that is, those who use more than one drug, and recreational drug users, the figure would be much higher.  We currently have 9,000 people in the country on methadone treatment, with no programme in place for them to become drug-free.While some in-roads have been made by the Garda national drugs unit, drug crime is at an all-time high.  According to the Central Statistics Office, drug crime in this country is up122%.  In the five years from 2004-09 it has increased at a much higher rate than any other form of criminal activity.  Last year, there were 1,293 drug seizures in Irish prisons and €38.8 million worth of drugs were seized around the country.  This criminal activity demands more action from Government and this Bill is only the first step.Over the past 18 months, all in this Chamber have heard about head shops and their products which have been the focus of the media spotlight as young people across Ireland suddenly found themselves faced with more and more new outlets where they could buy drugs which have similar effects to ecstasy and cocaine at half the usual price.  Many parents who were never aware that their teenagers might be experimenting with mind-altering substances were suddenly confronted with head shops on their doorstep.  Parents, teachers and the Garda discovered that there was nothing they could do to put a stop to this  phenomenon and the Government claimed its hands were tied.  At the height of their activity, there were 14 head shops in the inner city.  In May of this year there were approximately 100 shops operating nationwide.  Following the banning of a number of head shop products in May, approximately 40 shops are still in operation around the country.What many people may not realise is that head shops have been around for a long time, selling synthetic highs as well as drug paraphernalia.  They were previously confined to cities and are now in operation throughout the country.  However, when they began to open on street corners in rural towns communities suddenly began to take notice and ask questions.  Teenagers who may never have encountered a head shop or legal highs before were suddenly presented with a golden opportunity to experiment with products such as Spice and Snow Blow.The problem snowballed in June 2010.  The Garda stated that head shops were opening at a rate of one a week.  Protests by concerned parents and other action groups outside the shops made no difference and such action only helped to close the shops for a short period.  The owners of the shops were engaged in completely reckless behaviour and had no interest in young people and the type of lives they would lead once they were introduced to drugs. While radio stations and protest groups shouted across the airwaves about what was happening on the streets the Garda's hands were tied.  Many people in areas where head shops opened were in fear of their children being brought into accident and emergency departments on a nightly basis.There are many health risks associated with psychoactive substances and according to the Health Research Board more than 90 new psychoactive substances were reported since the establishment of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 1997.  These products, including herbal and synthetic highs which are often in the form of plant food and bath salts, present a major public health risk.  Panic set in as more and more cases of young people having severe reactions to these products dominated the headlines.  We have all heard the shocking stories from doctors and parents about the serious effects these products can have.  Doctors and experts in emergency medicine have spoken openly on the national airwaves, giving details of how legal highs have led to severe reactions, psychosis, suicidal tendencies, anxiety, stress and hallucinations.  The list goes on.One of the main problems facing medical professionals is that nobody knows what is actually in these drugs.  People are playing Russian roulette with their lives when they consume these potentially toxic substances.  The Health Research Board has stated that there is no quality control measures of these substances and in instances of adverse reactions no one is accountable.Young people in school have been affected by this problem.  I have met many teachers and principals who have had to take children out of classrooms, corridors and toilets because they have been violently sick as a result of what happened to them during previous nights when they dabbled in legal highs.  Our education system is very flawed when it comes to teaching young people about drugs and how to tackle the problem.  We have an antiquated system involving programmes such as Walk Tall and On My Own Two Feet.  Education is the most powerful tool in the fight against drugs.  If we teach our children the dangers associated with drugs and educate them about the risks involved we will go a long way towards preventing experimentation and addition.The war on drugs continues in our towns and cities which are ravaged by drug related crime and killings.  Deputy Shatter has spoken about this more eloquently than I could.  Many young people have lost their lives as a result of drugs, not only through addiction but also because they have been shot dead.  Some of the victims were innocent, like many in this room.The Bill will make the sale and supply of psychoactive substances which mimic illegal drugs a criminal offence, which I welcome.  Gardaí will have greater powers to enter and search premises and serve prohibition notices on shops which sell psychoactive substances.  It will also enable the courts to impose fines or prison sentences.  Senior gardaí will now have the power to prohibit the sale of products and issue closure orders.  Gardaí and Customs and Excise officers will have full powers to search premises and seize substances.  However, if a prohibition notice or a closure order can only be issued by an officer at superintendent rank or higher, I fear unnecessary delays could result and, for this reason, Garda inspectors should also have these powers.It is regrettable that the Government has been so slow to introduce appropriate legislation in this area.  It seems to react only when it is backed into a corner.  I have concerns about the sale of these substances over the Internet and door-to-door.  Like Deputy Shatter, I would like the Bill to include further initiatives in this regard.Our communities are being held to ransom by drugs and drug dealers.  Almost every corner of Ireland has been infiltrated by drugs and every community has its own tragic story to tell.  Drugs have destroyed lives and deprived many young people of a bright future.  This is a sad reflection of what our society has become and we must do everything in our power to bring change for this and future generations.  The Minister has my full support on this Bill.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I welcome this important Bill.  In regard to the flaws identified by my colleague, Deputy Shatter, I am concerned to know how it will address the sale of these products over the Internet.  This is a major issue in respect of psychoactive substances and other drugs sold in this country.  I have previously warned people about the issue because even antibiotics and long-term antidepressant medicines purchased over the Internet lack quality control.The big problem, however, is the length of time it has taken the Government to act.  Deputy Feighan raised the issue by way of parliamentary question in April 2008.  Head shops were allowed to proliferate because of the Government's lethargy.  I am the first to admit that legislation of this type is difficult to draft but two years is a long time to wait.  During these two years, there has been at least one death involving a 19 year old woman from Kildare who died from a combination of head shop products and other illegal substances.  A number of people have also been admitted to hospitals with psychiatric disturbances as a consequence of these products and some of these individuals will have lifelong sequelae.Subsequent to the ban introduced by the Minister for Health and Children, the number of head shops fell to 33.  This figure increased to 36 in the following week and to 48 more recently before dropping back to 44.  We called on the Minister to issue a directive while this Bill was being prepared so that all substances sold in these shops would require approval by the Irish Medicines Board and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  This would have put the onus on the head shops but, in case they found a way around these restrictions, we also urged the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to issue a directive bringing them under planning regulations or dictating their hours of opening so that they could not stay open all night or provide home delivery services.  It is outrageous that one can have illicit substances delivered to one's door at any time before 4 a.m. when we have tight laws to control substances like alcohol.  Planning regulations could have prohibited the shops from opening within 10 km of schools, pubs or clubs.  This would have gone a long way towards stopping their proliferation.I acknowledge this is a substantial Bill which will address the problem, particularly if the amendments proposed by Deputy Shatter are accepted.  However, several opportunities were missed in the time it took to prepare the legislation.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform correctly noted that because these shops are legal, people who otherwise would have noting to do with illicit drugs believe it is safe to consume the products they sell.  Nothing could be further from the truth, however.  These are deadly substances with horrendous consequences.  They have resulted in at least one death and a greatly increased incidence of illness and demands on our health services, particularly at weekends.  Dr. Chris Luke and other emergency department specialists have complained about the increased workload and dangers these substances cause.There were significant public protests in my constituency after head shops were opened in Balbriggan and Swords.  Deputy Catherine Byrne is correct to point out that the Government only reacts to public pressure and is never proactive in dealing with problems when it sees them coming down the line.  I hope this Bill enjoys a smooth passage through the House.  It will receive co-operation from this side of the House because these shops are a scourge our society can do without.The wider scourge of drugs and crime remains a major issue.  Deputy Shatter referred to the claim by a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, that gangland crime was only the sting of a dying wasp.  However, while our bees might be endangered, there is little sign of the death of this wasp.  I hope we will see further legislation to control drug crime, murder and the drugs trade, which is wreaking havoc in society.At a time of economic depression and high unemployment, many people are losing hope and turning to alternative sources of solace.  Rather than considering alcohol and drugs as solutions to their problems, I ask them to consider exercise, community activities and the next general election, when a change of Government will offer them a real prospect of jobs and livelihoods.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I propose to share time with Deputies Joe Costello and Aengus Ó Snodaigh.The Labour Party will support the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010.  The pity is that it took so long for Government to respond to the rash of so-called head shops that have spread across the country.  I say this because terrible damage has been done.  Some of the young people seduced by what are known as "legal highs" into a drugs abuse lifestyle by seemingly legitimate shops on the high street will now seek to satisfy their newly acquired habit by other means.  In the eyes of many young people, the proliferation of these retail outlets on the high street seemed to confer a kind of official approval of the products on sale.It is disappointing it took more than 12 months for the Minister for Health and Children to produce a statutory instrument to add certain drugs to the list of banned substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1997.  It was always the case that such a statutory instrument would never be adequate in itself to deal with this phenomenon given the ability of producers or traffickers to adjust the chemical compound.  However, in the 12 months hiatus head shops spread like a bushfire and young people became hooked on legal highs.  The Government is now playing catch-up.  It was because of this need for a speedy response that my Labour Party colleagues, Deputies Joe Costello and Jan O'Sullivan, published the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2010, which was designed to arrest the easy proliferation of these retail outlets and control the easy change of use of conventional shops.It was always the case that it would be necessary to legally stop new products coming on sale and replacing those that have been banned.  It is a feature of the head shop phenomenon that producers have the capacity to reinvent products so as to circumvent the law on controlled drugs.  I hope this Bill, designed as it is to outlaw all substances on the market which have psychoactive properties, will finally kill off this growing menace.As colleagues on all sides of the House will testify, head shops are a menace.  Advancing anecdotal evidence from medical sources shows that these unregulated products may be as harmful as cocaine or ecstasy.  A number of young people have died as a result of their use of head shop products and the Minister instanced one such recent case.In this regard, it is interesting to note that lawyers for head shop owners have focused on the definition of the term "psychoactive substance" that is expressed in terms of a "capacity" to cause certain effects, rather than by reference to any immediately identifiable characteristic.  They ask "whether there is any substance which might not be regarded as having the capacity to produce one of the effects described (in section 1) on the human body" and argue that the prospective exclusions envisaged in section 2(2) "implicitly acknowledge that a great deal of substances will be caught by the extremely broad and vague terms of the definition of a psychoactive substance under section 1 and that it will be necessary to exclude such substances on a piecemeal basis as and when issues arise in relation to them."It seems that the real innovation in this Bill is this very definition of the term "psychoactive substances".  For this reason, I ask the Minister to reassure the House that this broader classification is not vulnerable to constitutional challenge on the basis that it is not possible for a member of the public "to ascertain fairly readily whether or not a given substance actually comes within the definition."I refer the Minister to the 2007 case of the DPP v. Cagney where the offence of reckless endangerment contrary to the section 13 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act of 1997 was considered in detail.  Mr. Justice Hardiman appeared at one point to suggest that offences that were based on recklessness might well be the subject of some form of constitutional challenge in so far as they may be regarded as giving rise to offences that were impermissibly vague.  He stated, “From a legal and constitutional point of view, it is a fundamental value that a citizen should know, or at least be able to find out, with some considerable measure of certainty, what precisely is prohibited and what is lawful.”  While I support the innovation in the description in section 1, I ask the Minister to give the reassurance I seek.I refer the Minister to the summer edition of "Drugnet Ireland", which features an article commenting on the principle of legality which underpins the criminal law.  The article notes that "following this principle, controlled psychoactive substances need to be clearly identified in any legislation that makes their possession or supply a criminal offence.  Substances are generally defined individually or in tightly defined groups."  The same article acknowledges that policymakers may need to bring new substances under control rapidly and acknowledges that, as a result, lawmakers face certain challenges.In 1996 and 1997 I had the privilege of putting in place the national drugs strategy, including the local drugs task forces.  Subsequent Governments have built on that strategy.  The reality, however, is that opiates abuse, which was unknown outside of disadvantaged areas of Dublin in 1996, is now a fact of life in every city and town.  I have no doubt the recent advent of a rash of so-called head shops across the country has assisted the spread of the drugs lifestyle.This week, a double murder in my home area brought to 195 the number of gun murders since 1998, in respect of which there have been 23 convictions.  Deputy Shatter noted that in 1997, the Fianna Fáil Party came to power on a platform of zero tolerance.  That a double murder can take place in a quiet area, in broad daylight on a summer's evening, shows how far we are from achieving this objective.Are the products on sale in head shops effectively gateway substances to more serious illegal drug abuse?  Some users protest their horror at such a proposition.  Nonetheless, of the surprisingly large number of people who flocked to these outlets, many are now hooked and will purchase their drugs from the criminal fraternity.  This is not, however, an argument for not proceeding to criminalise a dangerous trade that has no regard for the harm inflicted on its clients or the danger it poses to public health.  Nonetheless, the House needs to be reassured that the law we are enacting will be able to withstand challenge.Central to the Minister's contribution and to the thrust of the Bill is his belief that he is "stepping in now to stymie any re-growth potential in the head shop industry."  Clearly he believes that the definition in section 1 will enable him to do that.  He believes the capacity for mind-altering or other effects that are described will be the catch-all and that he will manage in that fashion to surmount the difficulty the Minister for Health and Children had in simply adding a list of substances to those controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  The feature of these substances is their ability to reinvent themselves, the ability to alter the compound and the ability in very quick time, as has happened, to come up with new products that have new names.  I hope the Minister is right and that the measures he is taking will "stymie any re-growth potential in the head shop industry".  However, I would like him to address that issue in terms of the safety of the definition he has set out in section 1.I presume this is the reason for the delay.  I do not understand why the Minister for Health and Children took more than a year to make the order she made.  On both sides of this House we acknowledge that the capacity under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1997 was limited.  However, it would have had an impact nonetheless.  All it required was to add to the list of proscribed drugs the ones that were best known on offer in the head shops and yet it took more than a year to do that.  The Bill that Deputy Costello introduced was also capable of making a contribution in the discovery of the easy change of use whereby if it was florist's, tobacconist's or whatever one week, it could become a head shop the following week.  Our Bill would have done something to help control that.  Now that we have reached this point, I hope the Minister's Bill will do what he claims.  It will certainly have the full support of the Labour Party.

I welcome the legislation, the purpose of which is to give the Garda Síochána powers to seek the closure of head shops and any other premises where unlicensed psychoactive substances are sold for human consumption.  The Bill makes it illegal to sell and advertise such substances.  The apparent strength of the Bill is that it targets the generic product rather than the separate manifestations, which would have been the case under the Misuse of Drugs Act.  If the Bill works effectively, it will end the dangerous phenomenon of head shops.  The Bill is long overdue.I have concerns over some of the cumbersome procedures relating to prohibition and closures.  I wonder if they could be streamlined as I believe they will be difficult to operate.  I also note that the Minister effectively relies on the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act for his main proposals in section 3 on the prohibition of sale, etc.  Section 3(1) states: "A person who sells a psychoactive substance knowing or being reckless as to whether that substance is being acquired or supplied for human consumption shall be guilty of an offence."  I hope the legislation being relied upon is tried and trusted.  It dates back to 1997 and already in my constituency the Garda has been using the 1997 Act in a similar fashion.  The provisions derive largely from that Act.  Deputy Rabbitte queried whether there are loopholes as the definition of recklessness and so on have yet to be tested.The history of drug abuse in Ireland is a sorry litany of State inaction.  Here we come into the House three decades later and have to say that.  Heroin devastated urban communities in the 1980s and 1990s.  This was followed by cocaine, crack cocaine, happy pills and now we have the head shop phenomenon.  What started and remained for nearly two decades as an urban phenomenon has, through the negligence and tardiness of the relevant State authorities and others, become a country-wide network of drug dealing.  That is the unfortunate legacy of the States negligence and inaction.  Were it not for Deputy Rabbitte, who became a Minister of State for a short period in 1995 to 1997 and took responsibility for this area, I am not sure anything would have ever happened.  He established the local drugs task forces, which now represent the greatest barrier to the proliferation of drug abuse in the areas in which they operate.  Indeed nothing has been done since Deputy Rabbitte left that office in 1997.  In the past 13 years nothing has been done to review the operation, give the necessary resources and expand that initiative.The Government has made heavy work of dealing with the phenomenon of head shops in the past three years.  The number of head shops increased by more than fourfold in that time from 24 in 2007 to 102 operating throughout the country earlier this year.  It has now reduced by more than 50%.  The legal highs experienced by the consumers who bought psychoactive substances from those shops have caused serious health problems and given rise to an increase in hospitalisation, and there have been some fatalities.  Young people were particularly vulnerable and an entire new cohort of drug consumers was created.  This has particularly happened in less well off areas, such as my constituency and those of Deputies Rabbitte and Catherine Byrne.  These are the target areas where something like this can spread like wildfire.In my constituency of Dublin Central, 15 head shops were open at the height of the phenomenon, nearly all of them in the north inner city.  Several incidents of violence and arson ensued.  People throughout the country were frustrated with the Government's failure to act and marched on the head shops and on the Dáil.  Still we saw inaction.  The Minister for Health and Children dithered as she has always done.  Eventually she declared her intention to ban some of the more dangerous substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  However, as soon as she made that decision she then sought and found another obstacle to give her an excuse for inaction, namely, the requirement to give three months' notice to the European Commission.  That was patent nonsense because anybody reading the regulations would have seen that the Commission had foreseen the possibility of a serious threat to health of substances of this nature and specifically allowed for an exemption.  It took three months for the Minister to discover this section.  When she applied for an exemption, she was given it overnight.  She introduced the statutory instrument on 11 May 2010 and, subsequently, many of the shops have closed.Already new products are on the market.  Three week's after the Minister's ban, researchers from Trinity College Dublin identified nine new legal drugs being sold at head shops.  The appearance of a number of new outlets also came about very quickly.  Some have closed and others have opened.  It is only a matter of time until a wide range of new legal highs is available.  The so-called godfather of the head shops, who operated in my constituency, has now moved to Bulgaria to operate his empire.

There may be difficulties regarding free trade in that respect.  I ask the Minister to address that issue also.  We could find that substances that we have made illegal are licensed in other jurisdictions.The initiative taken in particular by a number of agencies in my own constituency, including the Garda, Dublin City Council and the local drugs task force, has been very effective as an approach.  Gardaí are very proactive and Chief Superintendent Pat Leahy personally visited every head shop in the north inner city, warning the owners and staff they could be charged with reckless endangerment.  That is similar to what the Minister has said.I will quote the relevant section of the existing legislation, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997, which states "a person shall be guilty of an offence who intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which creates a substantial risk of death or serious harm to another".  As a result, 13 files are currently with the Director of Public Prosecution and all of the 15 shops have closed down except for two.  That was largely due to action taken under the combined approach, which also included landlords being contacted, Dublin City Council planning enforcement officers investigating for compliance with planning and the fire brigade examining the premises for health and safety reasons.  Within the existing set-up there has been a concerted attack and that is what is required for the future.  There must be a task force in place to monitor any initiative coming from the drugs side and which could mobilise a concerted approach very quickly.I urge the Minister to take on board the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2010 which I tabled in the Dáil earlier this year, which would have the effect of preventing on planning grounds new head shops coming into existence.  That would be desirable and could be done at the stroke of a pen even before we go into recess.  It would form part of the concerted attempt to approach this problem, which is an extremely dangerous threat to the health and safety of young people in this country.  We should form a multi-pronged approach and deal with the issue in a concerted fashion.

Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille ríthábhachtach seo, in ainneoin go bhfuil fadhbanna agam leis.  Government action on head shops has been painfully slow in coming to fruition as four and a half years ago Colm Hodgkinson died after taking processed magic mushrooms he bought from a head shop.  Not wanting to see any more lives needlessly cut short, his family at the time and since has called on the Government to ban mind-altering and hallucinogenic substances and the shops that sell them.  They are supported in this by many Deputies and groups across the State.While the Government has sat on its hands there have been further tragic deaths that could have been prevented and needless harm has also been caused to many.  As recently as last week the Kildare county coroner warned the public of the danger of legal highs as he cited their contribution to the death of a young student.  Health professionals the length and breadth of the island have pointed to cases of acute and, in some instances, possible indefinite psychosis resulting from the use of so-called legal highs.  The substances in question pose a greater potential threat to the Irish public health than swine flu ever did.The chronic delay which has categorised the Government's response has been unacceptable.  The ban introduced in May was better late than never, but disgracefully in failing to act for so long, the Government has allowed a demand for these dangerous drugs to be created.  The Government's go-slow approach has put people's lives at risk and led to the death of some.  This is not just because of Government inaction, but because of people's own stupidity in getting involved in these drugs.  People are at a direct risk of harm and some have died as a result.  Drug dependency has arisen in some people who would otherwise never have engaged in substance abuse.Dr. Bobby Smyth, a psychiatrist with the national drugs treatment centre board, who works with those under 18 in particular, has indicated that as many as 20% of those in treatment are now listing head shop drugs as their primary addiction.  By allowing head shops to freely sell drugs for so long, a ready-made and far bigger customer base has been created for the future benefit of gangland criminals, as these addicts and users will switch to illegal drugs.  It is in that context that I urge the Minister and the Government to invest now in expanding treatment for all addicts, particularly the new legal high addicts, before they get sucked further into the drugs trade when this Bill has the effect we hope it will have.The current legal provisions for responding to this threat are not enough and authorities have been too slow and cumbersome to date.  The May ban proscribed a list of substances but more new drugs have been invented since to replace these.  Research conducted by Dr. Pierce Kavanagh of Trinity College Dublin found that just one month after the ban was introduced, nine new substances mimicking illegal drugs were available in head shops around the country.  Sinn Féin anticipated that this would be the case and in April we published the first legislation comprehensively addressing all psychoactive substances sold in head shops via the Internet and by home delivery.It was and remains my strong view that an infrastructure bringing together the experience and expertise of scientists, medical professionals, the pharmaceutical industry, those working in addiction treatment, the community and gardaí is needed to keep pace with the multi-million euro legal highs research and development industry.  According to EU statistics, new legal highs are being invented at a rate of one every fortnight.  The old ministerial system of lists of bans cannot keep up with it and nor can gardaí to whom the Bill before us assigns that mammoth task.My Bill provided for the establishment of a new authority comprising the expertise I mentioned with the power to regulate and licence the sale of all psychoactive substances, including the power to quickly ban the substance, where appropriate, in order to protect public health.  My Bill provided for a range of criminal offences but also for the registration and conditional licensing, all of which would be funded by the industry if it still existed.  This is based on the logic that if a party wishes to sell a product, it must pay for the tests to prove that it is safe.Unfortunately, rather than addressing the issue in the round as I did with the focus on health and harm reduction, the Government has opted to bring forward a narrow justice Bill instead.  Such criminal justice Bills are always limited in what they can achieve.  That said, I will not oppose the Bill and wish it success.  As currently drafted, it will not work; the Minister is a solicitor and should not need me to tell him that the Bill will fall at the first attempted prosecution.  The Supreme Court has in the past been unequivocal in stating that all offences contained in statute must be expressed without ambiguity.  The definition of psychoactive substance contained in the Bill is so vague that it cannot form the basis of a criminal offence upon which any higher level court would be willing to have a conviction.  I hope to be proven wrong but it is my contention.The Minister knows this already and that is why he has duplicated his efforts with a parallel civil law mechanism.  This particular mix of civil and criminal matters throws up its own problems.  The Bill sends out some worrying and mixed messages to gardaí.  It has indicated that selling the drugs is a criminal offence which must be prosecuted but it also indicates that if gardaí believe somebody is committing a criminal offence they should not be prosecuted; instead they should go to court seeking a civil order prohibiting the parties involved from continuing to commit the offence.  I am not sure this is tenable and it is unfair on members of An Garda Síochána, whose job is difficult enough and whose resources are already overstretched, to be expected to enforce an ambiguous piece of legislation open to challenge by dealers.I am not the only person to spot these flaws and this week I received documentation from a representative of head shop owners.  Although motivated by objectives totally in contrast with my own, the analysis confirmed my assessment.  Head shop owners will be queuing up to challenge this Bill and one of their number has already successfully challenged this State's laws on sex shops.There are significant profits in running these head shops.The owner of one such shop boasted that it had a turnover of €20,000 per week.  I am of the view that the owners of these shops have already banded together and are preparing a court challenge to the legislation.  I hope that challenge will not be successful.The proposals I intend to put forward on Committee Stage will strengthen the Bill.  I hope the Minister will accept them.  More time should have been allocated in respect of the debate on the legislation in order to ensure that it will be strong enough to deal with the blight that is head shops.

I wish her good luck in the period ahead.I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill and I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on it.  If ever there was legislation which tapped into the concerns of communities, this is it.  We have all witnessed the proliferation of health shops in recent years.  People frequent these establishments in order to purchase honey or other products which they are informed are good for their health.  When head shops came into existence, the edges somehow became blurred and people believed their arrival to be a good development.  They were seen as being similar to health shops but, in reality, the two are very different.  As the head shops developed, therefore, the terms "health" and "head" became synonymous and these establishments were perceived to be selling health products and their operations became quickly established.A wave of evil and a lust for money swept the land following the opening of the head shops.  Those who operate these establishments refer to the range of products they sell as offering "legal highs".  As a result, people were of the view that there was nothing wrong with such products and subsequently flocked to the head shops.  The noisiest public meeting I ever attended was held approximately three months ago in Athlone.  On that occasion, 400 people crowded into a local hotel to discuss the issue in question.  At that stage there were five head shops operating in Athlone.  An enormous number of mothers told their sad tales at the meeting to which I refer.  It emerged that they had no control over their children who, with their friends, were flocking to these shops in order to purchase legal highs.  One mother, whose tale was extremely graphic, convinced herself for a long period that her child was taking some form of health product which would do him immense good as he studied for his leaving certificate.  She believed he would be healthier as a result of his consumption of this so-called legal substance.  How legal were such products?As already stated, a wave of evil and a lust for money took over.  If five head shops in one small town in the middle of Ireland could flaunt their products, then how much greater was the problem in the cities and larger towns?  One used to see gangs of young people — mostly young males — visiting the head shops to which I refer in order to purchase various products for later consumption.  Their parents were of the view that what they were buying offered legal highs.There is no need to use the term "gateway substances".  The substances to which I refer are real and they are just as evil in nature as are other illegal drugs.  However, the products sold in head shops were referred to as "bath salts" and other, equally silly, names and were labelled in such a way as to make people believe that they would increase their enjoyment.  The latter is far from the truth.  There is no doubt that many people were led down the road towards taking these evil substances.  Those individuals would not have trodden that path but for the fact that, mistakenly or otherwise, they were enticed to enter the head shops.As the Minister stated, the Bill has the concept of community safety at its heart.  Enormous powers are granted to the Garda under its provisions.  The Minister has indicated that he will not be content to just enact the legislation and hope for the best.  In that context, he has indicated his desire to monitor its implementation.  I was alarmed when he and Deputy Catherine Byrne stated that some 44 head shops have reopened.  I presume these establishments are operating under some new name and are selling substances, which they pretend are something else but which are, in reality, illegal drugs, to young people at whatever price.  RTE television showed a very good programme on this matter approximately one month ago in which the programme maker rented an apartment opposite and counted the people — young, middle aged, old, professionals, non-professionals and working class — who were frequenting the place.  The numbers involved were amazing.I wish the Minister well with the legislation.  I accept Deputy Shatter's point to the effect that during the month of August the courts will be in recess.  Will it be necessary to translate the powers being bestowed upon the Garda into court measures and, if so, how will it be possible to do this when the courts will not be not in session?This is a timely measure.  I am not of the view that it took a long period to emerge.  Many matters had to be dealt with before the Minister and his Department were in a position to draft the legislation.  I am glad that it has finally emerged.  We are experiencing a modern phenomenon and the Minister referred to people ordering these substances on the Internet.  Most recently it has been possible for people to telephone a number and order the drugs they wanted for delivery.  The process in this regard is much the same as that used when people order meals from Chinese takeaway restaurants.  It appears that the ingenuity of those who wish to peddle the substances to which I refer knows no bounds.

I wish her well in her new post.This Bill, in the context of how it relates to communities, is one of the most crucial that has been introduced in the House.  I first became aware of the matter to which it relates some two years ago in the town of Balbriggan in my constituency.  At that time, I and three very committed members of Balbriggan Awareness of Drugs, BAD — Paddy O'Shea, Liz Fanning and Brian Kinane — met the then Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Curran, to discuss this issue.  In the interim, the problem of head shops has snowballed and such establishments have opened in Swords and Malahide, which are also in my constituency.The Minister and his staff must be commended on their ingenuity and on their ability to think outside the box in drafting this legislation.  Everyone understands that simply banning substances as they emerge does not work.  When passed, the Bill will have the effect of providing the Garda with the powers it requires to seek orders to shut these shops down.  That is an extremely important development.Like other Members, I have attended many meetings at which the issue of head shops was discussed.  I have met many fathers and mothers whose young teenagers, in the main, have suffered serious side effects and, in particular, changes in their personalities as a result of taking these substances.  As Deputy O'Rourke stated, such substances were previously referred to as offering legal highs.  How, therefore, could parents explain to their teenage children that they should not take these substances, particularly when they were being sold legally?I disagree with the argument that the closure of so-called head shops will mean that the substances to which I refer will now be sold by drug dealers and those in the illegal trade.  It is not possible to impose controls on a trade whereby teenagers can go into shops and purchase these cleverly-packaged products over the counter.  These substances are much more than gateway drugs.It is crucially important that we shut down the ease of access to them.It would be remiss of me not to mention the phenomenal community effort that has been made by people across the country.  I have attended a number of marches in my constituency.  The Malahide Justice and Peace group led a campaign to close head shops in Fingal, elsewhere in Dublin and throughout the country.  People gave immense amounts of time to groups all over Ireland because they were concerned for their communities.  The introduction of this legislation shows clearly that grass roots efforts can lead to work being done in this House to protect communities.At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts a couple of weeks ago, I took the opportunity to ask the Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, whether the Garda is prepared to enforce the measures in this Bill.  He warmly welcomed the measures in the legislation and assured me and my committee colleagues that the Garda will not delay in seeking closure orders to shut these shops for once and for all.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh mentioned earlier that people will be inventive as they try to overcome these measures.  I do not doubt that this legislation will be challenged in court.  It will be a moveable feast.This Bill will shut down the head shops, but we will have to keep our eye on the ball.  The problem with the proliferation of so-called "legal highs" is that it gives people the impression that drugs are okay.  Everyone knows it is not okay to buy drugs on a back street.  Those who openly sell drugs in shops in Malahide, Swords, Balbriggan and elsewhere pay rates, rent and staff.  They need to be completely shut down.I am delighted this legislation will be enacted before the summer recess.  It is one of the most important Bills to be introduced as part of the efforts of the Oireachtas to protect communities.  I congratulate the officials in the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Office of the Attorney General and the Garda Síochána who were involved in compiling this legislation.  Other European countries are giving consideration to copying it.  Ireland will be the first country in the EU to impose a complete ban on head shops.  That has to be welcomed.

I wholeheartedly welcome this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on its introduction, which is not a moment too soon.  Like the members of the public I am well aware from court reports and other sources that the problems presented by head shops and their despicable products are not easy to resolve.  It is not easy to try to deal comprehensively and effectively with this new threat to society.  The Minister has my sympathy as he faces his task of fine-tuning this Bill and keeping up with the ingenuity and inventiveness of those involved in this vile industry.When a number of products were listed under current legislation as controlled substances, there was always a danger that other products would emerge in their wake.  When the first batch of substitute quasi-legal substances were named as controlled substances, a number of shops around the country closed.  However, some people immediately found a way around this and reopened their shops.It is a huge challenge to try to control these substances.  During the passage of this legislation, we must make every effort to close every loophole as the chemical formula of the drugs can easily be changed to allow them to come back on the market again.  As it is easy to modify synthetic highs, it is almost impossible and fruitless to create an effective ban on a steady stream of products.  Therefore, it is pointless to keep adding to the growing list of illegal substances.  Accordingly, I am pleased that the Minister has decided to take another route.  I am confident this will be successful.  The new system, whereby the sale of any drug that is not licensed in some fashion in this State will be prohibited, is excellent.  Alcohol, tobacco and animal remedies are already subject to licence and are dealt with under separate legislation.  Any drug which is not licensed in the State cannot be legally sold here.  I understand the system being used in the UK under its misuse of drugs legislation, which is similar to what we use here, is not at all effective against this threat.  As a result, we must use this other route.Having examined the Bill, I note it is an offence to import or export so-called "legal highs", but not to possess them.  As it is an offence under present legislation to be in possession of hard drugs, I wonder why this does not extend to the present situation.  For instance, if someone were to buy these new drugs off the Internet from a hidden location in Ireland, they would not be importing them.  In such circumstances, it would appear that they are not breaking the law.  However, if the drugs come across our borders, they will be covered.  I ask the Minister to clarify this for the House.I congratulate the Garda on its recent major successes in confiscating large quantities of drugs and apprehending major criminals to take them out of circulation.  I often wonder whether this has had a bearing on the growth of the head shop phenomenon, which is an alternative to back street suppliers.  I appeal to those who promote the nonsense that it is better for legal highs to be sold on the high street, rather than through the black market, to rethink their positions.  We cannot condone any drug taking, outside of what medical professionals practice in their rehabilitation programmes.  We have to get away from the notion that by putting head shops out of open business, we are driving the trade underground.  The fact of the matter is that we cannot stand idly by while unscrupulous individuals put the lives of young and old people at risk.  Although I accept that the purchasers source and take these drugs, that does not mean we should not take action to preserve the lives and health of our community.I appeal to those normally upright citizens whose Saturday night dinner parties finish with a line of coke, or some other so-called "recreational" drug, to consider that they are as guilty as the furtive youths in derelict buildings.  The only difference is in the manner of dress and career or profession.  Each of these groups maintains the drug business in this country and is tainted by the murders, violence and extortion which are part and parcel of the drug trade.  I am at a loss to understand why intelligent people who are successful in their careers and respected in their communities contribute to the drug culture as they do.  I commend this Bill to the House.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I join others in congratulating Deputy Catherine Byrne and wishing her well.  I know she has a particular interest in this subject.  I welcome the Bill.  We should congratulate the departmental officials for bringing this legislation to the House.  Deputies have suggested that it has not been introduced sufficiently quickly, but it is difficult to frame legislation of this nature.  That fact is emphasised by the fact that our UK counterparts are coming over here to seek the advice of Irish officials.  The UK has probably had a bigger problem in this area over the years.Like many Deputies, I have highlighted the drugs issue publicly and spoken at committee meetings about the need to introduce legislation as a matter of urgency.  This measure is therefore to be welcomed.  This Bill, unlike some other legislation we have passed over the course of this week, will be universally welcomed throughout the country, not just in the inner-city areas of Dublin represented by Deputies Catherine Byrne and Ó Snodaigh.  The activity that is to be prohibited is evident in all urban areas, as well as small towns and villages outside the Dublin area.  It has already been mentioned that head shops opened in Balbriggan, Swords and Malahide, which are in my constituency.  Local communities have to be congratulated on their fight to bring this case to the attention of public representatives and the Government.  When people see children as young as 12 being offered legal highs, they demand instant action.I welcome the section that will ban home deliveries and Internet sales.  It is a difficult area to police and get to grips with.  It is one thing to deal with visible shops on high streets — people can see who is going in and out of them — but it is another thing to deal in a definite fashion with oblique advertisements in newspapers and text messages, etc.  The sale of any form of drug under an improper label is immoral.  We need to introduce laws to deal with such activity.I am concerned about the section that excludes veterinary products from these provisions.  We all know about the ingenuity of those who mix and match different components.  I suggest that in cities and large urban areas where there is no agricultural activity, people should require a veterinary prescription just as they require a medical prescription, because it is ridiculous that they can go in and buy veterinary products off the shelf and mix and match them.I have raised the issue of planning permission at committee meetings and elsewhere.  It is ridiculous in the extreme that our planning laws allow these shops to operate.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should extend the law or bring in new legislation which would force local authorities to insist on planning permission.  It is not right that an adjoining business should, potentially, face the danger of fire-bomb attacks, as has happened in my constituency and those of others.  We need to enforce and introduce planning regulations in this regard as soon as possible.  I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through both Houses.

While the issue of head shops has become very prominent in the media over the past six months, when I assumed my previous responsibility I became aware of it very quickly.  I believe much of the preparatory work for the Bill we have before us today was done by a number of people over a considerable period and I would like to acknowledge some of those people in my contribution.The problem of psychoactive substances and head shops is not uniquely Irish.  I attended a UN conference on narcotics where I found it very interesting to speak, at both formal and informal sessions, to a range of delegates from countries throughout the world about how they were trying to deal with this issue.  No country had managed to deal with it completely successfully because the products that are being sold are being deliberately researched and manufactured to mimic the effects of other illegal drugs and are constantly replacing those drugs.  Most countries were trying to deal with the problem under legislation broadly similar to our Misuse of Drugs Act.  We have used that legislation to deal with the issue and have, recently, extended the range of products covered.  However, we needed to do more.  The legislation being initiated today will go much further than that of any other European country.People have argued that if we close down head shops, the product will be sold illegally.  I do not dispute that, but the very presence of the head shops encourages people who would otherwise never have experimented to experiment.  As the previous Minister of State with responsibility for the drug strategy, I had the opportunity to meet drug workers, visit accident and emergency units and speak to people involved in this area and I am aware of the serious long and short-term damage that has been caused to people as a result of the misuse of these substances.  Over a year ago, Deputy Darragh O'Brien brought a delegation to the House before this issue hit the media.  The drugs strategy we published and researched includes actions relating to head shops.  Therefore, the issue was around for quite a while before culminating in this legislation.This Bill developed as a result of a co-ordinated response of a number of Departments and agencies and a considerable effort was made to try to deal with a problem that had emerged as a result of the many ways people were trying to work around the rules and regulations in law.  Some people often suggested we should licence the products.  Those being sold were products "not for human consumption" and the ingredients were constantly being changed and it proved quite difficult to introduce a licensing system in that regard.  I had a number of meetings with the Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General, Des Corrigan from the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, Kathleen Stack and our staff in the office of the Minister with responsibility for drugs and the Secretaries General of a number of related offices to try to develop a co-ordinated approach to dealing with the issue.People indicated or suggested we should have planning laws relating to head shops.  I have never supported this or licensing for head shops because my view is that it is the products they sell that are the problem.  Therefore, we should not have the shops at all.  Our legislation and our approach to it must be robust in that regard and for that reason, this legislation has evolved across a range of Departments.  With regard to the use of this legislation in conjunction with the Misuse of Drugs Act, the Garda and Revenue and Customs officers have indicated their willingness and ability to tackle the range of products that have been coming through.While taking on this legislation, it is important to recognise that the drug problem does not go away, but evolves.  It is important to ensure we have procedures in place to identify the emerging problems.  In that regard, I acknowledge the very useful work that is done by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, chaired by Dr. Des Corrigan.  In more recent times, the committee has become much more focused on providing accurate, timely information.  Besides its longitudinal studies and research, the committee now provides fast and accurate information on emerging problems.  It is only in that context that these issues can be addressed.People have suggested that by closing head shops and closing off home delivery services and Internet sales, we reduce the problem but do not remove it, because the substances being sold will eventually be sold as illegal drugs and that this would not be much different from what we deal with in terms of ecstasy, cocaine or heroin currently.  However, I believe closing them is hugely significant, because when head shops emerged, a number of people  experimented with head shop products who never would have dealt with or used illegal drugs.  This was frightening and quite alarming.  I saw this in my area — as did Deputy Rabbitte — where there is a head shop just up the road from us.  I met a number of parents and families and people who thought — this is the worrying issue — that because these products were being sold in a shop and were not illegal, it meant they were licensed, controlled or regulated.  However, just because something is not illegal does not mean any quality control or standards are applied.  It is because people felt a sense of security and safety in experimenting with some of these products that for some time I have been of the opinion that licensing, regulation or planning around head shops was not sufficient.  My view is that the products being sold are absolutely dangerous and that our target should be to close them down.  That is the direction we are going.I am aware that other European countries are looking at this legislation to see if they can do something similar.  We have also looked at what other countries have done in trying to tackle the issue of head shops, but they have not been very successful.  The enforcement of this legislation will now become a focus of attention not only in this country, but in others due to the fact that the sharing of information has become more crucial in recent times.  A number of countries still use their misuse of drugs legislation to reduce and minimise the range of products being sold, but this broader legislation being introduced today will make a substantial impact and will certainly close the remaining head shops as we know them.  While some of the products we have seen in recent times will become illegal, the quantities of them being used, the number of people experimenting and those presenting with problems will reduce as a result of the introduction of the legislation.  It is my pleasure to compliment all of those who over the past year did significant work to address the issue of head shops and their products, resulting in the legislation before us today.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I welcome the Bill before the House.  It is very important legislation and will be of major help to parents and concerned citizens throughout the country.Some people have criticised the slowness with which the Bill was brought before the House, but, as the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, stated,  so many agencies and Departments are involved it was always going to take time to prepare the legislation.  From the planning perspective there are the local authorities; in addition the Departments of Justice and Law Reform, Health and Children and the Environoment, Heritage and Local Government are involved, and it is probable that other Departments have input into the legislation.In general, the Bill is welcome.  Even in rural towns and constituencies, there has been a significant increase in the number of head shops which opened in recent months.  They do not appear to have to abide by any regulations, whether involving planning, health, justice or any other issue.  They just open willy-nilly and sell what they want to sell without any concern for the public.Most of the head shops that opened in my town, Enniscorthy, were situated close to nightclubs from which up to 1,000 young people might emerge at 3 or 4 a.m.  They stayed open although off-licences in this area close at 10 or 11 p.m and even the pubs close at a much earlier time.  Head shops did not seem to have any closure time, however, and as a result many young people were attracted to them when they came from the discos, with alarming consequences for their health.  It baffled me why, if an ordinary citizen wished to open a shop in Enniscorthy, Wexford or any part of the country, he or she had to get planning permission for change of use, for example, if a sweet shop was to become a clothes shop or a clothes shop change its use.  A head shop, however, could open up and operate.In recent months there has been tremendous publicity in the national media, in print and on television and radio, about the consequences of head shops and the lack of control over them.  This has highlighted the problems faced by families.  There were many public meetings of concerned parents, some of which I attended, as did most other Deputies.  The families were crying out for this type of legislation and for politicians to take action.  We brought these complaints to the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and other Ministers.  The Minister, Deputy Ahern, listened and has now implemented this legislation.Some Deputies have proposed changes to the legislation as it moved through the Houses.  So be it.  If Deputies on either side of the House have good recommendations or amendments to make, the Minister should listen and take them on board.  It is most important that the legislation be watertight and that we would not have a situation whereby, when the Bill is implemented, the people concerned, who are well able to create new substances and new names that can be defined as legal, will be able to sell them under or over the counter.  The Minister must ensure the legislation is watertight and easily applied, that the Garda will have the necessary powers to enforce it and that health personnel will have the necessary powers to investigate what is being sold, check whether it is legal or otherwise, and deal with it.As the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, said, many young people see the word "legal" and think the substance in question is all right to use.  However, just because something is legal does not always mean it is good for a person.  There is not enough information on the Internet or otherwise about head shops, their products and the effects of the products, and this is of major concern to parents.  It is not only the person who takes the drug who is affected and has problems; there is the wider effect on the family and friends.  Relationships within families and among friends can be ruined and there can be a profound negative effect on the dynamics and functioning of families.  Family conflict can develop between parents, the person seen as the legal drug user and his or her brothers and sisters and the wider family.Many parents have expressed serious anger to me, and, I am sure, to other politicians, about the loss experienced when a person is seriously damaged by taking these drugs, and of their shame and disappointment.  Evidence emerged in March of two friends in England, a Mr. Wainwright and a Mr.Smith, who died from the effects of methadrone.  Many other deaths are being investigated which has left parents and families very anxious.Councillors and politicians throughout the county have received representations from families on this issue, asking us why we were being so slow to close down the head shops.  We now have the legislation and it is important that we move it quickly through this House and the Seanad to ensure it is in place as quickly as possible and that there will not be a situation where head shops are allowed to open on every street corner without any regulation, rules or requirement to report to the different agencies involved.The Minister moved very quickly but there is one area I ask him to look at, which has been raised by different Deputies, namely, planning permission.  This may not relate directly to the Minister for Justice and Law Reform; the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should be able to implement planning regulations to ensure that people who want to open shops of any kind must apply for planning permission.  To that end, the Minister, Deputy John Gormley must also have a say in this legislation.It is evident that head shops celebrate and facilitate a culture of drug abuse and dependence in the same way as illegal drug operators do.  It is made too easy for young people when there is a shop on every corner selling these substances very cheaply.  Some people might never have taken these drugs if it had not been as easy as it is at present to acquire them, given the number of head shops throughout the country.  The paraphernalia and products sold show how anti-social these establishments have become.  It has been said that one head shop has opened every week in Ireland during the past year.  This is an unpleasant reality but it is important to realise this is not only an Irish problem but worldwide.  It is also important to recognise that the Minister has acknowledged the problem in this country.  Ireland is probably the first country to try to deal effectively with this.I fully support the Bill.  I ask the Minister to ensure it goes through both Houses as quickly as possible.  If spokespersons or any Deputies on either side of the House have any good amendments to propose, the Minister should consider taking them on board to ensure the Bill is as watertight as possible, and that it reflects the current concern of society, particularly that of parents.

Not only is it an urgent requirement, it is a critical piece of legislation.  My experience in the constituency of Dublin Central tells me that in a very short space of time a very lucrative business built up, fooling people in general and young people in particular into taking so-called legal highs.  It is a very sinister development.  This legislation, in conjunction with other measures already put in place and those planned,  will ensure that our young people, in particular, are protected from from these sinister substances.The Bill makes it an offence to sell, import or export unregulated psychoactive substances for human consumption.  A welcome development in regard to this legislation is that the traders who sell these substances can no longer hide behind the sinister practice of selling substances as plant food, bath salts or incense when it is patently obvious to them that the substance they sell will be consumed in some form, whether smoked, injected, inhaled or swallowed.We have had head shops in Dublin Central for the last 15 years.  They quietly did their business and there was never an issue with them, but over the last two and a half years, there has been an explosion of them.  At one stage we had four.  We then went to 17 and we ended up at the start of this year with over 30 in my constituency.  These 30 shops were open all hours every day and quite a number of them were adjacent to primary and secondary schools.  Others were adjacent to pubs and nightclubs, where young people gather in big numbers.  There was obviously much thought put into the siting of many of these head shops.  The shops would not have worked in some areas, but their owners certainly picked sites and premises they knew would work.  Anecdotal evidence exists about the money which passes through these premises.  It is a huge business.This Bill gives the Garda Síochána the opportunity to take firm and direct action on the illegal sale of substances.  It gives the power to the Garda and to the courts to close unscrupulous traders who ignore a notice to cease.  They do that by means of prohibition and closure orders.  That is a direct power given to the Garda to take firm and direct action.Numerous groups and organisations, schools and different church groups have come to me and other public representatives in my area to speak about the harm these shops are causing.  There was a deliberate targeting of young people for the sale of some of these substances.  There were queues of young people outside premises in my area in the early hours of the morning trying to buy them.  Word of mouth spreads very fast in a young community even without advertising.  Leaflets were later sent around houses offering delivery services.  Other anecdotal evidence suggested that vehicles were being used to deliver substances to various different locations around the north inner city.The worrying aspect about all this was that by promoting so-called legal highs, it misled people into thinking that the substances are safe to use.  People who would not ordinarily get involved in taking any kind of stimulant other than alcohol took these substances even though they had no idea what effect it would have on them.  Those who are unfortunate enough to be addicted to drugs in the first place were taking substances in conjunction with illegal drugs and this had serious implications for their health.  People who were trying to get rid of their habit were under constant pressure because these shops were open at all hours of the day and night selling these mind altering substances.  One head shop was within 20 yards of a major drug treatment centre in the north inner city.  People who had received their methadone treatment and carried out their tests were walking straight across the road into a head shop to buy other substances.The problem with many of these substances related to a complete lack of information on the ingredients, the provenance of the products and their effects.  There is absolutely no quality control and a totally misleading system of labelling.  There is no acceptance by those who are selling these products that there are dangerous consequences for the people to whom they sell.  We spend millions of euro developing medical products in this country and the pharmaceutical industry is one of our biggest employers.  Huge sums of money are put into research and development, testing and control of these substances, yet people can make a phone call and order for delivery a substance the effects of which nobody knows.  That is quite ironic.This Bill will help solve a lot of these problems, along with other measures that must be in place.  The listing of further substances under the banned substance list at the Department of Health and Children is crucial.  We are spending €250 million per year implementing the drugs strategy.  There are five pillars to the strategy, and these pillars include rehabilitation, education and policing.  We are spending all this money on protecting our children from drug abuse, yet these people have been able to come in and sell mind-altering substances indiscriminately.  That is why I welcome the Bill.A multifaceted approach must be taken to this.  In his opening remarks, the Minister mentioned the different Departments working closely with the Office of the Minister for Drugs, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise, the forensic science laboratory, the Irish Medicines Board and the Health Research Board.  All these State agencies are involved in trying to ensure that our young people are not left open to abuse by unscrupulous people who will literally sell them anything at any time of the day or night, will charge them dearly for it, and will not acknowledge that there are mental health consequences, physical health consequences and social consequences for their families and their wider communities.  There is no recognition of that.This is Bill is crucial in ensuring that the illegal sale of mind-altering substances is kept tightly under control, is tackled head on and that communities do not suffer as a result.

I notice that Deputy Reilly is not the first deputy leader of Fine Gael from Dublin North.  I do not think it is requirement for the job, but it certainly does not seem to do any harm.I thank the Minister for bringing this comprehensive, innovative and hopefully effective Bill before us.  I am glad it has widespread support for its early implementation, using civil procedures that are not unlike procedures with which I was familiar as Minister of State with responsibility for horticulture and food.  A premises can be closed down by the Food Safety Authority if it is doing damage to people's health and the head shop certainly falls under that category and needs legislation in it own right.  I know the Garda Síochána will welcome the opportunity of using these powers, because gardaí are bedevilled by the anomaly of head shops in communities that are vehemently opposed by communities, but which nonetheless seem to have found a way of continuing to operate under the radar from a legal point of view.  As the Minister said, the veneer of respectability high street premises can give to those who trade in these products must be ended, and that will be ended by this legislation.  I hope this form of endangerment, particularly of our young people, will no longer be given that veneer of respectability.I am speaking as a Deputy who represents Dublin North but also as one of the founders of the Balbriggan Awareness of Drugs Group, to which previous speakers referred, some 15 years ago when community activists bravely came together to confront the threatening behaviour and the scourge of drugs in some communities.  People such as Liz Fanning and Margaret Wilde, Brian Kinane, Paddy O'Shea and Fran Carroll confronted intimidatory type of behaviour to bring together the community and to give the example of a community standing up for itself, not in a vigilante way but in a way that was focused on helping other parents who may have felt they were unable to cope with the peer pressure their children were under to dabble with drugs.That legacy has built up a strong tradition of parent to parent courses.  The Government has recognised the importance of the courses and I hope it will continue to support them in every way possible and face up to the challenges in this area.  Many of the people who avail of them would, on reflection, probably be the people who are best equipped to deal with this issue.  It is the people who are most vulnerable who seem to be the most reluctant to reach out and help either because of fear or a feeling of being overwhelmed, or for some other reason.  We have a responsibility to try to continue to reach the people who are most vulnerable.Those parent to parent courses provide a very useful service.  They have been added to by the community policing fora around the country.  In my area people such as Ena Norris, Zoe Nelson and many others are active, from a voluntary point of view, in providing that link with the Garda Síochána in the community and in the youth area, particularly in youth services such as like Balbriggan Youth Service and Foróige.  People such as Derval Cumiskey must also be commended for working along with the Garda to provide an effective response.As the Minister said, the Forensic Science Laboratory will also have an important role to play in this area.  It should be given the necessary resources and be in a position to carry out that work because it seems it will continue to be fairly extensive.  That is an issue on which I would seek reassurance.  I am sure the Minister has given it considerable thought.Deputy Reilly mentioned that from a planing point of view, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, could also take action to tackle this issue.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, about this on many occasions and it is and has been considered in his Department but given, as the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said, that the issue of head shops and the substances being devised is such a moving target, it is far from adequate to deal with this issue from a planning point of view.  That has been the Government's response.  It is based on sound evidence that addressing this issue needs to follow the course we are taking, and this response is the most comprehensive way of dealing with it.Other supplementary measures may be needed but this is where our focus needs to be right now.  Our focus also needs to be in the communities where even if a head shop has been closed, there will still be peer pressure, a vacuum and a yearning, for whatever inexplicable reason there might be, for people, essentially, to get out of their head on some substance or other.  That is reason I believe bodies such as the Blanchardstown Area Partnership, which help many communities not only in Blanchardstown but throughout Fingal, and the Balbriggan Aware of Drugs Group, with its parent to parent courses, all need support, along with the other important services provided by the organisations such as Foróige.  They will all continue to be relied upon by communities, particularly parents caught up in the problems being experienced in many of our communities owing to legacies of bad planning or lack of facilities, which continues to be a challenge for us.I welcome this legislation and thank the Minister and his Department, the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, before him, and all others who have worked on this issue over the years and in recent months.  It is appreciated that those of us who made submissions such as that made by the Balbriggan Awareness of Drugs group last year to the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, when he had the role of dealing with the drugs strategy, should now also be credited and feel a sense of appreciation that their recommendations have been taken on board in regard to the laws dealing not just with head shops but home deliveries, Internet sales and all the aspects with which we have to deal in this legislation.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I am grateful for the general welcome from all sides of the House for this legislation and thank Deputies for their comments on it.  There was criticism in some of the comments regarding the alleged lack of action by the Government in this respect but I reject that criticism.  As I said earlier, when we contacted the EU Commission on this issue it indicated that it was at the preparation stage of having a European-wide proposal for a directive in regard to this area; therefore, we are ahead of it in that regard.  Equally, when I travelled to the United Kingdom recently where I met my ministerial counterpart, Theresa May, one of the questions the people there specifically asked was to see what we were doing and they were intrigued with the novel way in which we were addressing this issue both, as they were, in dealing with it in a specific way from the point of view of the Misuse of Drugs Act but also by adopting a belt and braces or the catch-all approach with the introduction of criminal legislation.  A considerable part of the discussion I had with my counterpart, Theresa May, which was my first meeting with her, was focused on the authorities in the UK wanting to have contact with our officials subsequently to go through the type of legislation we are bringing in.There was also some criticism on the issue of gangland crime.  I do not think there has been any person who has been as active as me as Minister in addressing this issue in recent times.  While Deputies in Fine Gael approved and welcomed the legislation I brought through, particularly the gangland crime legislation, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, known also as the surveillance Act, this time last year they wanted its introduction deferred until after the summer months when the Dáil was not in session.  I was adamant that it should proceed quickly to ensure it would be on the Statute Book in view of the fact that criminal law is not retrospective.  If anything had happened over the summer months, the criticism of the Government, and of politicians generally, would have been that we would have been on our holidays while some awful event had happened and this legislation was not in place.The Labour Party, as usual, spoke out of both sides of its mouth in that it called for action but then when it got action — I put on the record at that time quotes from people such as Deputies Rabbitte and Gilmore who called for action on tackling gangland crime — it, in effect, opposed it although ultimately it approved it but again it found fault with it.  Even just last week, Deputy Rabbitte seemed to suggest that we did not require the renewal of the gangland legislation, as we are required under the legislation to renew it every year.However, we on this side of the House do not have the luxury of simply proposing provisions without examining them thoroughly.  The Office of the Attorney General has long experience in vetting legislation to ascertain its constitutionality, and every amendment proposed by the Opposition, from whichever party, must be reviewed by that office.I would have liked to see the legislation going further in regard to the issue of prohibitions and closures, as Deputy Shatter proposed.  However, as I said, we do not have the luxury of putting down amendments with no thought for the implications in terms of constitutionality.  There are certainly constitutional issues in regard to the ability of the Garda Síochána to enter private property and take action on foot of that.  Everything must be carefully calibrated, as we have done in this legislation.  We on this side of the House would be delighted to allow the Garda to go in immediately and close these enterprises down but, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh pointed out, given the lucrative nature of this trade there will undoubtedly be people hell bent on testing the constitutionality and legality of the legislation.  That is why, in the framing of the prohibition notice, prohibition order and closure order provisions, we had to be extremely careful not to tramp on the constitutional guarantees in regard to the right to private property and the assumption of innocence until proven guilty.  However, I will give due consideration to any Opposition amendments in this regard.  Deputy Shatter has indicated his intention to introduce such proposals.Deputy Rabbitte raised concerns about the definition of psychoactive substances and the danger of inadvertently including harmless substances within the scope of this legislation.  We were very careful about this issue in the drafting of the Bill, taking advice from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and several other Departments on the types of substances that might inadvertently and erroneously come within its scope.  That is why we inserted section 2 which excludes certain medicinal products and other items.  The Bill also gives the Minister power, in the unlikely event that unintended consequences were to arise from the provisions of the Bill, to exclude the substance in question.  The definition we have included is based on, and build upon, the definition contained in Article 24A1 of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.Deputy Costello raised the issue of products that may be licensed in other European Union member states and asked whether that  would have implications for free trade.  The Bill expressly provides for the exclusion of medicinal products as defined by the Irish Medicines Board.  If a medicinal product is appropriately authorised elsewhere in the European Union it will be outside the scope of the Bill.Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the absence of provision for expertise to determine whether a substance is psychoactive.  The Bill does not operate on the basis of identifying particular substances; that is a matter for the courts to decide on a case-by-case basis.  We have taken a more general approach in the Bill.  We have had detailed discussions with the forensic science laboratory which in turn has had discussions with other experts.  However, because new substances will continue to emerge form the product line, those experts will remain on a learning curve.  They will have to acquaint themselves with best international information as to what is happening in China, for example, and other places where these types of substances are produced.  They will have to learn from best international practice and be at the top of their game if they are to prove in court that a new substance is a psychoactive substance intended for human consumption, according to the definition in this legislation.Deputies Catherine Byrne and Reilly raised the issue of the sale of products on the Internet.  As I said, the Bill proposes to make it an offence to sell, import or export psychoactive substances for human consumption, including by means of electronic communication or via the Internet.  The Customs and Excise will be responsible for monitoring the entry into the State of products through our airports and ports.  Some of the websites in question are hosted from outside the State and it is virtually impossible to stop them.  We can only have a significant impact from a legislative and legal point of view in terms of closing down websites that are hosted in Ireland, but it is a problem if they are hosted abroad.  The best way to deal with the practice is to intercept the products as they enter the country.  As I said, we will endeavour to stymie the growth in this form of trade.  If necessary, we will come back to the Oireachtas if we conclude that further action is required.  We are chasing a moving target.Deputy Reilly suggested that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should amend planning laws to deal with head shops.  The Minister of State, Deputy Curran, dealt with this issue in his contribution, and it is being reviewed by several Ministers.  The Minister for Health and Children, for example, does not have only the Misuse of Drugs Act to deal with head shops; she also has a range of other legislation at her disposal, including the Poisons Act and health and safety legislation.  These have been reviewed by the environmental health officers attached to the HSE who have been active in this area in conjunction with the Garda.Deputy Kenneally asked why possession is not an offence under the Bill.  There are difficulties in doing so as a consequence of the general nature of the Bill.  For instance, a criminal offence of possession would criminalise the possession of certain industrial substances which may have a psychoactive effect.  The intention of the Bill is not to criminalise legitimate business but rather to target the activities of those who sell unregulated psychoactive substances for human consumption.  We are not targeting regulated psychoactive substances that are not for human consumption.I look forward to the subsequent Stages of the Bill which will be taken next Tuesday.  As I said, I will be as accommodating as possible in regard to amendments.  Ultimately, however, I am obliged to accept the advice of the Attorney General as the constitutional lawyer attached to the Government who gives advice on the legislation we put through the House.

As the House is well aware, the topic of regulating dog breeding establishments has been on the agenda for some years now.  In 2005, my predecessor established a working group to review the management of dog breeding establishments and make recommendations on the matter.  This followed some well-publicised incidents of abuse, where dogs reared in Ireland were sold in a very poor condition.  This was highlighted, in particular, on "Prime Time" and as Minister I was determined to deal with this very important animal welfare issue.  That is why the Bill is before us today.  The working group made a number of recommendations, the majority of which I intend to implement through this legislation, thereby providing for the first time in Ireland regulation of dog breeding establishments.  The Bill will also increase the general level of the dog licence fee which has not changed since 1998.At the outset, let me point out that no one with a premises, house or farm with less than six breeding bitches need worry about this Bill as they would not come within the definition of a dog breeding establishment.  I want to assure the House that the preparation of this Bill has involved a large amount of ongoing consultation with a variety of interested parties, including Government Departments, voluntary bodies and sectoral interests.  The draft Bill has been informed by these consultations with, among others, the Hunting Association of Ireland, the Irish Greyhound Board, which was represented on the working group, and the Dogs Trust.  My officials and I have engaged intensively in particular with the Irish Greyhound Board, to re-assure it regarding its concerns relating to the Bill.  To that end I will introduce amendments on Committee Stage.  In addition, over 650 submissions where made in connection with the report of the working group, the majority of which were in favour of the regulation of dog breeding establishments.  I wish to thank all of those for their participation and I am confident that the Bill is stronger for their input.I have indicated to all concerned that there can be no exemptions for any breed of dog from the animal welfare provisions of this Bill and that we must ensure that we have adequate traceability.  In this regard, it is my firm intention that we move towards microchipping for all dogs as quickly as possible.  I have also stated that I understand the legitimate concerns of certain industry sectors, such as the Irish Greyhound Board, and I am prepared to accommodate them as best I can.  For that reason it is proposed that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would amend the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to legislate for welfare provisions for members of the Irish Greyhound Board.  Once amended, the welfare of Irish Greyhound Board registered greyhounds would be addressed through the amended 1958 Act which would then replace, for Irish Greyhound Board registered greyhound breeders and trainers only, the provisions of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.I must stress that before these provisions can be introduced, I, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, must be satisfied that the animal welfare standards in the amended 1958 Act are of the same high standard as those in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.  In particular, the amended legislation must provide for adequate traceability, the same level of enforcement and the involvement of local authority veterinary inspectors in inspection of facilities.  There can be no diminution of standards whatsoever.  We are following this course of action to ensure there is no unnecessary duplication, something which was highlighted.As part of this proposal, until such time as the provisions listed above are incorporated into the 1958 Act the regulation of dog breeding establishments containing greyhounds will continue under my Department as provided for under the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.  Separately, the concerns of hunt clubs, as defined in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009, will be addressed through the addition of a subsection to section 15 to allow for the continuation for the time being of the practice of tattooing of dogs in dog breeding establishments operated by hunt clubs as an alternative option to micro-chipping and the addition of a subsection to section 15 to require such tattoos to be registered on a database for traceability purposes.I understand the difficulties for this sector in moving to a different form of traceability but I must point out that the international evidence shows that microchipping is superior and indeed cheaper.  The adequacy of tattooing as a form of traceability will be assessed as part of a review of the legislation, to take place a year after its coming into force.  If this review shows that tattooing is not proving adequate, we will have to move towards microchipping of all dogs.  With the exception of these two amendments, hunt clubs would be subject to all of the remaining provisions of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.Regulations will be developed upon the enactment of this Bill.  These are intended as a reasonable and practical approach to give effect to the act.  The regulations will be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the needs of specific groupings such as, for example, hunt dogs, for whom it is recognised that communal sleeping facilities are considered most appropriate.  I would like to scotch the rumours that have been put out by RISE! and others that I am insisting on central heating for kennels; it is simply not true.My Department will retain responsibility for dog control for the very practical reason that the dog control service is operated through the local authorities, while the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has responsibility for animal welfare.  Deputies will be aware that my colleague the Minister, Deputy Smith, is also preparing an animal welfare Bill which will deal comprehensively with animal welfare issues.  It will also deal with banning fur farming and I hope we can introduce it in the autumn.I want to pay tribute to the many dog control staff and veterinary staff who work tirelessly to re-home strays, pick up abandoned dogs and keep residential areas and farms free from uncontrolled dogs.  It can be a thankless job and should be acknowledged.  I am confident that the measures in this Bill will assist them in their duties.  As I have already mentioned, the basis for this Bill is the report of the working group on the review the management of dog breeding establishments.  It should be noted that the terms of reference in 2005 of that group did not exclude greyhounds and the Irish Greyhound Board was represented on the working group.  The following is a summary of the majority recommendations of that group and the actions I intend to take in regard to each.The working group recommended that a State regulated registration system for dog breeding establishments be put in place and that these regulations should be enforced through the existing local authority dog control structures.  The group also recommended that the regulations should include a comprehensive set of statutory enforceable standards for the operation of dog breeding establishments and provision for inspections by local authority officers.  There are a number of separate issues within this recommendation.  The first, that a regulation system be put in place, is one we can all agree with if only for the simple reasons of the welfare of dogs and for the good of this country's reputation in respect to care of dogs.It is only proper that in a modern caring society legal remedies be put in place to deal with a minority of breeding establishments that rear pups in appalling conditions and sell malnourished and ill pups onto an unsuspecting public.  I am heartened that the Hunting Association of Ireland and the Irish Greyhound Board have agreed with the need for such regulations.  It is appropriate that regulation should be carried out by the local authorities whose dog control staff and veterinary staff have built up a considerable level of experience in dealing with dog control issues and would have a local knowledge of existing dog breeding establishments, albeit without the powers to regulate such premises until now.  In regard to inspections, the Bill provides for inspection of dog breeding establishments, where necessary.  Inspections are not mandatory but after initial registration are likely to arise in response to specific welfare issues.I want this Bill to form the basis of a co-operative relationship between the local authorities and well run dog breeding establishments.  The provisions in the Bill need not cause concern for those establishments who, over the years, have built up good premises and practices in co-operation with their local veterinary practice.  As part of this relationship the local authority will be required to inform a dog breeding establishment of any grounds on which it would refuse to register a premises.  The local authority will be statutorily obliged to pay heed to any reply from the establishment in regard to a potential refusal or conditions attached to a registration certificate.  This will encourage a co-operative relationship between the local authority and any dog breeders in its administrative area.The working group recommended that dog breeding establishments be defined based on the number of female dogs with breeding potential present on the premises.  Therefore, a dog breeding establishment would be defined as "a premises containing more than 5 female dogs, aged over 4 months, with breeding potential".Furthermore, the group emphasised in its report that the legal definition of a dog breeding establishment must be clear and unambiguous to ensure that regulations are enforceable and to avoid the experience in the UK where legal argument over whether a dog is one breed or another has rendered dog control legislation difficult to implement.  Such a problem would invariably arise in Ireland if we made exemptions for breeds of dogs.The Bill defines a dog breeding establishment as a premises at which not less than six bitches are kept, each of which is more than four months old and capable of being used for breeding purposes.  I have signalled that I am willing to change the minimum age from four to six months in response to calls in the Seanad but this does not invalidate the sensible reason for the four month minimum, which was to ensure that every dog with breeding potential is included.  It does not mean I am setting down a marker for when breeding should start.The working group rejected the idea that the number of litters produced should form the basis for definition because the constant monitoring required would make the regulations difficult and potentially expensive to enforce.  It is my belief that the limit of not less than six bitches will exclude the majority of people who keep dogs as pets.  While there might be instances, such as on farms, where the number of bitches might exceed six, the stipulation that they have to be capable of breeding will ensure retired animals are excluded from the count provided they are sterilised.  Pups under six months would also be excluded.The working group recommended that the new regulatory regime be self-financing and funded by varying the existing general dog licence fee.  I originally proposed that the cost of regulation and inspection of these establishments will not fall on the general population but will be borne by the dog breeding establishments through a registration fee.  However, having regard to concerns of the Hunting Association of Ireland and the Irish Greyhound Board, I have agreed registration fee exemptions for HAI registered members and greyhound trainers.  I have also agreed to widen the fee bands so that a dog breeding establishment with six to 18 bitches capable of breeding and over six months old will pay a fee of €400.  I reiterate that someone with less than six breeding bitches will not be brought under the Act, the regulations or the fees.  These concessions on fees will mean that the cost of regulation of such establishments will be borne by fee paying registered breeders and the regular dog licence fee.The new fees will vary in accordance with the number of breeding bitches so as to reflect the size and scale of the operation, as recommended by the working group.  To that end the appropriate fee bands will be as follows: in the case of a dog breeding establishment at which six to 18 eligible bitches are kept, €400; for 19 to 30 bitches, €800; for 31 to 100 bitches, €1,600; for 101 to 200 bitches, €3,000; and a further €1,600 for each 100 bitches thereafter.  The fee will be payable to the local authority and the moneys raised are intended to cover the costs of regulation and inspection.  Any remaining balance will be spent on dog control in general.The fees can be hardly considered excessive when set against the income stream from the number of breeding bitches.  For example, a premises with 12 breeding bitches might conservatively be expected to produce nine litters per annum of six pups each, resulting in 54 pups.  A search on the Internet will show a healthy range of prices for pedigree dogs.  Akitas and bulldogs sell from €800 to €1,500 each, Kerry blues are a more modest €250 to €350 each and the popular but apparently plentiful Jack Russell sells for up to €120.  These average prices appear to have come down in the past year.  The proposed registration fee of €400 for a puppy farm of 12 bitches producing a modest 54 pups would equate to a cost of only €7.40 per pup.  If the breeder has three times that number of bitches, and consequently three times as many pups, the registration fee would be less than €3 per pup.  Such a charge could be hardly considered excessive if it ensures that the country has properly run and reputable dog breeding establishments.The cost of owning a dog is as nothing to most people compared to the immeasurable joy and health benefits to be gained from the companionship of a dog.  It follows that people should be careful and responsible when purchasing dogs by making sure they know its source.  The ISPCA guidelines regarding care of pets should be followed.  The ISPCA also advises new owners to bear in mind the financial implications of owning a dog.  Vaccinations, flea and worm treatments and veterinary expenses such as nail cutting and teeth-cleaning soon mount up.  The cost of boarding kennels whilst one is on holidays should be also considered.The working group recommended that all dogs kept in breeding establishments, including their offspring, be electronically microchipped to ensure traceability and assist the enforcement of the registration system.  It is a requirement of the Bill that each dog in a breeding establishment shall be microchipped.  This provision builds on existing practice whereby any dog registered with a breed association is microchipped for the purpose of registration and verifying bloodlines.  A number of companies provide microchipping services at present.  The microchip, which is approximately the size of a grain of rice, is implanted under the skin of a dog's neck.  It serves a useful purpose in helping dog control staff reunite stray dogs with their owners.  It is my intention on Committee Stage to provide that dogs in dog breeding establishments will be microchipped at 12 weeks for the first year of the operation of the Act.  This will reduce the burden on breeders from the original requirement of eight weeks.  After a transitional period the provision will require all dogs to be microchipped before leaving the establishment.The working group recommended that the new dog breeding regulation system be introduced on a phased basis using an improvement notice model to avoid the creation of a surplus of dogs as a result of the closure of substandard dog breeding establishments.  It is my intention to provide for as smooth a transition as possible.  The Bill provides for a period of up to three months for a lead-in time and I propose to extend this to six months in response to calls made in the Seanad.  The lead-in time will be provided from the commencement of the Act.  It shall be lawful for an existing dog breeding establishment to operate during this period, thereby facilitating a smooth transition to full registration.  At this stage, there cannot be a dog breeder in the country who is unaware of the pending legislation.  The six month lead in period will allow all stakeholders to familiarise themselves with the requirements of the legislation and for liaison to occur between local authorities and dog breeders.In line with best practice in regulatory regimes, there is an appropriate scale of regulatory actions which can be taken to gain compliance.  I envisage a liaison between local authorities and dog breeding establishments.  If agreement is not reached between the local authority and the establishment, the authority will be empowered under section 18 to issue an improvement notice.  This improvement notice can be issued only by a local authority veterinary practitioner and not a dog warden.  The notice will state the measures to be taken in a specified timeframe.  This is in line with the recommendations of the working group.The working group also stressed that the provisions of the Bill be meaningful, relevant and implementable.  As a logical next step to the improvement notice, the Bill provides local authorities with the power to close a premises where standards present a significant health risk.  It is envisaged that such a closure notice under section 19 of the Bill would be used only in the event of a significant and immediate threat to public health.  This provision will provide re-assurance to the public that quick action can be taken in response to threats to public health from dog breeding establishments.  While the dog warden can carry out the initial inspection, I will provide by an amendment on Committee Stage that an improvement order can be issued only after a visit by a local authority veterinary officer.Other provisions are included to ensure the correct functioning of a regulatory regime for dog breeding establishments.  It is important that provision is made for an appeals mechanism where conditions are imposed on a registration.  Each successful applicant will receive a registration certificate after submitting the appropriate fee and completing an application form.  The Bill provides that where a local authority proposes to impose conditions on the issuance of a registration certificate, it shall notify the applicant and must consider the applicant's response.  Furthermore, the applicant can appeal the decision of the local authority to the District Court.It is important that the Bill allows me, as Minister, to issue mandatory guidelines relating to minimum standards for dog breeding establishments.  For the regulations to be successful and receive broad acceptance, I place great importance on full consultation.  In excess of 650 individual submissions were received by my Department at the consultation phase after the working group report.  While in general there was support for regulation, there was no consensus on the way forward.  I assure the House that I will finalise the guidelines only after consultation with interested parties, including the Hunting Association of Ireland, the Irish Greyhound Board, the Dogs Trust and local authority veterinary officers.A provision is necessary requiring the owner of an establishment to give reasonable co-operation with dog wardens.  This is needed in general but in particular where an establishment operates from the home of the owner.  In such cases there are constitutional entry restrictions to a private dwelling on the warden, which are provided for in the Bill.The current dog licence fee of €12.70 for a single licence and €254 for a general dog licence was set in the Control of Dogs (Amendment) Act 1992 and activated in February 1999 under the Control of Dogs (Commencement) Regulations 1998.  Licences are generally issued through An Post which has increased its administrative charge to €3.50 per licence, leaving €9.20 to the local authority.  Local authorities need this income to pay towards the provision and maintenance of a dog control service.  In most cases the local authority subsidises the service, in some instances to a significant degree.  This position is not sustainable.  It is considered that a dog licence fee of €20 would not place an undue burden on dog owners when set against the other costs of responsible dog ownership such as veterinary costs and food.  The €20 fee only reflects the rise over the years of the consumer price index to September 2009, notwithstanding recent falls in the CPI.Figures for 2009 show that the cost of the dog control function countrywide is €5.6 million, with the revenue raised from existing licences being €2.5million.  The increase in the licence fee should generate at further €1.6 million revenue which will help better resource the local authorities to check licences, operate pounds and pick up strays.  A better resourced dog control function should help combat attacks on sheep by stray dogs which is a serious cause for concern and income loss to sheep farmers.My Department gave some consideration to allowing pensioners apply for dog licences for free.  This aim is laudable and the Government has made every effort to protect the incomes of pensioners.  Again, in the context of the cost of properly maintaining a dog, €20 for a licence is not considered excessive and encourages responsible dog ownership.  It should be remembered that the money raised from the licence fees goes towards the cost of the local authority dog control services, rescue of dogs, operation of dog pounds and safeguarding of children and adults against dangerous dogs.  It would not be feasible to reduce this income stream.  In addition, there is an administrative fee of €3.50 per licence charged by An Post which would still have to be paid by the local authorities for every free licence.  Bearing all this in mind, it is not considered feasible to provide for free dog licences.I take this opportunity to run through the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1, sections 1 to 5, inclusive, contains the usual provisions of a general nature dealing with such matters as Short Title, collective citations and commencement, definitions regulations, expenses of the Minister and service of documents.  The key element within this Part is the definition of a dog breeding establishment as a premises at which are kept not less than six bitches, each of which is more than four months old and capable of being used for breeding purposes.  This definition reflects that recommended by the recommendations of the working group.  As stated, I am willing to change the four months old to six months in response to concerns expressed in the Seanad.Section 6 provides for fines not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment up to six months on summary conviction for certain offences, including providing false information, non-display of registration certificate or obstruction of authorised personnel.  The same penalties can be applied to summary conviction for forgery and contravening a closure order for a dog breeding establishment.  Increased penalties can be applied on indictment.  Fines shall be paid to the relevant local authority.  I emphasise that fines are regarded as a last resort.  It is expected that the breeders and local authority can engage in a constructive dialogue to improve facilities without recourse to court action.Section 7 on fixed payment notices provides that a fixed notice fine can be issued for non-display of a registration certificate for up to €2,000, that will fall due within 21 days.  Moneys so raised will be payable to the relevant local authority.  I place a great deal of importance to the public display of a registration certificate as this will contribute to the transparency of and help build confidence in the standards of dog breeding establishments.Part 2 contains sections 8 to 21, inclusive, which deal with the regulation of dog breeding establishments.  Section 8 instructs local authorities to have a register of dog breeding establishments and requires operators of such establishments to register in the manner required and pay an annual fee.  Section 8(3) provides that existing dog breeding establishments can continue to operate for three months after the commencement of the Act.  I have committed to change this period to six months.Under section 8(6), a local authority shall not register a premises if the application is not in order, the applicant is in breach of the Act or the local authority is of the opinion that the premises is not suitable for the operation of a dog breeding establishment.  Each premises which receives a registration certificate must, under subsection (12), have that certificate prominently displayed. Under subsection (18), hunt clubs, commercial boarding kennels and charitable dog operations, for example, mountain rescue, will be exempt from paying fees but must register and be subject to possible inspection.  Commercial boarding kennels will also be exempt from paying registration fees.  I emphasise that while there will be exemptions from the payment of fees, exemptions from inspections and animal welfare provisions will not be made.Section 9 provides 14 days for applicants to make representations against the local authority's intent to refuse registration.  This section also provides that a local authority will notify each applicant whether it is to be registered.Section 10 sets out the circumstances whereby an applicant may appeal the decision of the local authority to the relevant District Court against a refusal to register the dog breeding establishment or conditions that the local authority has set for registration.  In the case of a refusal the District Court can order that the establishment be registered, set conditions for registration or affirm the refusal.Section 11 provides for removal of dog breeding establishments from the register by order of the District Court and conditions which the District Court may impose.  Reasons for removing an establishment from the register include where the operator has been convicted of cruelty to animals, has been convicted of an offence under this Act or the 1986 Control of Dogs Act or has breached an improvement order or a court order.  A person who contravenes an order under this section shall be guilty of an offence.Section 12 sets out the appropriate fees in relation to a dog breeding establishment.  The Minister may, by regulation, vary these charges in line with the consumer price index.  It should be noted that the threshold is six bitches, four months old and capable of breeding.  I intend to change the four month period to six months.  Those with fewer than the number stipulated need not worry as they do not come within the Bill.  Mr. Adrian Neilan, chief executive officer of the Irish Greyhound Board, stated at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 23 June that 91% of breeding establishments are small.  If, by "small" he means fewer than six bitches, 91% of breeders do not fall within the Act.  The matter is as simple as that.The fees are in bands as follows: €400 for an establishment with six to 18 bitches, six months old and capable of breeding; €800 for 19 to 30 bitches; €1,600 for 31 to 100 bitches; €3,000 for 101 to 200 bitches and a further €1,600 for every 100 bitches thereafter.Section 13 sets the registration charges as an annual charge payable to relevant local authority and provides that certain types of dog breeding establishments shall not have registration charges applied, including hunt clubs, charitable organisations and commercial boarding kennels.Section 14 describes in general terms the duties of operators regarding the conditions in dog-breeding establishments which operators must provide and that records must be kept and be available for inspection.  Section 14(5) provides for the Minister to invite representations on draft guidelines, consider representations received and publish guidelines on dog-breeding establishments.  I will commence that process as soon as the legislation passes all stages.Section 15 provides for all dogs in a dog-breeding establishment to be micro chipped and for updating of the database.  As I have said already, micro chipping will be prior to 12 weeks old for the first year and prior to eight weeks old thereafter.  This section will be amended for hunt clubs as signalled earlier.  I want to emphasise that the international evidence shows that we must move to micro-chipping.Section 16 allows a local authority to appoint certain persons including veterinary practitioners and those connected with animal welfare to act as authorised persons to assist the local authorities in its duties under the Act.  While dog wardens will be allowed to carry out the initial inspection for registration purposes, I have provided by amendment that only veterinary officers can issue an improvement order.Section 17 enumerates the powers of authorised persons including the power to enter and inspect any premises, other than a dwelling, suspected of being a dog-breeding establishment.  The authorised person can inspect and take copies of records kept on the premises and can require the owner, operator or those employed in the establishment to answer relevant questions.  Section 17(2) provides that an authorised person may be accompanied by other authorised persons or gardaí.  It will be an offence to obstruct or refuse to comply with the authorised persons under section 17.  An authorised person cannot enter a dwelling without the consent of the occupier or, failing consent, without a warrant issued by the District Court.  I propose to provide that an authorised person can be accompanied by a stipendiary steward or a veterinary officer nominated by the IGB or ICC where the premises are operated by an IGB registered greyhound trainer or breeder.  That is something I am happy to do and I hope it allays some of the concerns of those involved.Section 18 provides for the local authority to serve an improvement notice on the establishment if the establishment is believed to be in breach of the Act or there is a threat to public health or animal welfare.  The improvement notice will contain details of specific measures which are required to be taken within a specified timeframe and will inform the operator of the option to appeal to the District Court.  Section 18(4) provides that notice may be appealed to the District Court.Section 19 provides for a local authority to issue a closure notice requiring a dog-breeding establishment to cease breeding or keeping dogs at the establishment on the basis of stated grounds.  Provision is made for appeal to the District Court which shall affirm the notice, revoke it or give direction to the establishment.  It will be an offence to contravene a closure notice.Section 20 makes it an offence to operate an unregistered dog-breeding establishment except in specified circumstances where there is an application submitted or where it is subject to appeal.  Section 21 makes it an offence to forge registration material or knowingly provide forged documentation or alter registration material with intent to defraud or deceive.Part 3 contains a number of amendments to the Control of Dogs Act 1986.  Section 22 provides for the addition of a new form of dog licence to cover the lifetime of a dog by varying the duration of the dog licence.  Section 23 sets out the new licence fees as €20 for an individual dog licence, €400 for a general dog licence for numerous dogs and €140 for the lifetime of a dog licence.  This section also allows the Minister to vary fees payable in line with the consumer price index.  Section 24 provides for the establishment and maintenance of a database or databases and the information to be held therein.The provisions increasing the dog licence fees will only reduce the present loss that local authorities incur in providing a dog control service.  The new charges for licence fees would raise an estimated €4.3 million compared with the €2.6 million raised in 2009.  However, the cost of the service in 2009 was €5.7 million.I look forward to continued engagement on these provisions and on Government and Opposition amendments, which I expect will be constructive and helpful, on the Committee Stage.  I believe this is important legislation that would  improve the quality of life of animals in our puppy farms, something which has needed to be remedied for some time.  I commend the Bill to the House.

It is very different from what he intended and from what he was highlighting over a period of time.  The principle of regulating puppy farms is a long-established political requirement which all sides of the House want to see resolved once and for all.  The working group mentioned by the Minister, which was established by his predecessor in 2005, was set up for the purpose of regulating puppy farms.  However, in his zealousness in dealing with matters concerning rural pursuits, the Minister strayed a little, as most dogs do from time to time, into areas that are none of his business, including into the working group's recommendations.  He could not leave a sleeping dog lie.

He could not leave another sleeping dog lie in that in the Green Party's zealousness to get at the hunt clubs, the Minister used, in sporting terms, a backdoor system through the Dog Breeding (Establishment) Bill, by regulating them and in some way putting them out of business if at all possible because of his attitude to rural pursuits.

The Minister's motivation in straying as far as he did outside the recommendations of the working group has brought an unnecessary political problem to his Government.  The effort he has made to create confusion indicating that he has solved the problem for the Government shows he regards the Members of this House as quite foolish.  He has postponed his effort to regulate the greyhound industry until 1 January 2011.  He is waving a big stick above the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, suggesting that if he does not do what the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wants done by amending the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, he will do it for him with a commencement order on 1 January 2011, in line with his original proposals.

I am sure they have much to contribute.  They should know the facts regarding these matters.  The Government is asking us to buy a pig in a poke here.  It is asking us to postpone the evil day until 1 January 2011 based on concerns Fianna Fáil backbenchers have expressed to the Minister, Deputy Gormley.In other words, he is giving the Fianna Fáil backbenchers an opportunity to convince the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that animal welfare in their terms is what is important in the 1958 Act, subject to amendment, and not this Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.  It is a political compromise to kick the issue to touch for six months.  The commencement order will not come back to the House so we will not know what it will mean when the Minister, Deputy Gormley, signs it on 1 January 2011 if the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, has a difficulty in implementing the necessary amendments in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, subject to the approval and agreement of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Green Party.  It is a nice move in order to get us over the summer but the winter is coming and these issues will return to haunt us again.The political decision has been indicated to us and for that reason we cannot expect the House to do anything other than oppose this sort of sham.

There is no reason for dual regulations and two inspections.  The hunt clubs are well regulated and do not breed for commercial breeding purposes but to retain dogs for the pack.  As a former greyhound owner and somebody who knows the industry well, I realise the veterinary inspections, system of markings and the manner in which the greyhound industry is run is second to none in terms of animal welfare.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	51	It will remain like that.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	52	There is no need for any Green Party obsession to change it where animal welfare matters are quite well regulated.  The industry might be self-regulated but it is governed by law sufficiently well under the 1958 greyhound Act.The references made by the Minister in the legislation to the breeding programme show he is completely out of touch with the normal breeding pattern of the greyhound industry.  For example, he mentions certain months where bitches will be exempt for breeding purposes under the Act.  There is much new information for the House that must be examined carefully.  The powers being given by the Minister for access to premises are quite draconian, notwithstanding the fact that he has genuflected to the appropriate property rights under the Constitution.  Power of access and entry are proposed to be entered into law that would certainly conspire to undermining an individual's property rights.We should know the definition of the people allowed access to premises.  Notwithstanding that a veterinary officer is the only person who can sign off on an improvement notice, people in charitable organisations and dog wardens are mentioned as being allowed on property, with support given in various sections of the Bill.  That worries people and there must be clarity in that section to allay the concern of people involved in the dog breeding industry that a personal agenda would not come into play.  The ultimate objective and responsibility of the Bill is to ensure dogs are looked after in a proper environment.People are going over the top with regard to inspection and regulation and not concentrating their full attention on what the objective of the Bill should have been, which is to outlaw the irresponsible patterns which have emerged with puppy farms.  It is interesting to note that in the export of dogs, the person in the cab of the lorry must submit documentation to satisfy regulations and the inspection regime for dogs in the back of the lorry is not subject to any regulation when dogs are exported to the UK, Spain and wherever the animals are exported.Concerns have been expressed by no less a person than Mr. Dick O'Sullivan, chairman of the greyhound board, who has made his opinion clear on the implications of this legislation.  He has gone beyond what one would expect a chairman of a State board to do and this has clearly had some effect on the Minister.  He has now come to terms with the fact that the 1958 greyhound Act exists — which he did not know when speaking on the matter in the Seanad — and he has probably learned a little about the manner in which the greyhound industry is regulated.  He is still seeking to wave a big stick from his Department by threatening the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that if it is not done his way, he will sign a commencement order on 1 January 2011.Much new material has emerged in this Bill in the same way as it did on Report Stage for legislation this week on planning and development.  It seems to be a tactic to introduce extraneous materials in order to rush legislation through the House at the 11th hour without proper examination.  Rushed legislation always ends up in difficulty.I ask the House to consider carefully many of the issues raised today and the implications of the legislation, particularly the matters still on the agenda and which, contrary to the spin of recent days, have not gone away.  Powers of entry, those relating to breeding programmes and the powers given to people outside the State veterinary inspection system are excessive.  Penalties of up to €5,000 to be imposed on people for very minor offences are onerous.  I look forward to hearing the clarifications we need on so many matters before we consider how to vote on the matter.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	53	There is a sense of futility in the outcome that makes it almost a waste of time to speak on this Bill.  We are here for the second time this week to speak about animal matters and I am haunted by the thought of the human population in this country who, through the actions of this Government, are suffering untold hardship.  The Green Party Minister has an agenda that will be extended to another Bill concerning greyhounds in the next Dáil term which no amount of human suffering will deflect.We should make no mistake that this is an anti-rural agenda.  I love animals and dogs in particular but there is a time and place for the discussion of everything.  Given rising unemployment figures, cutbacks in health and other services and the despair we see around us in the final days of the Dáil session before the summer recess, we should be addressing pressing social and economic issues.  Yesterday, news emerged that more than 100 jobs are under threat in my constituency.  This should be debated.  I tried to raise the matter and the Ceann Comhairle is well aware of that.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I am but I advise the Deputy he should address what is reasonably expected to be in the Bill.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	55	All I got from Fianna Fáil and the Tánaiste yesterday were sniggers when I tried to raise the issue.  We should have sympathy for the families in Longford which will suffer if this firm goes out of business.Given the phrase "the Minister dismissed claims that the latest piece of animal welfare legislation has not been altered" used by the media yesterday to describe the Minister's reluctance to meet the greyhound and hunting lobby half-way, we do not so much see bureaucracy as dictatorship.  In some strange legacy-building exercise, the Minister is determined to alienate the rural population and push through "anti-country pursuits" legislation.  While doing so he is immune to the destruction of the rural way of life and traditions, tourism and business ventures.In another blow to the sport, hunting packs will not be exempt in the new legislation.  A small concession has been made in so far as hunt masters will not have to pay fees and the timescale during which bitches can breed will be spread over three years rather than one.  There is no denying that this legislation will prevent further horrific stories of the abuses of "puppy farms", designer puppies or other animal cruelty.  However, as in all these matters, the legislation before the House is excessive and, in providing protection, works against ordinary, decent dog breeders and dog owners.Some common sense would go a long way towards tempering the more glaring problems relating to the Bill.  It may be desirable, in the interests of consistency with other legislation relating to animals — particularly that which deals with the sex classification of farm animals — to note that where the status or classification of a female bovine is of importance in the context of the administration or enforcement of provisions in the relevant regulation, a cow is defined as a female bovine that has calved at least once.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with reference to the carcass classification rules and the suckler cow scheme, will be able to confirm this.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Against this background, a good and unambiguous definition of a "breeding bitch", which should be considered for inclusion in the Bill, would be "a female dog after its first litter".With regard to the definition of a "breeding unit", in respect of pigs, such a unit is defined as a place where pigs are bred and reared until they reach 30 kg in weight.  A possible suitable adaptation of that definition to the Bill before the House might be that a breeding unit "means a place where dogs are bred and born".  The legislation would apply only to breeding units with more than the threshold number of breeding bitches or dogs.  Selection criteria based on a combination of the suggested definitions I have outlined could remove the unnecessary "big bite" from the Bill and would focus it instead on the small number of dog breeding establishments that give rise to real problems.  This would, in turn, allay the concerns of most ordinary, decent dog lovers and pet owners.As a farmer who has dealt with animals all his life, I am concerned with regard to the long-term implications of the legislation.  This week, we have witnessed traditions which developed over centuries being destroyed in a couple of days.  In such circumstances, we should mourn the destruction of our unique heritage and wonder about what will take its place.  The Minster must not — as always appears to be the case — forget the heritage aspect of his portfolio.  The fact that this aspect tends to be forgotten was evidenced by the funding provided in respect of heritage in recent budgets.  In light of the legislation the Minister has put before the House this week, it is obvious that the judgment of Solomon would be required to ensure the heritage to which I refer — also our animals — will be protected.  In view of the evidence with which we have been presented, I am concerned that the Minister does not come anywhere near to possessing the type of judgment to which I refer.One matter I would have liked the legislation to address — perhaps it might be dealt with in the other legislation the Minister will bring forward — is that relating to retired greyhounds.  In light of the adverse publicity on this matter worldwide, it is essential that it should be addressed.  While the majority of owners have a finely-honed sense of the duty of care they owe to their animals, it is obvious that abuses are also taking place.  Under the general measure relating to cruelty, watertight provision must be made for the protection of these greyhounds.  These animals, like all human beings and my colleague on the rearmost benches on the Government side — who was muttering and mumbling earlier and who will have an opportunity to contribute to the debate later — are deserving of care in their retirement.Fine Gael has concerns about the Bill.  The party has been very much to the fore in highlighting the issue of puppy farms.  Its calls for regulation in this area date back six or seven years.  As in respect of all these matters, however, the Minister, much though he would prefer it to be otherwise, does not have his finger on the pulse with regard to rural lifestyles and traditions.  This legislation could prove counter-productive, particularly if a large number of regulations are imposed and puppy farms are driven underground as a result.  This could give rise to a situation where those who are already running above-board establishments will continue to do so and those whom the legislation should be targeting will, as already stated, go underground.I support the provision relating to the micro-chipping of all dogs in dog breeding establishments.  This provides necessary safeguards for dogs and owners and is an example of what is positive about the Bill.  However, the Bill goes way beyond the positive in its scope.  The additional costs and the duplication of inspection structures to which it will give rise will impact on rural industries beyond that relating to the breeding of greyhounds.  Fine Gael proposed amendments in the Seanad that would exclude these areas and direct the focus of the Bill towards puppy farms.  However, with his usual lack of flexibility — the hallmark of the dictatorship to which I referred earlier — the Minister refused all of these proposals and has brought an unchanged Bill before the Dáil.As everyone is aware, Fine Gael is not alone in challenging the legislation.  Fianna Fáil Deputies and Senators have been vocal in criticising what they also perceive as an attack on rural Ireland.  Last week, many Fianna Fáil Deputies were extremely hypocritical when the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill was debated.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	66	As previous speakers indicated, the original aim of this Bill was to establish a level of control in respect of the abuses of puppy farming.  Everyone agrees that the standards which obtain in other countries do not apply in Ireland, ensuring that unscrupulous breeders are able to take full advantage of our lax controls.  This has led to widely-reported incidents of over-breeding, animals living in poor welfare conditions and this country having bestowed upon it the unwelcome title of the "puppy farm capital of Europe".The intensive dog breeding industry has acknowledged that approximately 90,000 puppies are bred here annually and that, of these, 45,000 are exported overseas, primarily to the United Kingdom.  This trade in puppies is valued at €29 million.  Permanent identification of these pups before they leave the premises where they were bred is essential in order that their origins might later be identified.  Microchips are a practical means of permanently identifying dogs.  All industry experts agree that they are the most effective means of ensuring traceability.  The latter is essential to protect the consumer, breeding integrity, etc.  In 1995, when I was serving as a Minister of State, I introduced what became the Control of Horses Act, which brought forward the concept of using microchips to identify horses.  This concept has worked extremely well in the interim.I understand that in the draft memorandum to Government in respect of this matter, it was clearly stated that greyhounds would be exempted from microchipping.  However, the Bill does not indicate that this will be the case.  As several speakers stated, greyhounds are tattooed in order that they can be identified.  I accept that I risk being repetitive but I wish to place on record the fact since the inception of the stud book, greyhounds have been tattooed.  This method of identification has served the industry well.  The tattoo earmark is applied by control stewards, who are jointly appointed by the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.  Control stewards conduct inspections of breeders' premises on each occasion on which a litter is born.  They also conduct inspections of brood bitches prior to the latter giving birth.  This level of inspection ensures standards are maintained and the early detection of any welfare issues.  The Irish greyhound stud book is recognised worldwide for its integrity.  It achieves an additional layer of control by ensuring the DNA profiling of all stud dogs and brood bitches.  This is not replicated by any other dog breed in Ireland.  The significant costs associated with maintaining this service are largely met by greyhound owners and breeders through the payment of registration fees.My original impression of the Bill was that the basis it sets out for determining a greyhound breeding establishment is open to question.  I accept it may have changed on foot of discussions in the Seanad.  The Irish Coursing Club has confirmed that a trainer may have a number of bitches on his or her premises for the sole purposes of racing.  He or she will be licensed by the Irish Greyhound Board.  On the conclusion of its racing career, the owner takes charge of his or her greyhound.  Trainers do not manage greyhounds for the purposes of breeding.  A person rearing greyhounds will not be engaged in the activity of breeding and will return each greyhound when the greyhound reaches adult stage.  Such a person is clearly not running a breeding establishment.  An owner may have a number of greyhounds for the purposes of racing or coursing.  The number of greyhounds he or she owns will fluctuate over time, due to the normal practices of selling and purchasing.  The greyhound board operates a licensed trainer register for public and private trainers, who are subject to inspection by stipendiary stewards prior to approval by the board.  They are inspected on a continuous basis thereafter.  The coursing club operates a comprehensive register of all activities associated with breeding — matings, litters born, adult greyhounds named and transfers of ownership completed.  All greyhounds are tattoo earmarked for identification purposes.  If a greyhound is found straying, the club can be contacted immediately to determine its ownership details.  As far as I am concerned, it is unrealistic to equate greyhounds with puppies in this manner.  It has no foundation.The proposed limit of six litters per bitch is neither reasonable nor practical.  The industry depends on stakeholders breeding brood bitches, particularly successful brood bitches.  It is only the very successful broods that will be bred on more than six occasions.  The responsible approach, which exists currently, is for the owner and his or her vet to decide on the appropriateness or otherwise of breeding from a bitch at a certain stage of her life cycle.  This decision is based on the health status of the bitch and can be signed off on by the vet.  The requirement that a bitch may not be mated within 12 months of her previous litter is not workable.  The season cycle of a bitch may vary.  From a practical perspective, one may only be able to mate a bitch every two years if one falls inside the 12 month stipulation.  This will have an impact on the breeder as he or she operates a breeding regime, based on the brood bitch's season cycle and the advice of his or her vet.I am glad the Minister recognised that some of the provisions he wants to introduce for the greyhound business can be achieved by amending the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, section 26(2) of which explicitly recognises that the Irish Coursing Club is "the controlling authority for the breeding and coursing of greyhounds".  The club's constitution states that it "shall be the controlling authority over matters relating to the breeding .... of thoroughbred greyhounds and greyhound coursing in Ireland".  No other bodies or legislation are identified.  The 1958 Act exists as a document ready and waiting for the insertion of legislatively approved welfare amendments.  That has been promised and can be done immediately.  I understand the Minister has been in contact with the greyhound organisations to that end.  The welfare groups have also agreed to this practical approach.  Welfare amendments for the Act, which go far beyond the strictures of the Bill itself, have been drawn up, developed and distributed to all relevant parties and have met the approval of the welfare group coalition.While the Bill's definition of a dog breeding establishment is appropriate to the type of dog generally taken in by puppy farms, it does not apply to greyhounds, which are physiologically different from other dogs and mature much later.  I ask the Department officials to take into consideration the fact that a greyhound develops much more slowly than a puppy.  The Bill's threshold age of six months for a bitch as being capable of breeding does not apply to greyhounds, which are generally 12 months of age or more by the time their oestrus cycle commences.  Perhaps the Minister can address the important issue of age in his reply.  The point I am making has been confirmed by the Society of Greyhound Veterinarians and is corroborated in many contemporary and historical sources.  It has been suggested that a welfare amendment could be made to the 1958 Act immediately, to prohibit the registration of any mating or litter of a bitch less than 15 months old, given that most bitches are not bred before two years of age.  That change could be made to the 1958 Act without having to be included in this legislation.The Bill before the House does not reflect the ongoing and continuous fluctuations in greyhound breeding.  One breeder might own three bitches, two of which he has decided not to breed from this year and one of which has recently had a litter with three bitch puppies in it.  Under the current Bill, importantly, such a person is considered to be a "breeding establishment".  When those puppies are sold three or four months later, however, he will no longer be considered as such an establishment.  This change of status is not accounted for in the Bill.  Likewise, someone might own three elderly retired brood bitches and three young bitches in training, none of which is intended for breeding.  Such an owner would also be considered to be a "breeding establishment".  I would like the officials to address the last two points, in particular, because they are the kernel of this whole debate.  The aim of the Bill was to establish some level of control over the abuses of puppy farming, which tarnishes Ireland's reputation and is a separate and distinct problem in itself.  By widening the scope of the Bill to include greyhounds, coursing dogs, track dogs and hunting dogs, the Minister has lost sight of the original intent of the Bill.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The initial core intention of this Bill was to address the scandal of puppy farming in Ireland.  For many years, Ireland has had an unfortunate but deserved reputation as the capital of the European puppy farming industry.  It is estimated that the industry, if I can use that term, is trading in pups to the value of €29 million per annum.  The intensive dog breeding industry is estimated to produce approximately 90,000 pups per annum, half of which are exported overseas, predominantly to the UK puppy market.  For too long in Ireland, this intensive industry has remained unregulated.  The standards that are in place in other European countries have yet to be put in place here.  Ultimately, we are playing a game of catch-up that should have been played long ago.  It could have been done two or three years ago, when the working group completed its reports.  For some reason, the Bill has been taken in a direction that has slowed long-overdue legislative measures to deal with Ireland's puppy farming scandal.Over the years, lax controls have led to legitimate allegations of the over-breeding of dogs in very poor conditions.  It has been suggested that many of the dogs held in puppy farms can be compared to battery hens whose value is solely measured in terms of how many pups they can give birth to, and how often they can produce each litter.  When it comes to dealing with puppy farming, there is unanimous support across all parties.  The broad and widespread cross-party agreement on this issue has been demonstrated eloquently and will be again over the course of this afternoon's debate.  Everyone is looking for legislation to be introduced in this House to deal with the scandalous practices that have existed in Irish puppy farming for a significant period of time.  Like other political parties, the Labour Party believes measures to deal with this scandal are long overdue.  In supporting the introduction of measures to deal with the scandal, our approach, as the Bill passes through the House, will be based on the following five principles.First, the Labour Party supports measures to ensure the proper regulation of puppy farms, as was the original intention of the Bill.  Second, the Labour Party believes there is already existing legislation on the regulation of the greyhound sector, arising from the Greyhound Industry Act, and that matters and concerns relating to the sector would be best dealt with by amending and updating the 1958 Act.  In this regard, I welcome what the Minister has said this afternoon, although his statement will require further perusal.  I note the change of direction he indicated.  I am not a coursing person, but Deputy Sherlock has informed me that the hare has been truly and surely "turned" on this matter and that there has been a climbdown on the issue.Third, the Labour Party recognises that hunt clubs are not commercial dog-breeding establishments and that groups affiliated to the Hunting Association of Ireland, HAI, should be seen in that context and not be defined in the Bill as subject to the same definitions and regulatory regimes as puppy farms.  I will expand on this issue later when we have heard the Minister's reply and will show that a number of anomalies, flaws and difficulties arise in Bill as a result of the Minister's lack of understanding of this area of canine care.  Fourth, the Labour Party seeks to avoid a regulatory regime that could be exploited by opponents of legitimate dog hunting clubs.  We want the Bill to put in place an inspection model that will address these concerns.  Fifth, the Labour Party's focus with regard to this Bill will be on legitimate animal welfare matters and those relating to good canine care, which was and should be the core purpose of the Bill.  The Labour Party will bring forward amendments to this Bill to address areas in which the Bill falls short in delivering or enhancing proper canine care.  We will also bring forward amendments to deal with aspects that may lead to negative consequences in dog welfare as a result of how the Bill is drafted.Like other Members, I listened intently to the Minister, Deputy John Gormley's speech earlier.  It requires further reading and the devil may well be in the detail with regard to his intent.  He determines that a house or farm with fewer than six breeding bitches need have no concern about this Bill as they will not come under the definition of a dog breeding establishment.  The difficulty in this regard is that a number of dog hunting clubs do not keep all their dogs in one kennel, but they are dispersed throughout various kennels, mostly on the owner's property.  How does the Minister define a dog breeding establishment in the context of them being dispersed and not in one location?  How does he count the breeding bitches?  Will breeding bitches be counted per club or per individual club member or owner?  The certification process required in the legislation requires that a dog breeding establishment must display a certificate outside it.  A well-known song in Cork, "The Boys of Fair Hill", is based around a famous hunting club.  Is it possible that as a result of this Bill a person walking up Fair Hill will see dog breeding establishment certificates displayed outside many of the houses on the street?  The Minister must consider seriously how this will be administered at local level.  The Bill will create a mass of bureaucracy for clubs that hunt legitimately, whether drag hunting or fox hunting.  These are clubs that take great care of the their hounds.The Minister said that micro-chipping dogs was cheaper than tattooing them.  What evidence has he got for that?  There may be a strong argument for micro-chipping dogs bred for commercial purposes, because of what is involved in moving, exporting and importing them.  However, hounds owned by a club do not move about as much and tattooing is simple and has worked to date.  If, for example, a hound goes missing after a hunt, the club members will spend days, if necessary, looking for that dog.  If a hound turns up anywhere in the country, the dog inspector lifts its ear and finds its tattoo and calls the hunt club.  One does not find hounds in pounds.  These are not the type of dog found in a pounds.  As soon as a hound goes missing, the club begins searching for it.  The Minister needs to revisit the section requiring across the board micro-chipping.The Minister spoke about the two amendments he intends to bring forward and I would like to hear more about them.  This Bill spent an extensive period of time in the Seanad, but, unfortunately, the Dáil will have less time on it.  The Bill will go through every Stage in the Dáil in less than the equivalent of a working day.  Second Stage of the Bill will not be completed this evening which means we will not hear the Minister's response until next Thursday afternoon, the day the Dáil will rise for the summer recess.  On completion of Second Stage, the debate will go to Committee and Remaining Stages.  This process makes for bad legislation.  In recent years we have seen that such legislation gives rise to problems further down the line.  What is the motivation behind this?  Does the Minister think he has the monopoly on the best thinking on animal welfare?  He does not.  All Members share that.I fail to understand why the Bill is being rushed through the House and will be guillotined next week, given the extensive period of time given to it in the Seanad.  Why has the Minister decided it must be rushed through this House, particularly in view of the fact that he has put a stay on its commencement until 1 January because he needs to deal with some issue relating to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  We are all aware that this method of dealing with the Bill makes for bad legislation and I could mention some examples of other legislation handled by the Minister's office which has given rise to similar difficulties.I welcome the Minister's proviso that bitches must be four months old before being used for breeding.  When this was debated in the Seanad, my colleague, Senator Dominic Hannigan, brought this issue to the Minister's attention.  A number of times during that debate, it seemed the Minister was unfamiliar with the broad issue.  That is regrettable and is ironic in that it was he who broadened the extent of the Bill from puppy farming.  It seems he did so without an understanding of the direction he was taking with the Bill.There are contradictions in the Bill, one of which relates to the how charges are being applied.  Hunting clubs are not commercial breeding establishments and their costs cannot be seen in the same context as costs arising in puppy farms or dog breeding establishments, where thousands of euro are made each year.  Such clubs are "not for profit" clubs that provide access to an activity or pursuit.  However, there appear to be contradictions in what the Minister said in this regard.  Fees to be imposed on hunting clubs are similar to those being imposed on dog breeding establishments, without regard to the fact that hunting clubs do not derive an income from breeding.  The logic behind the fee seems to be based on an income from breeding.I would dispute some of the figures the Minister gave regarding the cost of buying a dog from a dog breeding establishment.  He seems to have underestimated the cost of some of those dogs.   On the open market a bull dog costs in the region of €5,000 because of the Caesarean birth the breed requires and the expense of the veterinary treatment needed to manage this.  That reinforces my earlier point that the type of moneys involved in these establishments and to be gained from certain breeds is significant.  I reiterate this is a multi-million euro industry.  One must compare like with like, however, because there are dogs which are not kept for commercial purpose and are not bred continually.  A female hound may not be bred for several years, but as defined in this legislation, the situation of that hound is seen as equivalent to that of a dog breeding establishment.There is another matter I wish to raise.  Given that some clubs keep their dogs in dispersed mode, how will the new inspection regime operate and how will clubs register?  If club members hold dogs in different locations, for example, in two different local authority regions, how will the Bill address that?  How will those clubs register with an individual local authority?  Which will they choose?  If a club is in Cork, for example, will it register with Cork City Council?  Will the club count its hounds and note that it has more hounds in the Cork city area than in the area covered by Cork County Council?  If so, it should register with Cork City Council.  How then, will the inspection regime work?  Who will do the inspection if multiple local authorities are involved?  Clarity must be supplied on this by the Minister.Furthermore, the non-displaying of a certificate will bring a fine of €2,000.  If club member has half a dozen or a dozen dogs on his or her property, will he or she be compelled to display the same type of certification outside the house as a commercial breeding establishment does?  Will the person be open to the same type of fines as a commercial breeding establishment if he or she does not comply?  There are significant differences between both situations.I do not wish to miss out on the puns that have issued this afternoon.  The Minister indicated that the charges involved will be related to the consumer price index.  We will have a consumer watch dog as a result because if clubs have to pay money on the basis of the consumer price index there will be a challenge at some stage or other as to whether fees should go up or down due to that linkage.As I stated, the Minister' s speech will require some in-depth reading.  I am not entirely sure what he means.  The decision to take the greyhound industry out of the legislation and to amend the 1958 Act is one the Labour Party has proposed for some time.  I welcome the indication the Minister gave that this has been done.  However, issues regarding inspections must still be worked out.  The Minister stated today that only a vet can make a final report following an inspection.  In my reading of the Bill, as laid out at present, it is unclear who is allowed to do the initial inspection.  It is implied in the memorandum and, to some extent, in the Bill that the initial inspections can be contracted out by local authorities to different groups or individuals.  In regard to what the Minister has stated, and given that he has given recognition to the greyhound industry and the Hunting Association of Ireland, does he now acknowledge that the type of inspection regimes to be put in place also need to be adapted to the nuances of those two areas?  Will he tighten up the area regarding those permitted to carry out inspections?  If local authorities begin to engage in subcontracting out the inspection regime, it will be open to different stakeholders with different interests to come in and put a particular determination as to how inspections are carried out.I came to the Dáil three years ago.  I do not claim the Labour Party has a monopoly of either good or bad ideas.  The Green Party has had both good and bad ideas.  What I have learned most of all during that period is that it is not having a good idea in Government that counts but legislating for and implementing a good idea.  To date, what we have witnessed from the Green Party are some good and bad ideas being very poorly legislated.  Yesterday, the House witnessed the passage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.  The Tánaiste went on record to say the Government had mismanaged it and did not deal properly with the implementation of that legislation in this House.  The Green Party's track record on this in the past three years is appalling.  Legislation is pulled into the quagmire unnecessarily by that party, as happened with the current Bill until the Minister cleared up certain aspects.One can take the example of the tax on second homes where last year "Liveline" more or less determined the course of legislation in the Seanad when this matter was being discussed.  There was a debacle over caravans, second homes and granny flats and all the rest.  There was the introduction of a new vehicle registration tax in the middle of the car sales year which brought an already under pressure car commercial sales industry to its knees and brought sales to a dead stop.  Legislation that should have been introduced at the start of the car sales years was brought in at the mid point of the year.A car park levy was announced but is yet to implemented.  However, my favourite of all the Green Party measures introduced in recent years was the Minister, Deputy Gormley's nuclear test ban Bill.  A person found guilty of detonating a nuclear bomb would be jailed for 12 months or given a €5,000 fine.  That is a classic.

As long this Dáil lasts I hope to see that only will the Green Party learn the style of office to which it may become accustomed but that it will become accustomed to managing legislation as it comes before the House.  A lesson was learned here today by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, who came into the Chamber with his tail between his legs because he had to do a U-turn on legislation.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I thank the Labour Party for allowing me time.  When this Bill was published the Minister said his aim was to shut down back street operations.  There is no doubt there are abuses in the area of dog breeding and the sale of pups, including the sale of pups bred in this country to become pets in Britain.  Some of the main culprits are well known and have been named in the press.  It is also true that the people in question are regarded with hostility and embarrassment by genuine dog breeders.Therefore, I can appreciate there is a need to police and, ultimately, put these people out of business if they do not treat their animals in a responsible and fair manner.  It has been suggested that as well as being well known personally, these people are also clearly identifiable because of the numbers of dogs they sell.  It might be a matter, therefore, for the Irish Kennel Club to refuse to register dogs it knows to be kept in or sold from these premises.The problem is that although their operations are illegal these people are able to operate under the radar.  However, they still must sell and register their dogs which means that self regulating bodies are able to ostracise them.  It is also up to people who buy dogs to ensure they buy them from legitimate breeders and see the premises where the animals are kept.Given that the sector has such a high level of exports it should be licensed and regulated by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the same way as other sectors that breed animals for sale and export.  The Welsh Assembly, for example, has encouraged farmers to move into dog breeding as an alternative to traditional farming and the regulatory system in Wales appears to be satisfactory.  If the people engaged in the export of dogs were subject to the same export regulations as other sectors that might be another way to enforce rules and regulations and allow inspections to ensure that the dogs have been treated properly.  Breeders would also require licences and this would help ensure the proper treatment of animals.Many emotions have been raised on all sides about this Bill.   There is an implication on one side that breeding and selling dogs for profit is immoral.  Unfortunately, as with every other domestic or farm animal in this country, the reason most of them exist is that someone breeds and sells them to make money.  Other people buy those dogs because they want them as pets or for racing or coursing.  The relationship between human and dog is not equal.  That is a fact of life and people have to accept it.  The issue then is to ensure that those animals are treated well.There is also an undoubted hostility on the part of many people to greyhound coursing, racing and indeed to horse racing.  People are obviously entitled to their views, but the claim made that there is an agenda ultimately to ban a wide range of sports including those I referred to are not too wide of the mark.  There are people who see this legislation and the stag hunting ban as part of that agenda and there is no doubt that they will pressure the Minister to extend bans to other sports involving animals.  I am not sure whether the Minister subscribes to that agenda but it is clear that his party is identified with an anti-rural sports lobby.  In a situation where the Green Party has demonstrated itself to be unwilling or unable to restrain current right-wing economic policies, it makes political sense for the party to attempt to deliver something substantial to its ideological constituency.There was also a belief among people involved in the greyhound sector that this Bill, if it was extended to greyhound owners and breeders, was a backdoor way to damage the sector.  Let there be no mistake about it.  Legislation to ban coursing or track racing would clearly not be acceptable to Sinn Féin.  The case for the exclusion of the greyhound sector has been well made, and it obviously made an impact politically and perhaps on the Minister's approach to the legislation.Greyhound enthusiasts have a legitimate case on the grounds that if the Bill as initially drafted was applied to them, it would mean that they would be subject to a further layer of regulation, fees and inspections, given that their greyhounds are already registered and identified through the Irish Coursing Club and that the sector enforces a rigorous set of criteria on all aspects of the keeping, breeding, identification and use of greyhounds in coursing and on the track.There is also an issue with the level of fees being charged.  It has been argued that these are too high.  If the amount of money collected after the first year shows a surplus, as was the case with the Taxi Regulator, then perhaps the fees could be reduced in line with that surplus.  The fees should only cover the costs of administration rather than being seen as another revenue gathering exercise.There has also been some disquiet over who exactly conducts inspections.  No legitimate breeder objects to inspections to ensure that dogs are being properly cared for.  However, those inspections should only be carried out by certified vets attached either to the local authority or the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I was encouraged by certain aspects of the Minister's statement which alluded to that.It has also been suggested that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food could compile a register of breeding establishments and conduct regular inspections to ensure compliance.  That procedure is followed in other countries where annual fees are much lower than those proposed here, and which cover the administrative costs of inspections and so on.  Given the importance of the breeding of dogs for commercial export, it would place the sector on the same level as the breeding and sale of other animals.I know that the Minister met with people in the North about the concept of animal welfare legislation being introduced on both sides of the Border.  There should be a convergence of legislation to the greatest extent possible, and that applies to this issue as much as to any other.  We all recall the success of the cross-Border approach that was taken in recent years to the foot and mouth crisis and the more recent crisis with contaminated pig feed.  Common sense alone would dictate that where animals can be moved over a land border, it is important that those with ulterior motives should not be able to do so in order to avoid sanctions in one jurisdiction that do not apply in another.  It is unfortunate that more cognisance was not taken of the animal welfare legislation currently going through Stormont.  The Government here might have drafted a more comprehensive Bill rather than concentrating for political reasons on particular sectors such as hunting and greyhounds.  For example, the Northern Ireland Bill specifically outlines cruelty offences, including the use of dogs for fighting, that would allow the prosecution of people involved in such practices.  It also proposes to make it an offence to abandon animals, which seems to happen in certain cases where people dump unwanted or old animals.There are other issues including some to which I have referred that need to be addressed through further amendments.  I hope that the suggested changes will be accepted when we return to this next week.  I am encouraged that the Minister and his officials have engaged with the Irish Greyhound Board to reassure its members about their concerns with the Bill.  I am also encouraged by the Minister's commitment that he intends to introduce amendments to that effect on Committee Stage.We in Sinn Féin abhor any cruelty to animals and the misuse or mistreatment of animals, and we want to approach this Bill positively.  Until such time as we see the amendments, we will be reserving our judgment.  We have concerns and we will be tabling amendments about which we feel very strongly.  Hopefully the Minister will be able to incorporate them into the Bill and we might have consensus across the House.  I will await the outcome.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.  The Bill is a necessary piece of legislation.  Unfortunately, we have all seen on our screens the severe cruelty inflicted on dogs on so-called puppy farms and this Bill will ensure that Ireland will no longer be a haven for unscrupulous breeders.  In 2008, over 10,000 stray or unwanted dogs were put to sleep in Ireland's dog pounds.  Ireland currently does not have the standards in place that are present in other countries, thus ensuring that unscrupulous breeders are able to take full advantage of our existing controls.Breeding establishments are currently inspected by dog wardens and county vets from the local councils.  In most instances a good job is done, but unfortunately there are problems.  We need new guidelines to protect our dogs and our puppies.  The number of dogs destroyed each year is totally abhorrent.  We must put an end to the abuse of animals for profit.This Bill was drafted in accordance with the recommendations of the working group to review the management of dog breeding establishments which reported in June 2005.  A dog breeding establishment is defined in the bill as a premises with no fewer than six bitches of four months old capable of breeding.  The limit of no fewer than six bitches will exclude the vast majority of cases where people rear dogs as pets.In order to obtain a broad range of views on the issue, the working group was comprised of representatives from a number of bodies, including the Veterinary Council of Ireland, the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Kennel Club, the Dog Breeders Association of Ireland and the ISPCA.  Interested members of the public were invited to make submissions to the group by way of a notice in the national press on the 4 October 2004, thus ensuring that the process was not restrictive.This Bill is about bringing laws in Ireland in line with international best practice.  It will be good for Ireland's international image and will protect the welfare of dogs.  It has been alleged that the legislation is part of a greater anti-countryside conspiracy.  My contention is that barbaric animal cruelty demands legislation.  The purpose of the Bill is to safeguard the health and welfare of dogs.  People are seriously concerned about the inhumane cruelty that has been perpetrated.  This is a national concern and it is not confined to rural Ireland.I want to put on record my own personal experience.  Having spent a life time supporting two local hunt clubs on my doorstep, I cannot speak highly enough of the care these clubs provide for their animals.  Hunting has a long tradition in my area.  I have visited these local kennels many times and like many rural supporters over the years, I have watched with great delight and pride as these fine dogs set out on their day's hunt.There are amendments needed to this Bill.  In consultation with local clubs, I am seeking changes.  Imposing extra costs on hunts and thereby putting jobs at risks in the current circumstances is not acceptable.  Kennelling is an example.  Hounds hunt as a pack because they are pack animals.  It is not realistic to insist that they are individually kennelled.  I would go so far as to say that this will cause chaos among hounds when they then come together in a hunting situation.As hunt kennels are not commercial operations, they have little option to improve their income.  Hounds can be swopped but not sold.  Local kennels provide a necessary service not only in removing dead animals from farms but in taking away a dead cat or dog from a household or when one is found dead on a local road or street.  On behalf of hunt kennels, I am seeking further amendments, in accordance with commitments given, and I appeal for a full exemption of hunt kennels registered with the Hunting Association of Ireland.There is a provision for an increase in the cost of individual dog licences.  The cost of an individual dog licence has not been increased since 1998.   More than 215,000  licences were issued in 2008, providing an income of €2.8 million to local authorities.  However, the administration costs for this were €5.7 million, representing a shortfall of €2.9 million.Breeding establishments are defined as having six or more entire bitches; those with fewer will not be included in the proposed legislation.  Small breeders will not be affected by the legislation.  A well run breeding facility has nothing to fear from the new proposals.Some dog breeders have expressed fears that the dog breeding legislation will be enforced by unqualified animal welfare workers.  It will be members of the Local Authority Veterinary Service, a professional body comprising of what may be termed "Government vets", who will oversee fair and reasonable implementation of the Bill.The intensive dog breeding industry has acknowledged that approximately 90,000 puppies are bred annually of which 45,000 are exported overseas, primarily to the United Kingdom.  This trade in puppies is valued at €29 million.  Permanent identification of these pups before they leave the premises is essential in order to identify the origin of the puppy.Up to now the issue of dog control has been governed by the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to 1991.  This legislation seems to have worked effectively but clearly needs updating in regard to regulations dealing with dog breeding establishments.The provisions of this Bill will not hold any fear for those who run their establishments well and who have established quality premises and practices in co-operation with their local veterinary practices.  I am also concerned about the extra costs to local hunt clubs that would apply under this legislation.  It is a requirement of the proposed legislation that each dog in a dog breeding establishment be microchipped.  This provision builds on existing practice, whereby a dog that is registered with a dog breeders' association or a breed association is generally microchipped for the purpose of registration and verifying bloodlines.The Bill will hopefully put an end to backstreet dog-breeders and will benefit commercial breeders who do a good job and treat their animals humanely. It will protect dogs in our breeding establishments, whether they are bred for sale as pets or for racing and will improve the reputation of the Irish dog breeding industry.Concerns were expressed over the implications for greyhound breeders, trainers and the many people employed in the industry.  This is another area where my colleagues and I have sought amendments.  Regulation of the greyhound industry should be made through amendments to the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  I welcome that the Minister has asked the Minister, Deputy Smith, to do this.I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to make the amendments necessary that will ensure that this Bill fits the purpose for which it is before the House.  That is to bring an end to the cruelty perpetrated on dogs on so called puppy farms.I have no problem with what is proposed applying to commercial for profit establishments but it should not apply to not for profit organisations such as the greyhound association and the Hunting Association of Ireland.  Animal welfare is a number one priority for these people.  If the Minister wanted to visit some of the hunting kennels or greyhound establishments, I would arrange for him do so and I would welcome that.  I hope that the proposed amendments to the Bill will be to the satisfaction of everyone concerned.
#NedOKeeffe	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-party	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I am pleased to speak on this Bill.  Last week was an historic one in this House, having regard to the confusion that arose between the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill and the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill.  I have never seen such confusion, with people failing to understand the difference between the two Bills.  The confusion continued and the abuse we got in telephone call and e-mails was rough going.  It was one of my toughest weeks in this House and it was due to confusion.  In future when Bills of this nature are going through the House — the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill is different from the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill — they should be dealt with at separate times because people did not understand what these Bills were about.  We heard they would bring about a ban on hare coursing and on live cattle exports — I never heard anything like it.  I want to clearly make that point.We have been in Government with the Green Party and  I have enjoyed our term to date.  The Green Party has done well under this Government.  It is entitled to introduce its fair share of legislation and to have its fair crack of the whip in this respect.  It has put through difficult legislation for my party and Government on banking, NAMA and many other areas.  It was unfair of a small minority of people to make an attack on that party.  I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, is here; he is an exceptional Minister.  The Green Party has a different ideology from my party but, by and large, we work well.  I look forward to my party finishing up with the Green Party in Government in probably two years' time and to our going to the country and perhaps being successful again.The Dog Breeding Establishments Bill deals with regulating puppy farms and it long overdue.  I am aware of a puppy farm where the pups were kept in deplorable conditions, they are subject to cruelty and live in squalor, the likes of which I had never seen.  While I did not understand much about this area, anyone who is an animal lover — all rural people, by and large, are animal lovers — would be appalled by the conditions on that farm.A former Minister, Deputy Roche, took this matter in hand, for which he has been admired, but he has moved from the Department before seeing the legislation introduced.  The proposed legislation was inherited by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and well done to him for introducing it.During my almost 30 years as a Member of this House, some legislation has been introduced that has been offensive to animal lovers and to people involved in hunting.  When the legislation providing for the muzzling of greyhounds was introduced, we thought the roof of the Chamber would come in on top of us, but the industry has thrived since its introduction and the coursing industry has also been very successful.  People are always nervous of change but often change can be for the better.  The coursing industry has become very valuable to the economy.I fought a vigorous campaign in 1988 with the then Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, and the then Minister, Padraig Flynn.  Otter hunting occurred in only a small part country, mainly in north Cork on the River Bride and the River Funshion, which are tributaries of the River Blackwater.  Otter hunting was banned and there were massive rows about it.  I defended otter hunting as best I could at the time.  I fought a hard battle on that with the then Minister, Padraig Flynn, and the then Taoiseach.  The proposed legislation to ban otter hunting has originated from Europe and its introduction would have affected my area.  We heard from the otter packs and specialist dog people, to whom Deputy Johnny Brady referred.  They are still there but they do not hunt otter any more.Wild mink have now taken over on the River Funshion and the River Bride and they are destroying the fish stock and water birds such as water hens and cormorants, which is the one regret I have about the banning of otter hunting.  That did not happen when there was otter hunting because the people who were interested in such hunting maintained a discipline on the river and they also protected the otter species.  They were animal lovers and even though they hunted otters they looked after them.  I have land along the banks of the River Funshion and there are otters on that river bank but they are not cared for anymore.  The river can flood and many things can happen along the river bank but there is no one to look after the otters.  Those people cared for the otters even though they were wild animals.  A danger in introducing animal welfare legislation is that the people who are involved in animal welfare do not have the same commitment to protecting wild species as the people to whom I referred.Bord na gCon is a State agency and the chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is well aware of my views on that agency.  It has stepped over the line.  If Charlie Haughey, Jack Lynch or Liam Cosgrave were here, there would be a new board because of its behaviour.  Members of this House, whether in Government or in Opposition, make policy and we look after the spending of the Exchequer funding, but when people from State agencies — for which this House is responsible — appearing before a committee come into a meeting tell me what to do, I take a serious view of such behaviour.  I was shocked and appalled when people from  Bord na gCon appearing before the committee in question, came in to talk about the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill and spent a considerable time doing so.I told the delegate from Bord na gCon that that was my job, not his.  The board stepped well over the line in its behaviour.  I have seen State boards over the years dismissed and reappointed by Governments, and I am worried about the behaviour of this one.  Its job is to look after the greyhound track industry.  It has spoken about an estimate for the future, but I have strong reservations about its behaviour.  It is also in conflict with the coursing industry because it does not want greyhounds racing in ordinary fields, whether in open coursing or park meetings.  It should be funding the coursing industry but the problem is the stud book; the coursing industry controls the stud book and Bord na gCon wants to lay its hands on it.  We have the same problem with draft horses because the sports horse industry wants to take over that stud book.  The battle goes on between the ordinary people and the specialists.  There is snobbery in the industry.I am also concerned by Bord na gCon's expenditure, with €23 million spent on a race track at Markets Field in Limerick.  State resources are being used to build a large glasshouse at a time when we are stretched dealing with Anglo Irish Bank and other issues.  That amount of money would be better spent in the interests of social welfare recipients and users of the public health system.  The money is already committed but it should have been reviewed two years ago when the country was on the eve of a crisis.  I know the Markets Field in Limerick as well as anybody here.  As a boy of ten or 11 years of age, I sold calves in that field.  It was a valuable market at that time in the west, with herefords — or whiteheads, as they were known — being bought and sold in April and May.  As I said, Bord na gCon has gone over the top in its behaviour.  It should not be in the business of corporate entertainment; its job is to look after the greyhound industry, not to be grilling steaks and cooking chickens and ducks.It is certainly time for the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to be updated.  It has served its purpose well but it has been in place for more than 50 years.  Much of this legislation crosses over between agriculture and the environment.  I welcome that we have found a way to take greyhounds out of this legislation by making necessary changes to the 1958 Act.  I do not understand the strong opposition that exists to micro-chipping.  Deputy Bannon spoke earlier about swine, bovines and so on.  It ultimately comes down to the fact that people do not like change.  Just as tagging, recording and inspections have been introduced at farm level in the bovine industry, the other industries will have to accept it too.I do not want to boast about my own area, but I am fairly certain we have the largest number of park meetings of coursings in the country.  We also have a greyhound track in our constituency.  We have the famous Duhallow Hounds, the Avondhu, and the Coolnakilla Harriers which is a very famous harrier organisation that has won national prizes.  The latter is very controlled and disciplined in its activities.  We also have Ballymacoda, a famous place for open coursing.  In defence of these and other organisations, I say there is noting to fear from this legislation.  However, it is inevitable that somebody will abuse the system.Dog licensing is very welcome given that dog fighting is becoming such a problem.  People are keeping dogs larger than calves in many housing estates, with neighbours living in fear.  We must clamp down on that because it is encouraging dog fighting.  I will not name the areas where these dangerous dogs are most often found because that would be unfair to residents, but it seems to be a particular problem in new housing estates.  These dogs are a threat to society and to human beings.  I am holding clinics tomorrow in a particular area and an urban councillor there has promised to take me into a housing estate to show me what is happening.  Local authority representatives in these areas are constantly receiving complaints.I thank the Minister, Deputy Ryan, for taking this debate.  His party and mine are partners in government and I work well with him and his colleagues.  I have no criticisms to make of his party.  Some of the criticism of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has been grossly unfair.  I have never had a problem meeting the Minister, and he was quite willing to meet with deputations I have brought to him.  I am probably seen by some as one of the more awkward people in this House, although perhaps I am not so bad, but the Minister has always been willing to meet me and discuss my concerns.  I say well done to him and I look forward to meeting him down in Duhallow.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I listened carefully to the contribution by the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  This issue has been debated extensively outside the House in recent weeks.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad where it was discussed for months, yet it is to be railroaded through the Lower House in less than one day.  We can only take what the Minister has said in good faith.  We heard from him today that the greyhound industry has a summer reprieve, but that is not good enough.  The Minister must indicate clearly the amendments he proposes to introduce and the impact they will have on the greyhound industry in particular.  What he has done today is to kick the matter to touch.  He has effectively told the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, that if he does not do X, Y and Z, namely, implement the changes the Minister, Deputy Gormley, requires in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, that he will not sign this legislation into law.  That is not good Government.  Once again we see the cohesion of the arrangement between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party breaking down.I come from a family that is involved in breeding and racing greyhounds.  One of my earliest memories is of travelling to a trial in Milltown Malbay with my father, with two greyhounds in the back of the car.  I currently have a bitch called Taco Beauty.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Five or six of us own that bitch between us and she has won races both on the track and in the field, in Liscannor and in the Duffer Stakes.  She has produced very good pups, one of which won two rounds of the Produce Stakes, which is a classic, and was trained by an excellent trainer, Gerry Holian.  I come from a tradition in Clarecastle where we won two coursing derbies with Murty's Gang and Danagher's Best.  It horrified me to see Senator Ó Brolcháin talking about an issue he knew nothing about.  He talked about The Late Late Show commanding stud fees of up to €1 million.  In all fairness, if he was a stallion that might be the case, but The Late Late Show commands a stud fee of €800.  For any Green Party spokesman to lecture Fine Gael Senators in that way is ridiculous.What impact will this legislation have on the greyhound industry?  The idea that a breeding bitch is classified at six months is laughable.  Not every bitch is bred; only select bitches are bred if they have proven themselves, or perhaps if they are from a good litter.  They certainly are not classified as brood bitches at six months.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government proposes to change that from four months to six months.  It is ridiculous.  It is so stupid it shows a complete lack of understanding and ignorance of the whole issue.It would be funny if we were not talking about an industry that supports 11,000 jobs.  To the credit of successive Fianna Fáil Governments, first class stadia have been built and one is currently under construction.  All of that will be undermined if we start tampering with the greyhound industry.  I did not hear anything from the Minister that got me excited.  The greyhound industry has a reprieve for the summer but we are still in the dark because we have not seen the amendments.  I will reserve my judgment on this legislation until I see the amendments in black and white.I have no difficulty with the regulation of puppy farms but I question how many puppy farms there actually are in the country.  The Minister is making more of an issue of this than it is.  I am horrified to see images on television of intensive puppy breeding — it is wrong — but the Minister should not tar the greyhound industry with that brush.  I was horrified that the Minister never mentioned the Irish Coursing Club in his speech.  That was outrageous.I hope the Minister will see sense.  I appeal to Fianna Fáil, Green Party and Independent Deputies to make sure the amendments to the 1958 Act are reasonable, that they take account of what matters in the greyhound industry and that they are not pie in the sky.  The current Bill's provisions for the greyhound industry are pie in the sky.  The proposed fees of €400 and €250 are ridiculous.  They will cripple an indigenous industry that already has a fee structure in place.  If someone wants to register a litter or transfer ownership, there are regulations in place.  There is no need to interfere with them because they are fair and have worked for years.The best way to deal with this issue is through the 1958 Act.  We must see the amendments that will supposedly come.  I am not happy with the way this legislation is being rushed through the House and I look forward to scrutinising the amendments on Committee and Report Stages.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Like my colleague, Deputy Carey, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Pardon the pun, but with unemployment levels and ordinary families struggling to make ends meets, it is not surprising that ordinary people out in the street think that the Government has finally gone to the dogs.I tried to go through the Minister's speech but it is only a face-saving exercise for the Fianna Fáil backbenchers so the Government can survive this session.  The desperate last minute haggling between both parties will not quell the deep anger in rural areas.  The Minister is trying to buy time but what happens if the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food do not bring in the same regulations?  The greyhound industry will be back to square one.If a stay is being put on the Bill until 1 January, why guillotine it?  Deputies should have more time to speak on this Bill because it is important in rural Ireland.  Last week, Deputy O'Rourke in her contribution on the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill warned the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that there were to be no more ramblings into rural Ireland.  This was echoed by the crowds of people who gathered outside the front gates of Leinster House to express real anger at the Green Party.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is a man I respect but this anger was echoed in the Red C poll last weekend, with another fall in support for the Green Party.People in rural areas are concerned about what is happening.  My office has been inundated with calls about this and the way life in rural areas is being changed.  Traditions that were part and parcel of rural life are under attack, including the age old tradition of turf cutting; many country families cut turf on their own land and depend on it for fuel.  If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government continues to whip his Fianna Fáil colleagues into submission, turf cutting will be consigned to the annals of history.I commend the work by dog control wardens in local authorities and welcome that aspect of the Bill.  Mr. Frankie Coote looks after the situation in County Clare, picking up abandoned dogs, and regulation is necessary.It is important the Government takes on board the views of the Opposition.  We should all be singing from the same hymn sheet.  There can be a compromise with the amendments.  Sustaining rural Ireland and its traditions is important.  We should not threaten people's livelihoods and the Government should turn its attention to the problem of rural isolation.Sporting and angling are vital to the rural economy.  This debate and the debate last week should not have been a debate on rural Ireland versus urban Ireland; that has to stop.  As many other speakers have said, the greyhound industry contributes a huge amount of money to the economy.  It generates approximately €500 million and supports the huge amount of approximately 11,000 jobs.  We all know people in every parish in every county who take great pride in their greyhounds and Clare is no different.  Many of the dog breeders there go to the greyhound tracks in Limerick or Galway every Friday and Saturday night and they look forward to that social event.  Greyhound racing and coursing are extremely important, particularly the annual meetings in places such as Cooraclare, Killimer, Kilmihill and Clarecastle and Ennistymon, to name but a few.  The event in Liscannor is also extremely important.  The events are important for local villages and towns.Many people are involved in coursing clubs, such as the Tradaree Coursing Club.  They want to have a dog who will raise a flag and win a race in Clonmel or wherever.  Of those involved in greyhound breeding, 90% are small operators and under this legislation they will only be able to breed a brood bitch every 12 months.  One does not see a greyhound's potential until it is approximately a year and half old.  This afternoon, a breeder told me that changing the threshold to six bitches will make no difference to greyhound owners.The greyhound industry is self-regulated to a very high standard and that is important.  I visited the kennels of the County Clare Hunt, which are located in my parish of Drumquin.  They are very clean establishments and the dogs are looked after extremely well.  An odd time I hear the hounds when they go for a walk.Many owners are concerned about the mechanism that will be put into place to force the greyhound industry into double regulation which is part and parcel of the Bill.  They are not convinced that they will not be wiped out and that they will still be forced to pay.  Up until now, a small breeder could manage to come up with €20 or €30 along the way so they could stay involved in the sport.  For many people having a dog is just a hobby.  The Minister stated that €400 is not excessive, but for many people €400 is a lot of money, particularly in these recessionary times.  Added to that are veterinary inspection fees.  The fear is that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will put in place a similar regulatory system.I welcome electronic microchipping for dogs.  It is a good aspect of the Bill and is very important for tracing lost dogs and with regard to where dogs are bred.  As Deputy Hogan stated, Fine Gael supports stronger rules on puppy farms.  Whatever legislation we introduce it will be very difficult to track people down because many people ignore the law anyway.  There is no doubt that regulation is needed.  We have all seen many published incidents of abuse of dogs, the terror some dogs have to go through and dogs that are kept in really bad conditions.  This needs to be regulated and all parties in the House agree on that.  Even with amendments, many in the greyhound industry throughout the country believe the industry will be strangled and that is why it is important that there is all-party agreement.I hope the Fianna Fáil backbenchers will not be subject to the Whip again in this debate and abandon rural constituencies.  The Government has lost the trust of rural Ireland and they will see this when the election is called and they go knocking on doors.  Rural Ireland has been ignored for far too long and people have had enough.  The former US President, Andrew Jackson, said, "One man with courage makes a majority".  I hope there is much courage among our colleagues in the Fianna Fáil backbenches and that they stand up for rural Ireland.  We have to wait and see the amendments the Minister will bring on board.  I hope the Minister will accept the amendments of the Opposition parties and listen to rural Ireland.  This legislation is needed but there needs to be all-party agreement on it.

It has exercised many Deputies over recent weeks, Fianna Fáil Deputies as well as Deputies on the other side of the House.  In 2005, Deputy Dick Roche prepared the heads of the Bill with regard to a report for the working group.  At that time, it was to deal specifically with puppy farms.  Unfortunately, Deputy Roche did not stay long enough in the Department to finalise the Bill and now, not alone does it cover puppy farms but also kennels, greyhounds and every other sector of the dog community involved.  It has caused much soul searching and public anger throughout the country.  All of us as Deputies were subject to representations from the greyhound industry, the kennel industry and from other areas of the dog sector.Last weekend, 300 or 400 people from Wexford visited me at my clinics, informing me they were not too happy about what is in the Bill and asking me to make representations to the Minister and to the Government.  The Minister has reacted to some of the representations.  We will await the amendments to be tabled and perhaps we will table more amendments between now and next Thursday to ensure the people in rural Ireland will be satisfied with the Bill when it is finally enacted.It is always difficult to fully satisfy people but I am sure we will go part of the way in satisfying them.  I have no problem with the legislation on puppy farms.  The low standards set by unscrupulous dog breeders throughout the country in recent years has left much to be desired.  Not all breeders are out of order because we have many good dog breeders that produce top-class quality and run very good operations.  However, there are some cowboy operators that need to be dealt with.  In 2005, the working group made strong recommendations in this area.  The purpose of the Bill should be to safeguard dogs, particularly those in puppy farms.  We should have proper identification, proper traceability and proper regulations, and people who run puppy farms properly and within the law have nothing to fear in the Bill.Hunting clubs have raised many issues with me in recent weeks and, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows, Wexford has the Bree Hunt, the Island Hunt, the Wexford Hunt and Killinick Harriers.  They have huge membership from dog owners to horse owners and they run very good kennels.  To impose charges on them would cause severe hardship.  They are not for profit organisations.  It has enjoyable outings.  It does a lot of fundraising for charitable purposes and provides valuable employment, directly and indirectly, if one considers what is involved in looking after the hounds and those involved in the hunts on a weekly basis throughout the season.  A lot of people are employed and involved and it is also an opportunity to showcase its horses.  It is very dissatisfied with the overall thrust of the Bill.The Minister said he will table amendments on Committee Stage and I hope he will go further with amendments that will appease those who operate kennels and hunt clubs around the country.  In his speech he stated that having regard to the concerns of the Hunting Association of Ireland, HAI, and the Irish Greyhound Board he has agreed registration fee exemptions for HAI registered members and greyhound trainers.  He has also agreed to widen the fee bands in order that a dog breeding establishment with six to 18 bitches over six months of age which are capable of breeding will pay a fee of €400.  He reiterated that someone with fewer than six breeding bitches will not be covered by the Bill.  It is a welcome change from the Minister's initial proposal.  In some areas the €400 will cause hardships and the Minister needs to reconsider the issue to see how he can make further changes.He is also allowing for the continuation of the tattooing of dogs in dog breeding establishments operated by hunt clubs as an alternative option to microchipping.  Hunt clubs sought such a provision and I welcome that the Minister will do that.  It is a welcome change.  I am sure the kennel clubs will not have only problem with the addition of a subsection to section 15 to require that tattoos be registered on a database for traceability purposes.Dog wardens generally do a good job but the problem is that we have only one dog warden in each county and their job is difficult when one considers more than 10,000 dogs are put down every year.  I welcome the fact that the Minister proposed having a dog licence for the lifetime of the dog rather than having to renew it on a yearly basis.  In his speech the Minister said he would seriously consider an exemption for dog licences for old age pensioners.On the greyhound industry, like Deputy Carey I own a greyhound.  It ran six times and was last five times.  It is not as successful as Deputy Carey's greyhound.  It is costing me a lot of money to keep it and train it, although the trainer feels I am in arrears on training fees.  We do not want to over regulate the greyhound industry.  The industry worked very well under the 1958 Act.  It has been one of the great success stories of this country.  Different Governments have invested in it, including the Fine Gael and Labour coalition and the current Government, which has pumped a lot of money into the greyhound industry.  New stadia are being built around the country.There is a dog track in Enniscorthy which is one of the most successful in the country.  People tell me it is the top betting dog track in Ireland.  Unfortunately we did not have the same investment as other parts of the country.  The former Minister, Joe Walsh, allocated €4 million to it a number of years ago for but for reasons I cannot go into today we were unable to avail of it.  It is not the same standard as others with restaurants.  It is a very high class greyhound track for racing.In recent years due to the recession we have seen a downturn in the greyhound industry.  During the boom farmers and builders were doing well and there was huge investment in greyhounds, not just in Wexford but all over the country.  In 2006 Ireland produced 4,481 litters of greyhounds.  It has decreased by 14%, 6%, 11% and there is a 9% decrease projected for this year.  For the first time in a decade Ireland will produce fewer than 3,000 litters in 2010.  Based on the numbers of declared litters in 2010 so far, we are on course to produce some 2,800 litters this year which compared to 2006 is a drop of one third.We do not want to introduce legislation which will downgrade the greyhound industry and will lead to a lack of investment.  The 1958 Act has worked very well and I complement the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, on the changes announced today.  The Minister, Deputy Smith, will upgrade the 1958 Act in the autumn in line with this Bill.  I appeal to both Ministers not to over-regulate the greyhound industry.  It currently works very well.  It should be left alone.  There is no need for changes.I have great faith in the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister, Deputy Smith, to work out a system that will ensure that the greyhound industry will continue to thrive and be viable, and will encourage people invest in the greyhound industry in Ireland.

Deputy Joe Carey has left the House but I would like to congratulate him on his elevation to the position of deputy Chief Whip of Fine Gael.  I was interested in his comments on the greyhound industry because he is obviously very knowledgeable about it, as is Deputy Browne.  It appears as if Deputy Carey is more successful.  Deputy Browne had a dog that was last five times out of six.  I hope Deputy Carey is successful and that his bitch has a very good litter.This Bill prompted a huge amount of discussion outside the House before it came before the House.  In rural Ireland we have been inundated with people calling to us with their views on the Bill.  Like Deputy Browne, a huge number of people came to see me last weekend about the measures in the Bill.  We have been trying to force change and it is to be hoped that we are moving towards a compromise and something with which we can all live and agree.  The Bill has a very worthy objective because there is no doubt there is a huge problem in the country in the way puppy farms are currently run.  We have seen a number of television programmes on the abuses and cruelty in the industry.  There have also been reports in the press on it.  Any right thinking person in the country would say that this was going to be an excellent Bill to deal with this aspect of society.  It would have had universal support in this House.As the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said a number of years ago, the primary objective was to regulate commercial dog breeding but unfortunately it went beyond that.  It has included the greyhound industry and the hunting community.  The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, was referred to.  When he was dealing with the Bill he said in dealing with HAI that it was not part of the problem, therefore it did not have to be part of the solution.  That is true, it is not part of the problem.I wonder why so much controversy had to be created.  The waters were muddied by making it a catch-all Bill rather than dealing with the real problem.  It is unfortunate that all of that has happened.  In doing that we brought about a situation which, it is to be hoped, will not arise as a result of some of the comments the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said earlier today.  The Bill could be defeated when we vote on it next Thursday, which would be a pity when we are trying to deal with commercial puppy farming and not extraneous elements that were brought in.The local hunt in Waterford is the Woodstown Harriers.  I have seen how well it runs its operation, as do the other hunts throughout the country.  I visited it, saw its kennels and how it looks after its animals.  Some of them are looked after better than some human beings.The suggestion that hunting organisations or greyhound owners are mistreating animals is very wide of the mark.  Rogue operators pop up in every walk of life but, by and large, these organisations run a good show.The Minister had indicated that affiliates of the Hunting Association of Ireland, HAI, would be exempted from the legislation and, as such, they were not included in the consultative process.  However, it subsequently transpired that they would be affected by the Bill even though they did not have a proper opportunity to make their views known.  My colleagues and I told our constituents in good faith that we had the Minister's assurance that the legislation would not affect them and it is difficult to maintain our credibility if we have to admit we were wrong or that the goalposts have moved.The greyhound industry is well regulated by the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, and the Irish Coursing Club, ICC.  The ICC operates a register of all matings, litters born, adult greyhounds named and transfers of ownership.  All stud dogs and brood bitches are DNA profiled, greyhounds are tattooed and earmarked for identification purposes and pups are inspected and tattooed by control stewards jointly appointed by the ICC and the IGB.  Greyhound breeders are subject to registration fees which ultimately support the integrity of the industry.  Recent reductions in funding for the industry have been accompanied by decreases in prize money which will impact on breeding and future supply of greyhounds.  The industry has a defined policing structure on all matters relating to conduct of breeders and owners.  Matters deemed to be in breach of industry regulations are processed through the independent control committee for sanction.I am dealing with the Bill as it stands even though the Minister has indicated his intention to bring amendments because I have not had an opportunity to study his contribution on Second Stage.  He has indicated that the greyhound industry will continue to be regulated by amendments to the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.  Does this mean the industry will be covered by this legislation until such time as new legislation is enacted or will it be exempted altogether?I met several representatives of the greyhound industry in my clinic in Waterford.  I am closely acquainted with some of these individuals and I greatly respect their judgment.  They expressed concern that the six litter ban would eventually kill the industry in this country because only the best brood bitches have more than six litters.  If this measure comes into force, many of these bitches will be exported to France and elsewhere.  The effects will not be felt for two or three years but the industry will then begin to die.  I do not see why it would not suffice to allow a vet to determine whether a bitch is able to have more than six litters.The Kilcohan Park Greyhound Stadium in Waterford has attracted huge numbers of spectators thanks to its excellent facilities.  I do not want the contribution it makes to the local economy to be damaged in any way.I wonder how "breeding bitch" will be defined.  A dog breeding establishment is defined as owning more than six breeding bitches.  However, a bitch may not be used for breeding again if her first litter is not good enough and, while she is a bitch, she is not a breeding bitch.Significant progress has been made on the inspection regime.  A dog warden can make a report but it will be up to the local authority veterinary inspector to make the follow-up inspection, possibly accompanied by representatives from the relevant organisation.  I welcome the Minister's announcement on fee exemptions for the HAI, IGB and ICC.  Let us hope that by the time we vote on the Bill next Thursday we will have agreed legislation with which all of us can live.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.  When the Bill was introduced I understood that its purpose was to regulate puppy farms, which I would completely support because I have seen on television the abuse that animals in some of these establishments suffer.  For quite some time my party has pushed for stronger rules on puppy farms.  However, the Bill before the House goes far beyond the issue of puppy farms to impose additional costs and duplicate inspection structures on rural industries such as greyhound and hunting dog breeding.These are important activities in my constituency.  Greyhound breeding has been popular in County Limerick for hundreds of years.  People of the area love their sport and sometimes treat their dogs better than they would treat themselves.  Rather than introduce something that inhibits the development of this industry, we want supportive policies that create jobs and opportunities.Fox hunting is also popular in County Limerick.  Several packs are based in the county, the most famous of which is the Black and Tans pack in Emly.  The soldiers known as the black and tans got their name from this pack.  The name of the pack in turn comes from the black and tan colour of foxhounds.  The County Limerick Foxhounds pack is based two miles from where I live.  As a child I was entertained when the horses and hounds walked up the road on which I grew up.  We also helped to rear the pack's pups, which were farmed out to various families.  There was a lot of angst among children in the area when dogs reached maturity and had to be returned to Clonshire.  We had great days at the puppy shows, when all the new pups were judged.Prizes were given, children were given lemonade — there was no cola at that time — sweets, buns and God knows what else.  It was part of our life.  We also have foxhunting, scarteens and many other packs.The Fine Gael Party proposed a number of amendments in the Seanad to exclude these vital industries and instead focus primarily on puppy farms.  While the Minister indicated he will partially reconsider the issue, the Bill before us is unchanged from the legislation passed in the Seanad.  Fianna Fáil Party backbench Deputies have correctly expressed their opposition to the proposals, which are an excuse for the Green Party to impose its narrow ideological agenda on rural Ireland under the guise of solving other, real problems.  There is no reference to dog breeding legislation or more regulation on industries such as greyhound racing in the revised programme for Government.  Backbench Government Deputies will argue that they were unaware that the promised legislation on puppy farms included the areas to which I have referred.While the Fine Gael Party is happy to engage with the Government and other stakeholders to address the issue of puppy farms, it will not do so while the Green Party is threatening to undermine rural industries which provide real jobs and income.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is a more appropriate public body to have responsibility for animal welfare, with operational responsibility devolved to other bodies.Under the proposal announced by the Minister, the regulation on greyhound control will be suspended to allow the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to examine this area and produce proposals on the 1958 law.  If the Green Party is not satisfied with the Minister's proposals, it can choose not to accept them because the decision will be made at Cabinet.  If the Minister has not introduced an agreed regulation by 1 January next, the current proposals will be signed.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has problems with the proposals, he can be overruled without reference to the House and Deputies will not be given an opportunity to express a view on the changes taking place.  If the Green Party wants to ensure the proposals before us are introduced, it need only refuse to approve any proposal made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.The proposed change merely postpones the evil day.  Why not trust the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to do what is right in the area of animal welfare given the Department's long and illustrious experience, if that is the correct term, in dealing with the welfare of all animals under many regulations and Acts?  The Department can be trusted to regulate the welfare of animals.Hunt clubs are not commercial bodies and hunting beagles are not bred for sale or racing but to replace hounds in the pack.  The greyhound industry is highly regulated and tightly controlled by the l958 Act.  Why interfere with a system that works?The proposed powers to access premises are draconian and raise a question as to whether they undermine property rights under the Constitution.  The Minister has gone over the top on puppy farms by applying its provisions to hunting beagles and greyhounds.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	While I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, it is extraordinary that Dáil Éireann should sit on a Friday to deal with such legislation when the Government cannot provide time to discuss serious health issues, the 40% drop in farm income, the extraordinary economic problems that many mortgage holders are experiencing and, especially, the cutbacks in support for those who are elderly or disabled.  Only last Wednesday, the Taoiseach promised we would be given advice on Thursday morning as to how people with cystic fibrosis would be dealt with.  I understand some time will be provided for this matter next week but no time could be found for the Dáil to deal with any of the other issues to which I referred.  For the Green Party, the life of a deer or the position of dogs is clearly much more serious than the real problems of real people.As a farmer, I am totally committed to the proper treatment of animals of all kinds.  If there was abuse in dog breeding farms, as I know there was, I accept that reasonable regulations have to be implemented.  However, I assure the Minister that those who own and look after greyhounds and beagles look after their dogs like members of their families.  It is impossible to understand the reason these categories of dog were included in the Bill.  It is important for greyhound breeders that their dogs are properly looked after in order that they will perform on the greyhound track.  Otherwise, there would not be any point in remaining in business.  The same position applies as regards beagles.  Many of my neighbours have beagles and look after them extremely well.  I welcome the proposed change to allow those with five breeding bitches or fewer to be exempt from the Act.  A farmer who has bitches incapable of breeding will also be exempt, provided they are sterilised.  I telephoned a friend who is involved in this business to ask him what would be the cost of sterilisation.  He indicated it would be approximately €100 as he had paid £75 north of the Border for the procedure.  It should be noted, however, that a sterilised bitch is no longer suitable for hunting or other purposes as it grows fat and loses the will to hunt.  This issue needs to be examined more carefully.The County Monaghan regional game council has suggested that a different definition of a dog breeding establishment be included in the Bill to provide that the premises or any number of premises owned by the same proprietor where five or more clutches of pups are born in a calendar year should be licensed.  In other words, where fewer than five clutches of pups are born in a given year, the premises would not be a dog breeding establishment for the purposes of the Bill.One of my neighbours has 20 bitches, which between them only had one litter last year.  Although he does not use the dogs for breeding purposes, he will have an enormous burden placed on him by the legislation.  The individual in question, who lost his job, lives across the Border at the moment although his home is on the southern side of the Border.  He receives £69 per week.   For him to pay €400 and all the other expenses would be a major issue.  The Minister should try to keep those sorts of people in mind.  The reality is that there is an increase in suicides in rural areas at present and we do not want any more.However, my concerns and those of Fine Gael are that the Green Party is committed to making things as difficult as possible for the way of rural life, including pursuits such as greyhound racing, fox hunting and beagle hunting and the Minister has certainly done nothing in this Bill to change this view.  The Minister has transferred the greyhound issue to his colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and requires him to have a similar Act in place by 1 January 2011, stating that if this is not done the Minister, Deputy Gormley, will deal with the situation himself.  This clearly shows the difficult relationship there is between the Green Party and Fianna Fáil.I wish to deal with one other major issue, which is the use of microchips to control the dog industry.  The Minister stated in his opening address that the working group recommended that all dogs kept in breeding establishments including their offspring should be electronically micro-chipped to ensure traceability and assist the enforcement of the registration system.  It is rich that the Government is using such a system to control the movement of dogs — which I welcome — when it has refused over the years to use such a system for the movement of cattle.  For some time I have said that the use of a microchip was clearly the ideal and necessary means but the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food always found an excuse to claim it was not suitable.  The present tagging system is totally questionable.  If this is successful in the dog industry, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food might learn something from it.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	92	There are clearly major concerns among those in the dog-breeding industry regarding who will control this system.  Section 17 outlines the different ways that a person breeding dogs with six bitches or more can be controlled.  It is vital that only veterinary surgeons authorised by a local authority should have the final say.  The breeders are rightly very worried that others outside the control of the local authority would have any role in compliance.  I would like the Minister to clarify this.On the issue of the dog licensing I am clearly interested in the figures given by the Minister regarding how much money is collected through the existing fees.  This was an issue I constantly raised when I was a member of Monaghan County Council.  After each of the elections I went through for either the council or the Dáil, I could never understand why there was so little money collected from the dog licence fee because every house I visited had at least one dog and in many cases far more.  I can assure the Minister there were very few houses where there were no dogs at all.  I appreciate that some of them may be strays but I would suggest that 90% of them were owner owned.  Clearly little effort was made to ensure that each dog was licensed.  I would have thought that the first approach to raise more money should have been to improve licence fee collection rather than increase the amount.  If this was done there would be more than sufficient money available to control the sector.I want to return to the general thrust of the Bill.  A full-page article in the Irish Independent reported that Deputy Lowry had negotiations with the Government — I am not sure if it was with the Minister, Deputy Gormley, or with the Taoiseach.  He claims that he has secured sufficient changes to the Bill to allow him to support it.  However, it is vital that the Minister makes it clear in his concluding speech on Second Stage that hunting clubs, owners of beagles and owners of greyhounds are exempt.One active member of the Green Party made a statement at a well attended public meeting in Monaghan town that a puppy farm only a mile from his home was a disgrace or something to that effect.  I visited the only dog breeding farm that I am aware of in that area and found the beagles better looked after than many children.  The Minister and his supporters want to bring about a bureaucracy for dog breeders which is completely unnecessary and I would object to the Bill in that context.It is impossible to believe that the Green Party Members believe this as such an important and serious issue when if they walk out through the door of Leinster House at night they would clearly see those individuals in need of housing lying in doorways.  Even more frightening is a 25% increase in suicide, mainly in rural areas.  For many people living on their own a beagle hunt or a day at the dogs is one of the few things they have to live for and I beg the Minister to ensure that none of these people are even worse off after the Bill is passed than they are at present.  I fully support the control of puppy farms used for commercial purposes.  However, to introduce these other issues is unfair.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-02 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The Dog Breeding Establishment Bill 2009 is, as Deputies have rightly said, primarily focussed on addressing and regulating the breeding of approximately 90,000 puppies per annum, approximately half of which are exported, mainly to the UK in a trade that is worth €29 million.  It definitely needs regulation.  On many occasions in this House we have called for regulation in different quarters having perhaps learned too little too late.  However, this area has been left without regulation for a long time.It is not a Green Party Bill as such, as some would try to insinuate.  It is a legacy from the time of the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche.  It is the implementation of the recommendations of a working group which need to be put into legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, was initially informed it could happen through the Control of Dogs Act.  Subsequently it proved not to be possible to use that Act to address the working group's recommendations and the advice was that it needed separate legislation.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, was landed with this legacy, one might say, but he is not one to shirk his responsibilities and it needs to be implemented.  It needs to include animal shelters and other areas where there are large numbers of dogs, simply because by not doing so it would create loopholes which would put us in a worse situation of having gone through all the trouble of introducing the legislation and then needing to revisit it if loopholes are found.  Unfortunately for those who have an opposite view, there is not much alternative.  However, some amendments are possible and that is where the Minister is trying to address those concerns and build consensus on the matter, given the legacy he has had to deal with.I know many greyhound owners.  Balbriggan is a town of greyhound breeding going back over many years.  One owner asked me today what all the fuss was about.  There is not one greyhound breeder in my town who will be affected by this Bill.  They are all in the business of having one, two or three breeding dogs at the most and that is the case for most greyhound breeders.  All the animal charities support the Bill.  They would have considerably more dogs and less money, given the veterinary fees they need to meet.  I hope the issue can be depoliticised.  Dogs and their welfare should be beyond the kind of sniping that takes place at a party political level.  It is essentially about trying to regulate an area that has been regulated in other countries.  We are learning from their mistakes and I hope we can have good legislation as a result, having listened to all sides in the meantime.
