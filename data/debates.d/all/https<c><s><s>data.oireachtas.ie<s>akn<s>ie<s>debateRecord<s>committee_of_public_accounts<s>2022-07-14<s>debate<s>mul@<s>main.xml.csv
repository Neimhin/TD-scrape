#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	0	I welcome everyone to this morning’s meeting. No apologies have been received. Please note that in order to limit the risk of the spread of Covid-19, the Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving about the campus or within close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people's physical space and to adhere to all public health advice.  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This morning we engage with officials from An Bord Pleanála to examine its 2020 financial statements. At the committee’s request, the board has included briefing material on the following matters which may be examined during the course of the meeting: the status of the implementation of recommendations made in the report, entitled the organisational review of An Bord Pleanála by the independent review group, dated February 2016; judicial reviews of the board’s decision, including the overall number; and how many are decided, how many were successful and the status of live cases. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has provided a briefing note in relation to details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of An Bord Pleanála.  We are joined this morning by the following officials from An Bord Pleanála, Mr. Dave Walsh, cathaoirleach, Mr. Gerard Egan, director of corporate affairs and Ms Anne Killian, finance officer. We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Mr. Graham Doyle, secretary general, and Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning division.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent or switched off. Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. As they are within the precincts of Leinster House they are protected by absolute privilege in respect to the presentations they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege. It is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused. Therefore, if witnesses’ statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such directions. Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Before we move to the opening statements, and in the context of the reminder that I just read out, it is important that members are aware there are number of ongoing inquiries that focus on alleged conflict of interest and governance issues at An Bord Pleanála. To avoid the risk of prejudicing these investigations, as well as other potential proceedings that may follow from their conclusion, members must respect the fact that the review of decisions of the board is a matter for the courts. Because members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the House either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, I will not permit members to question or comment upon specific matters that are subject to the inquiries.  While we have requested information in relation to judicial reviews on the board’s decision and details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of the boards, discussions on these matters should focus on systems, processes and should avoid discussion of specific cases or individuals.  To begin I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	1	As members are aware, An Bord Pleanála is responsible under the Planning and Development Acts for the determination of appeals of local authority planning decisions and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development. The board also has responsibility for dealing with proposals for the compulsory acquisition of land by public authorities and with determining appeals under the Water Pollution and Building Control Acts. The board's income in 2020 totalled €28.9 million. Some €19.2 million, or almost two thirds of the income, came from Exchequer cash grants via the Vote for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Just over €6.7 million, or 23% was received in application fees. Expenditure in 2020 amounted to €31.5 million. Salaries and related costs amounted to €17.4 million, representing around 55% of the board's expenditure in 2020. Expenditure related to premises and other operating expenses totalled €5.8 million. The board’s expenditure and legal fees in 2020 amounted to €8.3 million. This was significantly up on the figure of €3.4 million, which was incurred in 2019. This was significantly up on the €3.4 million incurred in 2019. About half of the expenditure in 2020 was accounted for by the board's legal fees in defending cases, with the other half representing payment of the costs of persons taking cases against the board following the settlement of cases. Following audit, the 2020 financial statements were certified on 30 June 2021 and a clear audit opinion was issued. The audit of the 2021 financial statements is ongoing.

I welcome Mr. Walsh back to the committee. He was here in May of last year. As detailed in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes for his opening statement. I know the statement is a bit longer than that, and I want to grant him that time. I read the statement yesterday. I invite Mr. Walsh to proceed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	3	I appreciate that. I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to assist in its examination of An Bord Pleanála’s financial statements for 2020, and to discuss the board’s important work as well as recent progress in delivering on our statutory mandate. We will endeavour to address all queries as best we can, but, with the committee's indulgence, I may ask my colleagues to come in on some more technical matters that may be raised during the session because they may be more familiar with such matters. As the Chairman outlined, it important to remind the committee that it would not be appropriate to discuss individual cases. To do so could compromise decisions or, indeed, various judicial review cases before the courts. However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will aim to be as helpful as we can. While not strictly relating to the 2020 financial statements, I might take the opportunity to briefly outline to the committee the nature and status of a number of ongoing reviews, although, unfortunately, I am not in a position to elaborate much more on these matters and processes while they are ongoing. In recent months, a number of issues and allegations have arisen in respect of potential conflicts of interest and the effectiveness of board systems and procedures. I fully recognise the seriousness of these issues and the potential damage that these allegations have done to the board’s reputation for integrity, independence and impartiality. I have commissioned a team of senior managers to examine any issues arising, with a view to identifying areas which may require improvements in relation to the suitability and effectiveness of existing controls, procedures and systems which are designed to manage potential conflicts of interest and related matters. I will take whatever actions and implement whatever reforms may be necessary and appropriate to strengthen our systems and procedures in order to ensure that they are as legally robust and fit for purpose as possible and practicable, and with a view to maintaining public confidence in the impartiality of the board’s decision-making processes. In the same context, I will also take account of any outcomes and proposed recommendations from the ongoing review being undertaken on behalf of the Minister, as well as the targeted review of the board’s systems and procedures proposed to be undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator later this year. As committed to as part of its five-year strategy, the board is currently reviewing its code of conduct and any outcomes or recommendations arising from these reviews will be integrated into the code review process, which is expected to be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year. The board is well aware of its critical role within the planning system, in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals and we remain committed to delivering robust decisions as quickly and effectively as possible. We are also very cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities and I can confirm that the board considers itself generally in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies. We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee, internal audits as well as undertaking regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risks and mitigation actions. The committee will have noted from our annual report and accounts that, in financial terms, the board had a total income of just over €26 million in 2020, primarily comprising an Exchequer grant of €19.25 million and fees revenue of just under €6.8 million. This represented an increase from 2019, when we received €18.6 million in Exchequer grants and took in just over €5.4 million in fee revenue. To give the committee a little background on the organisation, the board currently has just over 191 whole-time equivalent staff and nine board members. The Minister and Department have been very supportive in approving resource requests, in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments, SHDs, and major infrastructure projects. The board is currently engaging with the Department in respect of an updated workforce plan for the period 2022-23 to meet its evolving needs and current and future work demands. The board's primary role is to make planning decisions in a timely manner, in accordance with the legislative framework under which we operate and having regard to the overarching planning policy framework as determined by the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as considering local planning policies and the observations from the public and prescribed bodies. While I appreciate that we are discussing the 2020 annual report and accounts, I would like to give the committee a more up-to-date picture of our casework levels using more current statistics that we have to hand. These last couple of years have been very challenging for An Bord Pleanála as they have been for many other organisations and for society generally, with major disruptions to normal life and work practices due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which we are still experiencing and managing with the latest wave. However, despite these disruptions, the board has been able to keep our public office open in a safe manner through the pandemic phases and was also able to maintain a consistent throughput of case decisions. We adapted our practices to enable online services and virtual meetings, including the holding of remote oral hearings,and facilitated hybrid office and home working patterns for all staff to ensure that we fully adhered to all health and safety requirements and advices for both staff and the public. In 2021 the board saw a substantial increase in the overall number of cases lodged, with a total of 3,251 received, up 18% on the previous year. The number of cases decided by the board in 2021 was up just under 6% on the previous year’s total, with 2,775 cases decided. While some of these increases maybe attributed to the return to normal business following the extensive Covid-related disruptions during 2020, there has also been a marked increase in activity in the planning sector, reflecting the increased residential development activity, as well as wider economic activity across a range of sectors. On normal planning appeals, the compliance rate with our statutory objective period, SOP, for 2021 fell back to 58% from the 76% recorded in 2020. This was due to a confluence of factors including the significant rise in case numbers received, reduced staffing capacity arising from the impact of Covid with isolation periods, absences, changes in work practices with ongoing restrictions and managing staff capacity including filling vacancies and covering sick leave in a very challenging environment. With the significant volume of cases on hand at the end of 2021 and ongoing disruptions from the latest Covid waves, it is proving a significant challenge to reverse this downward trend and return to more acceptable levels of compliance this year. In the first six months of this year, there has been continued strong case intake with almost 1,600 new applications and appeal cases lodged and some 1,350 cases disposed. With the significant backlog of cases and prioritisation given to housing and strategic infrastructure cases, the SOP compliance for normal appeals has dipped further to 44%, but we are exploring all options to improve our performance and are working hard to get back to higher compliance levels with the SOP as soon as possible. In respect of SHDs, the board has continued to prioritise these and just over 100 cases were decided in 2021, with all but one of these determined within the 16-week statutory timeline. Of these, the board granted permission in 76 cases and refused permission in 25. There is still a significant volume of applications within the system that will continue to be determined over the coming months, while the new large-scale residential development, LRD, process is already up and running with the local planning authorities. Similarly, the board saw a jump in strategic infrastructure applications received in 2021, with 30 applications lodged, up from 24 in 2020, and 30 cases decided, up from 19 in 2020. The total of 74 pre-application consultation requests during 2021, 24 more than were lodged in 2020, indicates a significant ramping up of major complex applications being considered and proposed. Amid all the Covid-related disruptions, the pandemic provided us with a valuable opportunity to facilitate a greater online and digital offering to staff and the general public. The board’s case management system enabled remote working for all staff, and the ongoing development of the board’s online capability was extended during the year to enable observations on planning appeals and strategic infrastructure cases, as well as SHD cases, to be made through our web portal. The online submission option is a key step in the board’s plans to provide more online services such as virtual oral hearings and ultimately the online receipt of applications and appeals over time. I also welcome the launch of the board’s new website which is another step in providing more user-friendly and accessible information to all who avail of our services. Working closely with the local authorities’ e-planning initiative,I am hopeful that we will see further phased roll-out of online services over the coming months and into 2023. The significant increase in the volume of legal challenges to board decisions during 2020 has continued in 2021, with 83 new cases in 2020 and 95 in 2021. These applications for judicial review of the legality of decisions involve significant detailed legal scrutiny of complex matters of procedure and interpretation relating to European Union environmental directives and other issues arising from the strategic housing development application process.All of those cases are dealt with by the superior courts, that is, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and questions relating to the EU law elements can be referred from those courts to the Court of Justice of the European Union for adjudication. Legal costs for representation before the courts are substantial, and there has been a significant escalation of such costs in both 2020 and 2021. Our gross legal costs were €8.4 million in 2020 and are currently accounted for at €7.7 million in our draft unaudited financial statements for 2021. These legal costs are split between our costs for solicitor and barrister representation and payments for undersigned costs in instances where the case is lost or conceded. In respect of the latter, it is accepted that in 2020 and 2021, legal case outcomes revealed a significant number of losses and concessions, amounting to 32 in 2020 and 40 in 2021. The board is conscious that it needs to continuously review its procedures and approaches to certain matters, having regard to legal judgments and ongoing advice from its legal advisers, with a view to ensuring its decisions are as legally robust as possible. This process is ongoing but it is still the case that certain areas of planning law remain open to various legal interpretations and are, therefore, still contentious and complex. When considered appropriate, the board has, in a small number of selected cases, sought to appeal certain decisions to the relevant appellant courts. In terms of costs, the prevailing statutory context around planning judicial reviews is that the board is made liable for applicant costs where it loses or concedes a case but generally does not have its own costs awarded against judicial review applicants where it successfully defends the legality of its planning decisions. I will leave it there instead of taking up more of members' time. I am happy to take any questions.

In May last year, Mr. Walsh stated at a meeting of this committee:Our existence and our reputation are based on transparency and accountability.

As I said at the start, there are a number of ongoing reviews that have yet to be finalised. Until such time as they are finalised, we do not have any findings and recommendations arising from them. As things stand, I cannot comment any further in regard to any allegations that are out there and are being examined.

In fact, I have a total figure here that includes the salaries of both the directors and the chief officer. That figure was €1.52 million in 2021. There are three officials included in that, namely, the director of corporate affairs, the chief officer and the director of planning, as well as the remaining board members.

There used to be a link between the chairperson's salary and that of a judge of the High Court, but that link was broken in 2011. The chairperson's salary is now at the direction of the Minister and the latter has directed that it be at the level of a Secretary General, grade 3.

I have a question in regard to judicial reviews. Between 2013 and 2021, how many judicial reviews did An Bord Pleanála concede or not contest?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	53	It really depends on the year-to-year situation. The table I provided to the committee gives information in this regard. There were no judicial reviews lost in 2012. Eight were lost or conceded in 2013, six in 2014, three in 2015, eight in 2016, 12 in 2017, 12 in 2018, 15 in 2019, 32 in 2020 and 40 in 2021.

Why is Mr. Walsh not defending the board's decisions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	55	That figure covers cases that were lost and conceded. There is a combination of court judgments against the board in some of those cases. To set the context, the difficulty and challenge for the board is that where we get a ruling from the court, which may be nine or 12 months after the judicial review papers are lodged, the board will, in the meantime, have made a substantial number of decisions, given the volume of cases we are dealing with, particularly in the context of SHD cases. If the court ultimately decides a particular issue or a particular interpretation of law is incorrect, that has knock-on consequences for cases that are still in the system.

An Bord Pleanála lost 32 of 35 cases.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	75	No. If anything, the evolving nature of case law and the complexity around some of the interpretations of the legislation that we are dealing with, including environmental and EU legislation, pose significant challenges. The board's job is to make decisions on the basis of the information it has. If we subsequently find out that a judicial review of a case that was lodged the previous year has identified a particular issue, why would the board continue to defend a similar issue in a case when it can instead concede and not tie up the court's time? It can cut its losses and the case can be remitted.

It is actually about connections and connected persons, for example, whether the person in question knows someone who is impacted by the case or is potentially involved in it. I grew up in north Dublin. My mother is still there. If a case involving her street or the street beside her came before us, I would not be involved because of the potential risk of conflict, but if it involved the other side of the parish where I knew no one and had not lived for 30 years, there would be no conflict in my own view. However, it comes down to making a judgment and a personal assessment by each person, be that an inspector or a board member.

There are certain types of cases that can be considered by two-person boards. The last time it was brought to the board was in July 2019 with a list of cases that could be considered by two-person boards in the interest of efficiency.

The 2016 review states that small-scale development proposals should generally be determined by a division comprising of a single board member, unless that board member disagrees with the inspector's report. Therefore, anything that is looking for a deviation from that must be larger-scale developments.

I think the majority of the cases are strategic housing and strategic infrastructure. There are rural houses but we do not do them because they are kind of not committed under the two-person board, nor is anything that might have a particular sensitive or complexity around it.

We are talking about semantics a little bit, and about words, but I find the use of the word "board" here confusing. In the Committee of Public Accounts we are used to senior management in an organisation having a State board or a board and they are not in the organisation full time. They are given a small stipend, hold a quarterly meeting and there is oversight of the board. They have the power to remove senior staff or senior appointees if that is required. An Bord Pleanála does not have that kind of facility in the legislation. Is that correct?

Would it be accurate for me to say that in terms of the decision-making and the public trust that is required in An Bord Pleanála's work, the code of conduct is quite important in terms of its performance and that it would adhere to that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	189	Hugely.

Section 4.3 of the code of conduct states "No employee shall accept emolument for any outside employment which may in any way represent or may be reasonably interpreted as representing a conflict of interest on any matters pertaining to the functions undertaken by An Bord Pleanála other than with the written consent of the Chief Officer." I point out to Mr. Walsh the use of that word "emolument", because it is not necessarily salary. Obviously, it also includes networking, professional profile and any kind of benefit to oneself. If, again, there is a deviation from that code of conduct, written permission from Mr. Walsh is required. How many times has Mr. Walsh given written permission to an employee or a member of a board to deviate from that code of conduct?

The board would have taken a couple of cases to seek clarity as much as anything else in respect of cases it lost. We have taken probably three or four cases during my time. It is probably somewhere around 5%.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	229	Perhaps we could get a table over a five-year time period.

To be fair, the court is trying to expedite most of the court cases. The proposals around a planning and environmental court would possibly assist in expediting it. On that point, not actually having a final ruling for 12 or 18 months when we are continuing to make decisions is the ongoing challenge. How does one retrospectively address some of those issues in the cases that are before the courts or in cases thereafter?

I will move to the 2016 organisational review of An Bord Pleanála. There were 101 recommendations in that report in 2016.

What is the position with the other recommendations? That report is from over six years ago.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	238	It is, indeed. It is important to understand that it is a report that has fed in a lot to the board's work. All the 36 actions relate to the actions on which the board is leading. The board has partially implemented another 21 of the remaining actions but we have not completed them all. Taking those two together, that is 57 of the 70 actions. Some 31 of the actions that remain are legislative issues that are being considered as part of the planning review and the Department can address those. The board has not been sitting on its hands doing nothing on these issues. When we were preparing our five-year strategic plan in 2018, we incorporated all of what we saw were the pragmatic and reasonable steps and actions that were recommended within the report. We have built them into our five-year strategy. That strategy is live until 2023. As part of that process, every year the board adopts what it calls an annual delivery plan, with clear actions and outcomes to be taken.

There are 36 implemented and 21 partially implemented.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	242	Some of them are kind of impractical. A good example would be a recommendation that the board should use local offices when it has oral hearings in regional locations. A lot of the oral hearings the board conducts in regional locations are compulsory purchase order, CPO, related cases that often involve the local authority so it would inappropriate for the board to be organising a meeting where people are challenging a compulsory purchase, possibly an application that a planning authority either brought or supported. That is an action which in some respects, where there is no local authority involvement, one could say is reasonable to save money for the taxpayer and use available space within a local authority office but it cannot be done in all cases. That is the subtlety around how the board has looked at each of the 70 actions on which we are leading.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	243	Regarding the 31 which Mr. Walsh says require legislative change, has there been engagement with the Department about that change? On the one hand there is a report recommending changes, and on the other, the board is saying legislative change is required. Why do we not have that change six years later?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	244	Again, that is probably a question for the Department to answer. Certainly, there has been active engagement. We have an implementation group that comprises officials from the Department and from the board to look at all the actions and how they are being addressed. Some of them may well ultimately not be implemented. That is not to say that the recommendations were not made in good faith but they probably do not fit the statutory or the structural aspects of the board. It is an external review that provided observations. The Department has been looking at a range of legislative reforms. Since the report was issued in 2016 we have had major changes through strategic housing and we have had many other disruptions and new functions being taken on by the board. I do not know if the Department's representative would like to comment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	252	Anything over 100 bed spaces is the qualifying threshold for it. The number we have given relates to judicial reviews lost as opposed to judicial reviews received because something that is received in a year can still take a year or a year and a half to get a ruling. I can revert to the committee and give more detailed information on how many of the 126 were subsequently judicially reviewed in the courts.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	254	There have been judicial reviews in respect of refusals as well - it is not always grants - and they would be first party generally. It is not only the grants that would be judicially reviewed. I can give a summary table on the actual numbers over the last few years.

If a local authority wants to carry out any development, it is tied by Irish Water as regards whether Irish Water can provide a service. Does Mr. Walsh not think that we have a particular problem in that we have so many players in the field now? There is the local authority, Irish Water, the Planning Regulator, An Bord Pleanála and judicial review. There are quite a lot of people in the field now with regard to planning. Is that not causing many unnecessary delays as well?

I know of one case where more than 50 houses have been built but cannot be sold for the next two to three years because Irish Water cannot provide a service, even though that was not initially indicated.

The board periodically meets with representatives from Irish Water, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and other statutory consultees to understand and discuss capacity constraints and policy issues that impinge on the board's decisions. As part of their own development, they have programmes of investment works coming through. The dialogue is very important to understanding the context in which the board makes fairly large-scale decisions. The more co-ordinated efforts there are - and the SHD process-----

I have come across a situation in which a State authority objected to a school being built by the Department of Education. It had to go all the way to An Bord Pleanála. Even though undertakings were given to that State authority, it still insisted on a decision from An Bord Pleanála.

The board assesses any information it has. If someone objects within the legislative framework, the board has to consider an appeal, whether from a private entity or individual or from a State body.

In this case, there was engagement. This cost no one working in that State authority anything but it cost the taxpayer money.

Greater dialogue at the start of the process, which was of use in the SHD process, can stand to address issues before a point is reached where a decision has to be appealed to the board.

Remy Farrell is now undertaking a review for the Department, the Planning Regulator is carrying out an investigation and the board is carrying out an internal audit, which Mr. Walsh has described.

I said:There will then be a meeting with three representatives, two of whom - who will remain unnamed - may decide to overturn the recommendation of their own inspector and the local authority's decision, while providing minimal information as to how they came to that decision. It is quite possible that these representatives will never have set foot in the county, never mind having looked at the site in question. I do not aim to cast aspersions on any members of the board, current or past, but does Mr. Walsh see how there is the potential for corruption in such a system?Mr. Walsh responded:I completely reject any allegations of corruption. Sorry Deputy, I think it is unfair to make any claims like that.He said this even though I had been very clear that I was not making any claims. As Deputy Munster has noted, Mr. Walsh also said:I would challenge anybody to say that there is anything other than proper consideration given to all applications and appeals that come before us.Given that there are now three separate reviews, investigations, audits or whatever you want to call them under way, does Mr. Walsh now accept that there was, in fact, scope for corruption in the way in which the board is structured?

The challenge for the board, as with any organisation, is to identify instances of this and to take swift and decisive action. The outcome of the reviews will provide me with evidence and with recommendations for appropriate action.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	290	The system is in place. Notwithstanding the issues that have arisen in recent months, the board has clear systems in place. We receive a lot of correspondence from individuals regarding cases they may have been involved in, whether during or after the process. We also receive other queries and we receive correspondence from Oireachtas Members. There is a process in place to deal with any query that comes through. While I cannot speak on behalf of the Minister or others, the board has a process to examine every matter raised with it.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	291	Here is the problem. If anybody, regardless of how powerful they are or anything else, has a fundamental difficulty with a decision made by An Bord Pleanála, the only recourse available to that person is to take a judicial review, JR, or legal action. There is no other mechanism. Mr. Walsh has said that in respect of cases regarding which very serious issues have been raised. Even if the board's audit, Remy Farrell or the Planning Regulator determines that a decision was made that relied on bad practice or corruption, those involved will have no recourse other than the courts.

These are the issues we are currently reviewing.

Reading through the transcript, we see that several members from across different political parties raised issues on 13 May 2021 with regard to the soaring legal costs, the scope for conflicts of interest and the potential trends that were emerging.Members dealing on a part-time basis with oversight of 250 bodies were able to ask him about all those issues, and his response to all of them was that there is nothing to see and that processes and procedures were in place. Does he now accept committee members were able to identify it and it was journalists, not An Bord Pleanála or any system it has in place, who exposed the issues leading to the three reviews, when it was Mr. Walsh's job to do that? Does Mr. Walsh not consider that he has failed in his job as Accounting Officer to An Bord Pleanála?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	300	I do not. I do not mind who raises issue, whether it is individuals, Oireachtas Members or journalists. We have a transparent system whereby people can come in, view files and get access to any records associated with decisions. If people then bring issues to our attention for consideration or examination of what they consider to be potential non-compliance with the requirements of the procedures or code of conduct, we look at those issues. In relation to the JRs, the Deputy says the committee highlighted the issue last year. Of course we do not want that number of JRs but the reality is that in the system and the decisions the board takes, the courts have a role and individuals have recourse to that. That is the only line of appeal because the board is dealing with the applications as opposed to-----

Despite that, the board continued to find on the exact same basis and was repeatedly taken to court where it repeatedly lost, to the point where €8 million per year, one third of the budget, was spent on legal fees. Mr. Walsh did not say "Stop".
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	302	As I said earlier when we were talking about the court cases, if a judicial review is taken on an issue, there can be many reasons, from compliance with EU directives to requirements around associated documentation. It is not simply the same issue in every case. There is a time lag from when a JR is lodged to when it is concluded and the court makes its ruling. In the meantime, a significant number - probably eight - SHD applications are decided by the board every month because that is the statutory timeline we have to make those decisions. If we wait 12 or 18 months, we have a body of cases either in the courts or-----

I put it to Mr. Walsh that as Accounting Officer he had an obligation to identify an emerging problem, an obligation to ensure case files were being distributed to board members on a random basis and an obligation to ensure this body would not bring the planning process into disrepute, which is exactly what has happened. Nobody has confidence in An Bord Pleanála as it stands, and that happened under Mr. Walsh's leadership. I believe his position is untenable and do not know how he has not come to the same conclusion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	304	The board takes lessons from every judicial review. We get legal advice on all the actions, and comments from the board. We integrate those into our learnings for the inspectorate's analysis and the board in terms of the decisions it can and cannot take. On average, because of the judicial reviews and the lessons we have built in, the inspectorate reports have probably increased in length by 50% to 70% purely to cover off many issues of which the courts have said there is insufficient analysis. To say we are not taking any actions arising from the judicial reviews is incorrect. In the last two weeks, the Supreme Court made rulings on two similar cases decided by different judges with different outcomes. Even the courts are struggling to identify the issues.

It is good to have them before us again and it is certainly timely. I will take up from what Deputy Carthy touched on regarding the 2020 expenditure of €8.3 million in legal fees. That was significantly up on the 2019 figure of €3.4 million. However, the number of cases is down 12% on the 2019 figure. What is the difference? What accounts for more expenditure yet a 12% reduction in the volume of cases?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	309	It is the cost associated with preparing for and defending judicial reviews and the length of time these cases take. The longer a case requires to be defended and continues through the courts, the greater the cost. We deal with very expensive litigation in the higher courts. That adds to the overall cost of the board. As the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined, roughly half of the costs we incurred were our costs and half were incurred by third parties where we lost. We do not defend cases where we feel there are significant weaknesses or flaws. In cases where our legal advice is that this is a difficult one, rather than delay, incur further costs and tie up the courts, we would take concessions so the case can be remitted. Cases that were lodged in 2018 were only coming to court in 2020 and 2021. Some of those new JRs are being deferred into the court system at that point.

He said cases have become more complex, but what has the board done to try to protect the taxpayer?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	315	As I mentioned to Deputy Carthy, for every case that is opened, we get legal advice from our team to assess the strength and potential weaknesses within the board's processes and decisions. On the basis of that advice, if we feel it would be more expedient for the board and taxpayer to say there may have been an error, we hold up our hands. When we are dealing with 3,000 cases per year, sometimes errors are made, there are omissions or insufficient justification is provided in relation to a decision. Rather than pursuing those and incurring huge costs, we concede those cases. If any advice comes back from those kinds of cases or cases that have rulings at the end of the process, we build those back in. We have an inspectorate-----

In terms of legal costs, does the board have an in-house legal section or does it outsource that?

Two solicitor firms service us and we have a range of barristers to draw on. A recommendation in the 2016 report was that we should bring in and hire in-house counsel. We tried that and got sanctioned by the Department to advertise for in-house counsel. We did not get anybody who was willing to come in at the salary level we were applying for.

A number of these are overturned. Despite the inspectors' views the board takes a different decision. Does Mr. Walsh have a percentage of how often that is done?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	323	In recent years I do not think we have actually tracked the percentage. The last figures I have seen were in late 2019 or thereabouts. It can go up and down but generally it falls between one in six or seven cases is overturned. Apologies, I have an update here, in 2020 some 90% of the recommendations made by inspectors were generally accepted by the board. That was 89%, so it is 10% or 11%.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	329	Generally it is three, sometimes four. When we have two quorums of three we can actually have two meetings running concurrently. Because we are dealing with 3,000-odd cases a year the board would probably convene between 700 and 800 meetings a year. That requires meetings in the morning, in the afternoon and obviously if we have a full available board as in nine or ten people we can actually have three quorums at the same time.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	330	To me, a quorum is the minimum on which to operate. To my mind to operate on a minimum and have several meetings running concurrently would not be satisfactory given the outcome and certainly the position Mr. Walsh is in today. Is that going to be reviewed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	331	From my perspective, I am dealing with a large backlog of cases in the system at the moment, so the more board meetings I can have and we can make decisions on the quicker I will be able to work down the backlog of cases we have. In regard to large-scale cases some fairly large infrastructure cases would mean bringing all available board members in. As things stand at the moment I have eight board members available to me. There are two divisions, strategic housing which has four members and strategic infrastructure has five members. Three would be the norm. I am satisfied that provides enough variety of views and context.

It started in July 2015 and was published in 2016. I am quoting from the senior counsel's own statement that says "The Review Group was set a tight timeframe set by the Minister for carrying out its tasks. Sometimes that is the best way." Obviously only 36 of the 101 recommendations have been implemented. Why is that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	335	As I said, a number of them relate to legislative review issues. There are 31 of those included. Of the 70 that remain for the board to deal with 36 have been fully completed, about 21 of them are in train and partially completed, and there are others that we may not implement at all because some of them are not, as I mentioned to others, pragmatic in the context of how the board operates and indeed what is appropriate. We have integrated many of these actions into our five-year strategy. The fact that the record shows only 36 complete does not necessarily reflect the fact of broader implementation.

The system went live in October 2017. The board has been using that system. Indeed as I said in my opening statement we had an online system that all staff could avail of remotely. We are continuing to develop it. We took on new functions once the initial development had been agreed in 2015. We went live in 20107 and we plan to continue to enhance it with a view to ultimately having online capability later this year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	347	Since 2014 across this wider - it includes the draft 2021 accounts which have not been signed off - we spent just less than €5.4 million.

Given Deputy Carthy's comments and how he put it, and Deputy Munster as well, Mr. Walsh does not feel the need to apologise because there are no results of the review. There are €8.2 million in legal fees. Does that not warrant an apology?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	349	I think it is the reality of the work the board does in that we actually have to make complex decisions. Indeed only yesterday in the Dáil there were discussions around the complexity of some legislative amendments coming through. When you are navigating a whole range of views there are of necessity some that will be challenged in the courts-----

There were obviously illegal actions, unlawful actions, either by board members or inspectors that warranted him to concede 40 cases this year and 32 last year. What measures has he taken to prevent it in the future?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	359	I will give an example, without going into individual cases, about what the courts found about one and a half years ago in regard to the analysis that the board reports and the board decisions were not providing sufficient information on analysis around sunlight and daylight. It is a very simple issue. One might say "where is the justification to enable us to satisfy ourselves on that issue?" That actually affected a number of cases. The board conceded those cases but since then - and back to the issue I mentioned to both Deputies Carthy and Devlin - the board has integrated those learnings into the reports so that now every single report that comes through on any file like that covers fully all of those aspects. The simple question is "How have we learned from those lessons?"

It is up to the courts to interpret Mr. Walsh's mistakes. What is wrong here with An Bord Pleanála is gross negligence. If it was in the private sector somebody would be sacked. Who has lost his or her job because of this? Who has been reprimanded to the extent that we could justify wasting, squandering €8.2 million of taxpayers' money? Who has Mr. Walsh sanctioned?

That is a binary question. Yes or no, has Mr. Walsh sanctioned anybody?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	369	There was no sanction in regard to cases that the courts have decided.

Where do we go with standards in public office in An Bord Pleanála? Where do they fit in or do they?

It has been an interesting and informative debate. I will take a slightly different approach or angle to the discussion because I will focus on housing delivery. Up and down my constituency I have people, and young people in particular, who would like to live in or remain in areas in which they have grown up. As a councillor and Deputy, I have felt long-term frustration in dealing with strategic housing applications and other types of housing applications but not seeing that turn into places for such young people to live. That is what I wanted to follow up and I suggest there is a strong role for the Department in that. In respect of the strategic housing developments, what is the total number of units that have been applied for? How many of those have been granted permission and how many were commenced or built?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	476	Is that for the Department?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	478	I will get precise numbers for the Deputy but broadly speaking, in Dublin there are approximately 40,000 extant planning permissions and there are 70,000 to 80,000 nationwide. We will be monitoring the number of strategic housing developments granted by the board and not quashed, as well as the timeline to delivery. Normally speaking, one would expect to see a development start within two years but we were concerned at the beginning of Housing for All that many of the permissions are not turning into housing. That is why there are a number of actions in Housing for All dealing with issues around viability, such as the Croí Cónaithe cities scheme, with the provision for the first homes launched during the week. There are also broader issues regarding cost of construction because many of the strategic housing developments are very large and they tend to be apartments.We know that the costs of building them are quite high. From a policy perspective, we look at the outcome of the board, which gives us the data. We then look at the data in terms of what has started. We can pass that on to the committee.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	479	From a public representation perspective, it is very frustrating to see what I suggest are aggressive applications being made relative to the neighbourhood. People wonder whether the developer is doing it deliberately in order to be constrained. It deeply upsets the local community. If an even slightly softer approach were taken, people would be on board because they want to see the development of housing. It is just a little pushy and aggressive. If there are nine storeys instead of seven in an old, established residential area, people become very upset. Councillors make all these observations at local level and the application goes to An Bord Pleanála. Mr. Walsh might respond as to how many times applications of that nature have been varied by An Bord Pleanála to be more consistent with the local environment. My major concern, having gone through that process and with people being very clearly upset, is that we still need houses but I do not see them getting built. I investigated some of this in my area. Ms Graham is right about cost and that is one issue, but why are we spending time on applications without being sure these things can in fact be built? Is there any measure of consideration given on that side? The significant amount of State time, energy and cost to assess the applications, including local energy and investment and the role of the local council, is one thing. Difficulties with Irish Water come up again and again. There is then the matter of judicial reviews. I have spoken to developers to try to weed out what the specific issues are, either with the council or Irish Water. Why are they not developing in the area I represent where I know people need housing? Judicial review comes up again and again. I have no difficulty with residents associations, or people directly affected who have been involved in a process or are adjacent to it, taking judicial reviews, but my question relates to judicial reviews being taken where the applicant had not been previously engaged or involved in any sense. Does Mr. Walsh have any sense of the proportion of judicial review applications where an applicant had not been involved in any way prior to taking such an application? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	480	On the first question on how many times the board has varied designs or decisions, I cannot say because I do not sit on every single case. We do not track whether a floor has disappeared or a block is amended. Sometimes they are subtle and sometimes not, but each case is assessed on the basis of its particular location and its proximity to other developments. It is very difficult to say that a five-, three- or seven-storey building here will not have the same impact as a seven-storey building somewhere else. Judgments and assessments are made on the basis of a building's impact on daylight and sunlight, including in respect of its future occupants. We often think about what is happening for properties and people who are living in the area already, but one of the key considerations is what the quality of life and space and size are. Do they meet the minimum requirements? Do people get enough sunlight and daylight into their amenity space or balcony? I am aware and have sat in meetings where there have been instances where not only have we removed some floors, as recommended either by the planning authority or the inspector, but in some respects we have removed some blocks, particularly on a larger scale, where we feel open space is at more of a premium. The board has the scope to make those amendments and to look at it, but our job is not to redesign the thing to make it right. Where we feel those additional measures can address the key concerns and requirements around standards, that is an option open to the board. On the Deputy's other question on parties who may not have participated in the process, judicial reviews are generally taken by people who have engaged, either as an observer in the local authority or as an observer and submitter in the board's direct applications. That is a requirement for someone to then take a judicial review. It is irrelevant to the board whether they are raising major or minor issues. If somebody makes a valid submission and observation on an application or appeal, that person is party to the decision and will get the due consideration that everybody else will get. Obviously, if the individual only identifies one issue or talks about compliance with EU law, that is as much a consideration as whether it has an impact on amenities in a residential neighbourhood. That is the practical approach. I am not sure if that addresses the Deputy's question. I do not have numbers on it but that is the reviews.

It is probably best not to go into individual instances. What does the Department estimate the additional cost of judicial reviews to be? A judicial review can of course be taken but when it comes to delivery, I am concerned about people who actually want to buy places to live in. What is the cost inflation implication of the duration of a judicial review on delivery of the end product? If the project has been costed at the outset, what is the cost implication of a standard judicial review?

It builds in a risk factor. Figures vary of course but I have heard, in some cases, figures of €2 million on a big development, where somebody puts judicial review in as a contingency.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	483	I ask Mr. Doyle to give me an example for an apartment. A figure of €2 million does not mean anything on a big development but, for example, if a young person in my constituency wants to buy an apartment that is being priced at €400,000 because it has gone through a judicial review and all sorts of different things, what cost is being built in to anticipate judicial review?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	484	I have not seen a broken-down cost like that, but it has been said very clearly that it affects the risk premium developers pay for funds to their funders, due to the risk of a large-scale development being subject to judicial review.

At the end of the day, the cost is being passed on, whether a judicial review is taken or not. If a risk premium is being built into the financing of a project in anticipation of such a review, which I again say people are entitled to take, that is a meaningful effect on cost. People are telling us that. It is important the Department be aware of that, particularly at a time of such acute cost inflation. Will the officials come back to us with some analysis of that?

It is one of the reasons for the move away from SHD for large-scale developments back to that two-stage process to try to have fewer scenarios that result in judicial review. The hope is that will bring down those numbers and, therefore, those costs the Deputy mentioned.

From a transparency and public confidence perspective generally, however, if we go back to the people who live beside applications, and this will persist in respect of the new system also, it is important people see that the board can vary and has varied, and that they see the way in which that can and does happen. Is there any analysis that can be done on the 2020 figures, for example, of the number of occasions where something was varied relative to the application? For example, there was a very significant application to site a co-living space in my constituency, which is the subject of significant discontent. The board varied it very considerably but that never really fed through in the same way. It is important from a public confidence perspective to know whether, where and how that is actually happening.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	488	We can look at it to see if we can get some information. The Deputy mentioned public confidence and the understanding of the system. It is important that over the past three or four years, the challenge and complexity around what the board has been dealing with in relation to SHDs primarily relates to the fact that national policy, that is, the national planning framework, NPF, and national guidelines have moved far more quickly than some of the local plans. The board is looking at national as well as local policies. It has to try to balance and assess whether the local plans, which predate the national planning framework or the apartment guidelines, fit in with those. We are now at a point where because most of the planning authorities' new development plans are being updated to take account of the NPF, the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, and all the new updated guidelines, there will be far less need for the board to materially contravene many local plans because they are not in line with national policy. Many of the issues to date, and much of the controversy or concern, arise from the fact we have someone looking for something that is outside the density or height levels. When the new plans come through, that will make it clearer. As the Secretary General said, it will certainly be relevant when it comes to the LRD processes that are coming through.

The officials all know because they were there, but for clarity Mr. Walsh was assistant secretary when I was Minister, though in a totally different area, to be fair. I commissioned the organisational review under Gregory Jones in 2016 because I believed it was necessary as it had never been done before. We had never had a review of An Bord Pleanála and I had concerns. All the actions have been listed as either "complete", "ongoing" or "to be determined". What is the breakdown? There is also a note saying a number of issues cannot be dealt with until the review of Housing for All is complete because there is a legislative capacity on that, which I understand because I have asked about it in the Dáil. However, there have been six years in between. There are so many issues here that have never been dealt with. For instance, recommendations Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, on the appointment of members to the board, have never been implemented, and it is pretty obvious that they have to be. One of them is basically that it said the nominating bodies were completely out of date, which seems a pretty obvious one. Why then have they not been implemented and what is the breakdown regarding the three areas under which the board is claiming status on all the recommendations, six years after it was completed?

He may forgive me if I go over some of the information I have provided. Of the 101 actions, 31 are primarily statutory. They require legislative consideration.

For instance, one request I have is that the officials give us the dates and minutes of any ministerial management advisory committee, MINMAC, meetings over the six years referenced in this review.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	496	Okay. I will come back to the Deputy on that. There is obviously an implementation group that was set up. I think that was something the Deputy mandated himself at the time, as I understand it. I am more recent to the organisation. In the context of the recommendations around appointments and open processes, I think there was a recommendation in the review that two members be appointed by an external process. What we are now moving to will of course require a legislative update as part of the review of the planning legislation. I think this was the first recommendation in the review in 2016. This has been worked through over the last 12 months. There has been intense engagement across a number of forums, particularly with the Attorney General's office, around that. The Minister is very much in favour of moving to open recruitment across the board.

I thank Mr. Doyle. I am asking what happened in the years in between. Why was nothing done? That is basically the question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	498	I do not think it was the case that nothing was done. A number of these matters will require debate, policy decision and ultimately legislation by the Oireachtas. Of course, all of this has been done at the same time as some very significant planning changes that have been made over recent years, including various things we have mentioned today, from SHDs to large-scale developments to a whole bunch of other things.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	499	Okay. From a time and efficiency point of view, the best way for us to deal with this is by looking at the breakdown of the actions requiring legislative change that fall within the Department's remit. Will Mr. Doyle provide for us, from MINMAC minutes, any references to any of those actions? Then we will see if any progress was being made on any of them. If they were being pursued, surely they would be referenced. I have a concern that nothing happened on many of them until the review of planning legislation, which I welcome. I would like to get to the bottom of that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	500	About 70 of the actions relate to the board - it has control over them. Of those, as we outlined, 36 have been actioned and completed. Of the remaining 34 actions, 21 have partial implementation. Again, maybe it is not detailed in this. As an example, we undertook some reviews of oral hearings. We undertook a review of our oral hearing processes. One of the recommendations set out in the report talked about treating the oral hearing process very much like the court, so you have grounds and legal papers.

Can I get a breakdown in tabular form of the costs relating to each case the board has lost or conceded over the past five years? That is breakdown per case. On the other side of the tab, I would like to know who were the board members who made the final decision. In other words, I want the case, the costs and the board members who made the final decision, in tabular form.

I have a real issue that is probably going under the radar. It relates to competency in EU law. There are five planning cases from Ireland at the Court of Justice at the moment and another three on the way. They all relate to the interpretation of the environmental impact assessment directive or the habitats directive. That is eight cases. It is quite an expensive situation for us. Why is the board's decision-making not able to give proper effect to EU law to avoid these scenarios? Has the board enough competency? Is there a deficiency in knowledge of EU law? Is there a requirement for training internally? This is seismic and is going to cost a lot of money. Dare I say it, many of these cases could be lost. Why is it happening so often? Is there a deficiency in capacity within the board? Why are these not being intercepted so the actual directives are being interpreted directly?

It is something that was very much in the mind of the Attorney General in the context of the planning review. Obviously, the board is working in the legislative frame that binds it. We were before the Oireachtas joint committee recently on the question of environmental assessment. One of the aspects we are looking at is that the new legislation would have all of the environmental piece in one part with clear signposting. That would be to ensure we are transposing things correctly, it has the constitutional public participation requirements and it is clear for future-proofing with regard to anything that comes from the court. From a skills perspective, we have obviously had a lot of legislation, including new functions in the marine area, going to the board so the nature of the skills required on an ongoing basis is something we have discussed with it.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	523	One brief question.

It is on the record anyway. One of the submissions turned out to be fictitious, if the witnesses remember that. It got all the way up to the end of the planning process. This was acknowledged. In fairness, An Bord Pleanála responded to the issue at the time. To me, that means the decision-making process is not correct, because a component of that decision was something that should never have got through. As a result, the hotel ended up not being built in south Kerry and many people did not end up with jobs. It had a dramatic impact on a small community. This has been well reported on. What has happened since then to make sure that can never happen again? What changes have been made?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	527	When we communicate with people who make an observation, we need their contact details, name and address. We send correspondence back to them to acknowledge it. If the correspondence is returned, it is a sign that it may be the wrong address or that there may be another issue. We would pursue it. We often send three or four letters as reminders, sometimes in registered post. If there are no responses and nothing can be delivered, we have to make a call about whether that is a valid observation. That is the normal practice generally. In the case the Deputy is referring to, without going into details, that was not the only observation on that particular case.

I want to come back to a few points that others have raised. I sought the terms of reference and An Bord Pleanála sent them to me. The first paragraph states that recent media reports have raised a number of matters relating to conflicts of interest which have potentially arisen in decisions on particular case types, certain other matters relating to the operation of two-person boards, and general procedures relating to the allocation of case files and amendments to inspectors' reports. Will the witnesses clarify what case types are concerned? I know it includes mobile phone masts. Does it include SHDs or other particular case types?

It will not come to me until it has its findings. That includes telecommunications masts and SHDs. It may include any other issues that have been written in and brought to our attention.

Mr. Walsh described a case of a mobile phone mast where he had set the procedures. My understand was that once that decision has been made, it is open-ended about that particular type of development. Section 108(1B) of the Planning and Development Act states:The resolution referred to in subsection (1A) shall specify the functions of the Board or division of the Board which may be performed in a meeting with a quorum of 2 and the period of time during which the specified functions may be performed.That certainly does not indicate to me that it is open-ended, but that it is time-limited. Is it time-limited? Has a review happened? What is Mr. Walsh's reading of the situation?

Mr. Walsh described where he grew up. I know what he is saying. It is not really open to interpretation when a person lives somewhere. Mr. Walsh said it is up to the individual board member to declare that conflict. What oversight is there to make sure that happens and there is quality control?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	552	Section 150 is where the code of conduct goes beyond the legislative requirements. It states, for the avoidance of doubt and in order to preserve this, that anyone who thinks there might be a conflict either with a location or, more likely, a connected person, should raise the matter with a board member.

It cannot be left to the individual. Organisations need systems to make sure they have some level of quality control in case somebody does not raise an issue. The system needs to make sure that does not happen.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	556	One safeguard is the fact that it is not just one person making the decision. That does not address the Deputy's particular question. Board members are probably involved in 500 to 700 cases each over the course of the years. Cases might involve someone who is not a direct family member, who a board member worked with, or who lived in a house 5 miles away. It requires trust and responsibility. This is where the code comes in.

Maybe these reviews and inquiries will show that. Regarding changes to planning law, such as to SHDs, what interaction does An Bord Pleanála have with the Department?

As was announced, we generally provide information and data based on the cases that we are dealing with. We do not advise and we do not recommend changes.Where there are case law issues that might be of relevance to failings in the legislative system, we can flag those.

A big change happened straight after that, in December 2016, in that it ceased to be the planning appeals board for some cases. I predicted in the Dáil at the time that there was only place that people would go.

I asked Mr. Walsh whether he saw a flaw in that system, or something to that effect, but he did not see that was the case when he was last in with us. SHDs are being phased out. We saw a new one the other day because we had some interaction, which surprised me because I thought there was a hard deadline, but obviously not. If we look at the profile of SHDs and judicial reviews, we can see that it escalated once the opportunity for people to appeal was taken away. Does Mr. Walsh not see in retrospect that that changed the dynamic completely and that it was a major flaw? Would he not have alerted Government to that being a major problem?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	564	We have a performance delivery agreement with the Department where we report monthly and annually on activities and the budget elements. The Department is well aware of the number of judicial reviews with which we are dealing and the costs associated with those, because they feature in our annual reports and budgets. With regard to the Deputy's fundamental question about whether SHDs have been shown to be flawed, it is not question for the board because the board implements whatever Government and Oireachtas policy is. We had the same issue when SID came in back in 2007. There were many judicial reviews as the legislation was being tested. The difference is that there might have been one or two cases per year that would have been impacted by those decisions. In the intervening period of making judicial reviews and having judgments, we are seeing 50 or 60 cases, which reflects the fact there are multiple judicial reviews and concessions.

I believe 70,000 units were given permission and 13,000 have been completed. SHDs are a minor part of adding to the costs of delivery of houses. It is to do with demand and controlling markets.

In his opening statement, he said:I can confirm that the board considers itself generally in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.The Department has the Remy Farrell examination, there is the An Bord Pleanála internal review, the Planning Regulator is carrying out an examination, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, is dealing with complaints, and Dublin City Council has asked for all its applications to be reviewed, although I do not wish to comment any further on that. I recognise things will be challenged, but given the length, breadth and depth of all this, how has An Bord Pleanála got itself into this position?

We saw them here last year. Some of the members may only have had an opportunity to have a look at the briefing material the evening before the meeting last May, and they would have spotted them and raised some of these issues at the time. I would have raised some of them. Does Mr. Walsh accept that the warning signs should have been seen sooner? It is a long list of examinations, reviews and investigations. Does he accept that?

There is strategic infrastructure, strategic housing and normal planning appeals, which are general cases. As the chair of the SID, I assign the cases to board members of strategic infrastructure cases, on a random basis, depending on who has capacity.

It did not raise a red flag. I asked Mr. Walsh how an Bord Pleanála had got itself into this situation. The average is 10% of the inspectors' cases being overruled or changed by the board. That is fine. Up to 20% would seem grand, but this is 90%. There is an average of 10% and, in certain cases dealing with a certain type of infrastructure and certain individuals making decisions, a situation is reached where it is 90%. That would not just be a red flag. There would be a red light flashing all over the room. No one in the board saw it.

The first is understanding the context for this issue. More important, from my perspective and that of the organisation, is how we ensure we identify this issue if it arises again. How do we provide the regular format that is not in place at the moment?If there are controls that are not in place, they should be in place. That is how we can strengthen this.

It would be quite normal in an organisation, such as a sporting organisation perhaps doing inquiries, a political organisation, a company or whatever that one would flip them around. On the number of people who are handed files and the number of people dealing with them, three seems normal. Mr. Walsh outlined that. Mr. Walsh said that in certain cases it can be less than that but for strategic infrastructure, it would always be three.

We are dealing with a hypothetical. If evidence comes to my attention that there are meetings that are taking place that should not be taking place, I will have to take action on it.

In 2018, the legal fees were €1.2 million. In 2021, they are €8.4 million. That is exceptional. Much of that relates to the strategic housing developments, which are now history and which, I believe, were an awful imposition altogether and were put together on a false basis that somehow the planning process could not be speeded up at local authority level. Does the board envisage an increase in legal fees as a result of the multiplicity of examinations and investigations I mentioned and the potential outworkings of that? Does Mr. Walsh envisage an increase in legal fees over the next year or two? As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am interested in this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	629	I suppose the issue is the legal fees primarily arise in relation to judicial reviews. If people take a judicial review, the board, obviously, has to seek its own advice. That is not directly within the board's control.

Mr. Walsh has said that An Bord Pleanála does not have an internal legal person and that it must go outside. I am sure the board, if I was sitting in Mr. Walsh's seat, would be looking for legal advice on a daily basis regarding the multiplicity of investigations and examinations.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	633	I foresee that obviously, we have relied on our legal advisers to provide specific advice in relation to elements of the review and other aspects of it, and that is a cost. Whether it actually ultimately adds to and increases the overall costs for this year or next year, I cannot say until I see the overall. However, there will be an additional cost over and above the normal legal costs that we would have.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	641	As far as I understand it, we have not. As you can see from the legal figures, they can go up and down substantially depending on the number of cases we have. In terms of legal advice, just to give you a sense, non-judicial general advice cost the board €57,000 in 2019. In 2020, it came to just under €62,000. In 2021, it was €91,000. That is the scale and level of the costs.

They could be held up with parliamentary duties or other committee duties. If they appear, I must give them their ten minutes. I propose we proceed in the speaking order, maybe, with four minutes each, and see how we get on. Is that agreed? Agreed. I call Deputy Carthy, who was first.

We were talking about the issues of the challenges and the areas that have been points of concern. I want to give an example of a case. As this case has concluded, there is no issue. It is in relation to a telecommunications mast in my own constituency that I am aware of in a small village called Glaslough. Monaghan County Council refused planning permission for that. I have the 12-page report, which is available in the public domain, as to the rationale for that. An Bord Pleanála sent its inspector - no doubt an eminently qualified inspector - to adjudicate on that decision when that decision was appealed by the telecommunications company. The inspector produced a detailed 34-page report upholding the decision of Monaghan County Council. Then An Bord Pleanála - I am not sure whether it was one person, two people or three people made this decision - compiled what could be generously described as a four-page report - there are lots of blanks. I can tell Mr. Walsh, having read both of these others, there is no way that anybody could understand what rationale the board had for overturning that. It cites Acts but does not indicate which aspects of those Acts are responsible. It states in this-----

At a previous meeting with the committee, Mr. Walsh acknowledged that board members will most likely never have set foot in the general area about which they are making a decision. Mr. Walsh has said anyone can write to the board. I am not making a judgment one way or another in respect of the application but could anyone who might have a concern about that decision know there was a potential that the people who made this decision also happened to have been a part of 75% of decisions where the inspector's report was overturned? How would anyone know there may be allegations in respect of the connections of some of those board member with telecommunications companies? There are only two sets of people who have the capacity to do that. One is investigative journalists.

There are only two sets of people who have the capacity to learn of those anomalies. One is investigative journalists. They did their job. The other is the Accounting Officer of An Bord Pleanála. I must ask again, in the context of the myriad allegations that have now brought An Bord Pleanála into the turmoil it is in and the disrepute that has been brought on the entire Irish planning system, does Mr. Walsh accept he failed in his job as Accounting Officer? Does he accept he failed not only on this point but potentially on hundreds of cases that could lead to tens of millions in legal costs down the line?

There is also a 34-page inspector's report as to why permission should be refused. There is then a four-page decision of the board overturning both of those decisions with virtually no rationale included. That is what is publicly available, to be clear.

All of the associated documentation that goes with that, which is not published on the website, is fully available.

Why did Mr. Walsh not do that?

I have never seen anything like how scant it is and yet Mr. Walsh says all the information is publicly available. The names of the inspector and the board member are included. There is a description of the case type, which might state "normal planning". There is a bare sentence for everything. There are references to split votes, with an option for "Yes" and "No". If there was a split vote, there is an opportunity to include the relevant ratio. There are other sections that include "Discussion" and "Refusal for oral hearing". There is nothing else. The website does not state why there was a refusal for an oral hearing. I ask Mr. Walsh not to clap himself on the back. He has a body of work to do and he would want to start doing it because as far as I am concerned, there is no trust and confidence in An Bord Pleanála. There is absolutely none. There is nothing transparent about what the board is doing, I am afraid to say. I have a question for Mr. Walsh. At his most recent appearance before the committee, he conceded there were no such thing as minimum density developments in legislation. Is that correct?

It is contended by the Planning Regulator, however, that there are such minimum densities. I spent 20 minutes on a Zoom call with the Planning Regulator who insisted there were such minimum densities but was unable to point me towards them anywhere. The Wexford county development plan has been framed and minimum densities have been inserted. We are talking about saving the public and getting value for money for the taxpayer. We have two arms of the State, that is, the two main statutory bodies dealing with planning. One states there are minimum density requirements and the other states there are not. As the Secretary General of the Department, does Mr. Doyle feel an obligation to bring that to somebody's attention in order that we do not have to defend judicial review proceedings and waste the taxpayers' money, given that we know about it?

The Office of the Planning Regulator, in looking at the situation, sees whether that "having regard" reflects the national planning framework, the regional strategies and the overall approach of increasing densities to ensure value for money and compact growth. In the context of the planning review, we are looking at ensuring clarity about which guidelines are mandatory and which are discretionary. That goes to the point.

The buck stops with him in terms of making sure these things are in place. Some of it is open to individuals having the integrity to declare while other things were not spotted. This screams of systems failure.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	758	I appreciate we had the discussion earlier and the Deputy was not happy but the system is based on personal responsibility and integrity in the first instance. When an organisation of the scale of the board, which is not a large organisation but deals with a significant volume of cases and large complex cases, there must be a certain level of trust within the system, but the system must then back it up in asking what spot checks and controls are in place. Where we can identify weaknesses in those, and we will not be shy in taking action on foot of any reviews by us or through the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, we can strengthen and provide that level of confidence.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	760	No, it is not because the OPR has a statutory role to oversee the board. The OPR announced in March or early April that it was undertaking a review of the board's systems and procedures as part of its second wave of local authority reviews. The OPR has done five or six of them. It has scheduled the review for the latter half of next year. That would have looked at the board's systems and procedures and given us a review of best practice. Because of what has happened, it has front-loaded some elements of that relating to certain aspects. I expect that this review will probably kick off some time in the next couple of months.

The legislative requirements are there. In the context of the code of conduct, where a case arises at a particular board meeting, that is when the initiative kicks in around raising the matter and either absenting oneself from the meeting or seeking a ruling as to whether a conflict does exist from the chairperson.

Mr Walsh has said to me that nothing was seen, nothing unusual jumped out. What is the big failure there? Who is failing? Is it the board? Is it Mr. Walsh? Is it the secretary of the board? Where is the failure?

Who assigned those members to those boards?

Generally, it is a discussion that may take place in respect of the volume of cases that board members might have and their capacity to deliver in respect of them. The actual assignment of individual cases is done by the administrative team.

If there is any advice or consultation that the administrators might have, that is generally kind of where it is dealt with.

I would have thought that, as a matter of course, if I was up before the Committee of Public Accounts and I made a declaration on several occasions in respect of an issue - in this instance that cases are assigned on a randomised basis - the first thing I would have done when I went back to the office would be to ask somebody to make sure that was actually the case. Mr. Walsh did not do that. Is that not his evidence? He has not at any point up until this current review carried out an assessment as to whether the assertions he is making to the Committee of Public Accounts are factual.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	811	Regarding the process that the board has, the legislation gives the responsibility to the chair or deputy chair to allocate, but it is assigned to administrative teams to manage that process. In the context of the Deputy's question as to whether this has been checked, verified or otherwise, I had no reason to question the procedures that are in place. Until such time as somebody wrote in or highlighted the issue----
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	812	You did. In one instance, there was a situation, as the Chairman correctly outlined, where inspectors' reports were increasingly being disallowed or overturned by a board in respect of a particular type of development at a huge scale. This was unprecedented, as far as I can make, out in terms of the board previously having made decisions. Mr. Walsh had a couple of reasons. He was making the assertion to the Committee of Public Accounts very strongly. All of a sudden, his inspectors' reports were being rejected on a massive scale. There were communities the length and breadth of the country stating that the decisions were unfair and were not based on proper, adequate rationale. There was all of the rationale to carry out even a paper assessment as to whether what he was asserting to the Committee of Public Accounts was true and Mr. Walsh did not do that. Is that not correct?

When we have a large volume of cases. My job is to ensure that these cases are assigned efficiently and spread out across the board according to capacity in each area.

It was not something Mr. Walsh discovered, which basically means he does not have any checks in place. If the board has a two-member quorum, who takes the minutes?

I was just saying that if Mr. Walsh was seeking to investigate what Deputy Carthy is talking about and went back to the minutes, he would not be able to do so.

I will return to Plean-IT. Mr. Walsh said earlier that it was €5.4 million of cost that has been running ongoing since 2014, yet it is still not complete. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	859	Yes, it is an evolving project because we are adding new functionality to it. The cost for the original project was to get it to a point in 2018. It went live in 2017 but it did not fulfil all of its requirements.

Of that €5.4 million, how much of that amount is for the consultancy element of it and the ongoing maintenance of that particular IT system?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	870	Of the €5.397 million, €4.04 million would be consumable. This is running systems, consultation, training, and anything that is non-capital. Capital spend came in at €1.347 million. This is to do with functionality. That is the actual build.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	871	That is fine. That explains the breakdown of it. I have another question to ask in my remaining minute. With all of the changes between the strategic housing developments, SHDs, that were brought in and the strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs, there was a requirement - of which I was critical at the time - that An Bord Pleanála was not equipped IT-wise for those changes. The interface between the public and An Bord Pleanála lacked a lot of improvement. It is good to see the changes on the website, which I have witnessed and which are important. The cost, however, is quite eye watering from my perspective. Yes, there is some consultancy in that but I ask that An Bord Pleanála would be conscious of that going into the next year. I would like a breakdown of the oral hearings. Earlier I asked about the inspectors' reports and how often these are overturned and overlooked. It seems to me that it is a shot in the dark whether or not an application goes to an oral hearing. What are the criteria for the board making a decision about an oral hearing? Is the quorum for that decision equally two or three members? I believe this would have ramifications if an oral hearing is granted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	872	If an appellant seeks a request for an oral hearing an inspector will examine the file and make a recommendation to the board as to whether she or he considers there is sufficient information on the file to enable her or him to make an assessment. Then that goes to the board for a decision. In the vast majority of cases the inspector's recommendation is carried through. On the Deputy's last question, for oral planning appeals an oral hearing request can be considered by a two-person meeting. As I said earlier to the Cathaoirleach, if there are any cases that relate to strategic infrastructure that require an environmental impact assessment, they cannot be dealt with by a two-person quorum.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	873	Does Mr. Walsh have a number for the oral hearings granted in 2019 or 2020?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	874	I can get a copy of those for the Deputy. Obviously, there are oral hearings that, while not considered mandatory, are considered part of the process in relation to strategic infrastructure. They can still be dispensed with. There is an option to do that under SHD and we have held a few oral hearings. With regard to other elements, I can come back to the Deputy with that.
#CormacDevlin	unknown-#CormacDevlin-party	unknown-#CormacDevlin-dob	unknown-#CormacDevlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	875	The anomaly for me is that if the inspector's report is to grant permission but there is also a need for an oral hearing, where does the quorum or the board sit on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	876	The board will first decide, before it goes any further, if an oral hearing is required.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	878	A file is returned to the inspector and the inspector will then continue the assessment. An oral hearing is assessed on the basis of all the information and all of the replies, including the points from the local authority and all parties, and if the inspector has enough information before him or her to be able to make a valid assessment.

In Mr. Walsh's time as the chairman of An Bord Pleanála have there been any instances where the number of people making those decisions has been fewer than three?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	880	In the past there has been one SID case where an oral hearing consideration was undertaken as part of a two-person quorum, as far as I understand it.

Again, for substantive discussions and any substantive decisions on strategic infrastructure it would be a minimum of three people, and is often four people for some of the larger cases.

Yesterday, the Planning and Development, Maritime and Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2022 went through Dáil Éireann. An amendment was proposed to be put in by the Government to allow An Bord Pleanála to change a decision after it was challenged by a judicial review. Is that correct? Was this the intention of the amendment? I was not following it exactly myself because I was tied up with work around this committee and various other things. Will Ms Graham clarify if this is correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	887	There were a number of amendments under consideration. I understand there are two amendments to the judicial review process being progressed through the Dáil at the moment. One is leave that the court would decide that all administrative processes have been complete, so that leave to appeal would depend on other factors too. For example, some cases for judicial review before the board may have gone for judicial review during the course, or maybe a couple of times during the course. This provision would be as envisaged in the Aarhus Convention, that the court is used after the local authority and the other appeals' routes have been exhausted.

That concludes the questions. I want to thank the witnesses for joining us today, and the staff of the board and of the Department - Mr. Doyle and Ms Graham - for preparing for today's meeting. I thank the officials of An Bord Pleanála. I want to thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, Ms Henry and their staff for the work that they have done.  Is it agreed to request the clerk to follow up information and carry out any agreed actions that arise from meeting? Agreed.  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefs that have been provided for today's meeting? Agreed.  There is some follow-up information to be forwarded to the committee.  The meeting is suspended and we will resume in private session at 1.30 p.m. before moving into public session. There are a few issues to deal with. We will do that at 1.30 p.m. We will then move straight into public session.

We will consider minutes, accounts, financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business. The minutes of the meeting of 7 July have been circulated to members. Do they wish to raise any matters arising from the minutes? If not, are the minutes agreed? Agreed. As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page. Moving to accounts and financial statements, we will consider a good few of these today. There were 13 sets of financial statements laid before the Houses between 30 June and 8 July. I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening to comments from the floor.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	906	The first set of financial statements for noting are the accounts of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and members will be glad to know it got a clear audit opinion. That is for 2021. The second set is from the Mental Health Commission, again for 2021, and this received a qualified audit opinion. The accounts, in my view, give a true and fair view, except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, and that is standard for many health bodies. It is in the nature of a technical qualification there and it is only qualified in regard to that point. There are nine sets of financial statements that come from the National Treasury Management Agency stable, if you like, and it has a very broad remit.The first one is the accounts of the national debt of Ireland for 2021. That received a clear audit opinion. The next one is the administration account for the National Treasury Management Agency. These are the expenses of the organisation. There is a clear audit opinion for 2021. Next is the Post Office Savings Bank Fund for 2021. It is a clear audit opinion. The State Claims Agency received a clear audit opinion for 2021, but I do draw attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control that there were a number of erroneous payments made in 2021 to service providers due to the agency's manual payment processing. The service providers returned the payment so there was no net loss, but still it was a control failing. Next is the Dormant Accounts Fund for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. The National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) for 2021 received a clear audit opinion, but that is a nil account where there is no balance in the account at the moment. No. 9 is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 10 is the National Pensions Reserve Fund. This is a fund that is now dissolved, and these are the final accounts for 2021. It received a clear audit opinion. The Ireland Apple Escrow Fund for 2021 received a clear audit opinion. Moving on from the NTMA accounts, No. 12 is the Child and Family Agency, also known as Tusla. For 2021 it received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to the disclosures that are made in the accounts on material non-compliant procurement and the implications for Tusla of the cyberattack on the HSE's ICT system. Tusla relies on support from the HSE for its ICT system. The next one is the Cork Education and Training Board. These are the financial statements for 2020. It received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to disclosures about material non-compliant procurement, which occurs in other ETBs. I also drew attention to significant delay and additional costs incurred by the board on a capital project for the building of an extension to one of its schools, due to the failure of the first appointed contractor in December 2017. Last week, when the Department of Education was here, Deputy Murphy drew attention to that kind of situation. There is another ETB coming forward where I draw attention to a similar problem. Undoubtedly, there is or has been an issue there. The final one for noting this week is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	912	Where it makes a payment in settlement of a claim, it typically recovers it from the agency in respect of whom the claim is made.

They relate to service unit staff etc. It states in the reply that the State Claims Agency does not disclose its contingent liability figures for reasons of litigation sensitivity for a particular series or cohort of similar claims. However, it does presumably have a contingent liability. I am slightly confused about the issue. Does each Department hand over responsibility to the State Claims Agency?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	916	If Deputy Murphy remembers the HSE's financial statements, it discloses its share of the contingent liability that is disclosed in the State Claims Agency account. It has a note in the accounts, but it does not make a provision for it. I cannot recall the figure offhand but if, let us say, the value of claims is €4 billion, what we might see is that €3.6 billion of that is reflected as a contingent liability in the HSE financial statements, because ultimately it will be passed back to it.

For the philanthropist to contribute, it must contribute to a charity for it to be tax deductible or whatever, and that might be the situation. Schools would typically be charities and a lot of third level institutions are registered as charities as well.

Could we agree to note the listings of financial statements? Agreed. As usual, the listing of the accounts of the financial statements will be published as part of our minutes. I will move on to correspondence. As previously agreed, items that are not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated. Decisions taken by the committee in regard to correspondence are published on the committee's web page and recorded in the minutes. The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B – correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers, and follow-up from committee meetings. The first is No. 1335. It is from Ms Rhonda Evans, communications manager, National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. It is dated 29 June 2022. It is an update on the previous recommendations made by the committee. At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Deputy Carthy requested that we hold it over for consideration today. Does he want to comment?

Their refusal to provide us with the documentation we have requested is equally not acceptable. I ask that we put this item on the clár when we return after the recess to assess whether there are other options available to the committee to get forthright answers, particularly from the Department of Health, which has overall responsibility. I do not know how we can have a long-term plan for our health services in the financial sense without knowing how much the biggest infrastructure project within that sector is going to cost us in the long run. This is something the committee is going to have to remain vigilant on.

Clearly, lessons have to be learned from this. We cannot have another open-ended situation like this where the State and the taxpayer are left exposed. We will note and publish that. We move on to item No. 1342 B, which is from Mr. David Gunning, chief executive officer of the National Children's Hospital. It came as a cover letter. Does Deputy Murphy wish to comment?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	935	I am unhappy about this. I specifically asked a question on whether there were other triggers. This goes to whether there can be counterclaims, at what point one would trigger a counterclaim and whether it is just at the end of the contract. They went through in some detail that they had to wait until all of it was completed before they could decide whether there was a counterclaim. We are being told something different here. On the day when they were before the committee, I asked them whether there were any other triggers and it was an immediate “No”. This is going back on that. The Comptroller and Auditor General can tell me if I am wrong, but my interpretation is there are opportunities to make counterclaims and there are other triggers. There is this moratorium where they have all started to be nice to each other to try to limit claims and, for that reason, they backed off putting in counterclaims. There are other triggers. Am I right in my interpretation of that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	936	“Yes” is the simple answer. I was surprised by the answer the Deputy was given at the meeting. I think there was a piece of correspondence which No. 1342 is correcting. I was surprised by that as well. We made some inquiries after last week's meeting and I think that is what prompted this week's letter, No. 1342. It reverses completely what was stated previously and does acknowledge there are potential triggers for claims by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, against the contractor.

I would have pursued that line and that is what I had intended to try to pursue. In contracts, there are often a range of different things and it is not just all the eggs in one basket at the end.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	938	The reason we went back was because we were aware there were provisions in there for what are called subsector triggers or claim points. We were already aware there were those in the thing.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	939	What would be an example of that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	940	To be honest, I have information that I got as part of the audit and it is not for me to come here and explain this. It is for the NPHDB to provide the information. I recall that, on an earlier occasion, the committee wrote quite a detailed letter to the NPHDB and one of the things it asked for was a copy of the clauses of the contract that deal with claims and counterclaims. My recollection is that when it responded to that, it gave other information but it did not give the committee the clauses.

During the engagement on 16 June, during Deputy Carthy's contribution, the chief officer stated that claims continue to come in during the moratorium. It would appear from the correspondence before us that while the contractor continues to make claims, even though they cannot be progressed through dispute resolution, the board has not done so. I propose we request clarity from the board on this. Witnesses are generally invited to assist us in examining their accounts. Although I could not be present at the meeting, I understand there was a poor level of engagement by the board with the committee and that was brought to the chief officer's attention. He committed to: “take it away and take note of it to consider how we can do better to fulfil these particular requirements.” The correspondence does not, to my mind, represent improvement in that regard. Members might also recall that we requested information from the board in regard to certain contractual provisions in advance of the engagement on 16 June, and that was not provided and no explanation was given on its omission. I suggest we reiterate that request, as well as seeking an explanation for the failure to provide the information to the committee. I would also suggest we afford the chief officer the opportunity to review the transcript of the meeting on 16 June to ensure he is satisfied that the information he has provided to the committee is entirely accurate. I want to make that point because I was not at the meeting, which was chaired by Deputy Murphy.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	943	I want them to tell us exactly what the other triggers are. The ultimate cost of this hospital will be determined by a number of things. It will also be determined by the number of counterclaims that can be made where they have not abided by their side of the contract. We have both been pursuing this particular line. I do not want a general letter like this. I want the specifics in regard to what those triggers are and there should be some detail in that. It is obviously things that are already gone. I would have pursued this in much more detail. It is very frustrating they can just send in a letter a couple of weeks later, yet we do not have the opportunity to expand on something when they are here and we are just writing to them to try to drag more information out of them. It is utterly unsatisfactory.

It is crystal clear to me that we are going to have to consider whether our work plan in the autumn includes another hearing with the board and the Department. It is not technical. This is a substantial issue. If there is a situation where, as I mentioned previously, the board and the Department are refusing to give an estimated final cost, then it is imperative that every other question is clarified, especially in regard to claims, because we know those claims are going to be a substantial part of whatever the final overrun is. Looking at the construction inflation costs announced today and where we are heading with this, the mind boggles as to where this project could finally end up, considering again the geniuses who signed off on this contract agreed the State would take the full hit for everything over and above 4%. We have a legitimate interest in pursuing these issues and I would consider that the board and the Department have an obligation to respond in a frank and forthright manner.

One is that we may need to bring the members of the board in before us in the not too distant future. My opinion is that given the nature of what we have witnessed in the past two years and the responses we are getting from the board, we should certainly keep that proposal under active consideration. We need to include it in the work programme with a question mark as to timing. It is not a question of whether we bring them back; it is a question of when we do so. It would crystallise the issues somewhat in terms of-----

This correspondence is very short and does not give us the kind of detail we need and that we would have got from the members of the board had they been in front of us. They need to give us the detail of what the other triggers are, apart from the completion date. I want that information in detail, including how many triggers there are, examples of them and that kind of thing, highlighting where this is set out as part of the contract. We probably have some of that information but they should be asked to provide it. Their role in coming in here was for us to hold them to account. If they do not give candid replies on issues as basic as this, it is very difficult to do that. Let us see what information we can get from them. There is no doubt that we must have them back in before us.

The next correspondence is 1341B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 4 July 2022, providing information requested by the committee regarding inflation in respect of the national home retrofit scheme. It is proposed to note the correspondence and publish it to the website. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Carthy flagged this correspondence.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	950	I welcome the correspondence. This is an issue that will become more prevalent in our work because the budget for retrofitting is going to increase as the climate action plan takes hold. It would be useful if we could get clarification from the Department on a number of issues, including the reallocation of €40 million of the carbon tax fund from retrofitting to the purchase of gas and diesel generators this winter. An update from the Department as to what impact that will have on the roll-out of the retrofitting programme would be helpful. I hope the Chairman can provide some clarification on a second matter. It would be useful if the committee could get a sense of how much of each local authority's housing stock continues to be serviced by solid fuel heating systems. There has been much debate about the regulations that are coming in this week. We have a situation where some publicly owned homes have stoves as the only means of heating the water and the home. This is the low-hanging fruit in terms of what needs to be done if we are serious about reducing the use of solid fuels. I know the local authorities are not accountable to us but can we write to each of them asking for that information? The Department responds to parliamentary questions saying the information is in the hands of the local authorities.

There are some census figures as well, although that information might not be included in the latest data. Many people with stoves are looking to hold on to them because of the price of electricity and gas. However, I take the Deputy's point and we will seek that information from the Department.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	952	Some local authorities are providing grants for stoves.

However, if it is done as part of a full retrofit, people will take the opportunity. If their stove is taken out to put in a gas boiler, they will naturally be wary.

Unfortunately, they are generally the homes whose inhabitants are on the lowest household income. People are caught in a catch-22 situation. We will request that information. The next correspondence is 1345B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 6 July 2022, providing information requested by the committee regarding the overall expenditure to date on the national maternity hospital project. It is proposed to note the correspondence and publish it to the website. Is that agreed? Agreed. It caught my eye that from 2014 to 2022, there was a sum total of €95.3 million spent on the national maternity hospital. I do not know whether there is a plan for construction and what the situation is regarding the site, the legalities and so on. There was a deal signed off recently. I do not know whether any of the members or the Comptroller and Auditor General can help me out on this. I can understand why there would be survey costs and that various different consultants had to be brought in to do different pieces of work, but nearly €100 million has been spent and I have not even seen a drawing. How does one spend €100 million and not even have the JCBs on site, as I often say? In fact, this amount was spent before we even had the deal for the site signed. It is an incredible sum of money. Can Mr. McCarthy shed any light on it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	960	I can shed a bit of light. The letter indicates that a new pharmacy was built. I understand the pharmacy for the hospital is on the site where the new hospital is to be built. That had to be removed first and a new pharmacy built to serve the whole campus. That was one aspect of it. The second issue, I understand, was that some of the car park space is being used to enable the building. That was being made ready and the car park had to be extended. Those are things that had to be done before the hospital could be built.

Obviously, the pharmacy would still be used and there would be a question of whether the existing pharmacy still had life in it. There would have been a value for money question if the construction did not go ahead on the site.

This means that if there is €95 million spent in total, there is about €40 million on planning and design. It seems like a lot for a project that did not have a site.

The pharmacy has been built on the roof of the existing block and it is on private land.

We certainly need to query the difference between the cost of the pharmacy and the car parking and what else has been spent. We need to get more detail on that.Another thing jumps out at me from the letter. We have just been talking about something very similar. It states:As the construction contracts for a number of these works are ongoing, the individual contract costs are commercially sensitive and therefore are not broken out separately.Somebody will be back here again talking about this. I am always very nervous about round figures. The €1 billion cost has been chucked around the place. It started off being €300 million. We have not seen any designs. We do not know what the budget is. The figure escalated from €300 million to €800 million and the figure being talked about at the moment is €1 billion. This is not on a difficult site like the children's hospital.

If the work is done, where is the commercial sensitivity? It is the same with the car park. If that was a separate budget for those enabling works in the car park, and there is roughly €50 million for the two of those, I cannot see any reason they cannot provide us with the cost of both of those projects if they were separate or even a separate annex to the main contract. The main contract is not even signed so they had to be stand-alone contracts. Why would they not be able to give us that? Why would that be commercially sensitive?

There was a little bit of other work like road realignment, diversion of utilities and treatment for aspergillus, which is a site-specific issue. Certainly, it is open to the committee to ask why it cannot have details of the costs of individual projects.

It is not that long ago that we had a piece of correspondence that talked about learning lessons from previous projects. I cannot remember where it came from but it jumped out at me. Would we have the benefit of learning lessons for this hospital from the children's hospital? It is not obvious how we learn lessons if the process is opaque, which this appears to be.

I want to link it to the ongoing conversations we have been having regarding the national paediatric hospital. Up to this point, it appears that no lessons have been learned, even from the debates we had around the signing of the contracts, which many people continue to feel will have long-term repercussions in itself. Even the fact that works were carried out on the site before the State actually signed those contracts appears dubious. It reminds me of the time when I was on the council and the majority was voting to privatise the bin services. It turned out that before a decision had even been made, the private companies had already left the bins everywhere; a decision had been made. I was struck by something when Mr. McCarthy cited the €50 million cost of a pharmacy. I imagine that the-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	979	Yes, and other ancillary works.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	980	It would be helpful if we were able to find out the cost of the private hospital that is being built in Spain that will cater for the people we are shipping over there because of the health services. I imagine it will probably compare fairly favourably with the pharmacy we have in Dublin. This committee has a role to play and this follows on from Deputy Catherine Murphy's point. We need to get clarification in the here and now, from both the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as to what measures and provisions they are putting in pre-contract and pre-tender to ensure we can say, in the same way almost anybody else in the world can, that when a contract is signed, this is how much the project will cost. It does not need to be kept secret if it is defined in the contract, or if there are provisions that say it will potentially go to this cost if X, Y and Z happen or it could be less if A, B and C happen. That is the way contracts are supposed to work when we are talking about construction. We did not have that in respect of the national paediatric hospital. That is why we are still figuring out three quarters of the way through building it how much it will actually cost. It has not happened in far too many other areas so it must happen here. If it does not, and we end up in a situation where the Committee of Public Accounts in ten or 15 years is having the same conversations about this hospital as we are about the national paediatric hospital, one will have to say it is time to bloody take down the whole system and start again.

In light of the saga of the paediatric hospital, however, it is totally valid for us to ask what the clauses are in the tender, how that tender process is working and what we can do in that regard. When it comes to the numbers that are being bandied around, and I put this to the Minister at the time at the Joint Committee on Health, the proposed building is 55,000 sq. m. Health buildings at the moment cost approximately €5,000 per sq. m. Even with massive inflation, we are talking about a base cost of approximately €275 million. If we add in, let us say, one third for commissioning and one third for fees, we are still nowhere near €800 million, which is what we were talking about at the time of the decision-making. I do not know where we got to €1 billion, but even €800 million was a huge inflation. I do not know how we got there. When I put that to the Minister, I really got no answer to that. It was said that is what had been reported in the media. I would really like to understand this. I know the decision has been made now. I believe it has all been signed off from a project quality index point of view. At the time of the decision, however, the business case had not been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It had been set out but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform refused it and sent it back. I would love to understand and it would be really important for the Committee of Public Accounts to understand where the business case is right now. Has it been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform? What is that situation? There is an issue around spending when there has been no agreement. That is terrible in terms of public money and governance. I do not think we should ever accept that. To spend €50 million or €90 million - we are not even taking the number seriously now because it is all just a figure in taxpayers' money - when we do not have an agreement in place is atrocious. Finally, if we are going back to the Department of Health to ask for information, particularly now that we are talking about Spanish hospitals and stuff, as I did at the time I would like to flag the fact that a scoping exercise for the maternity hospital was done on the Elm Park site in 2012. There is a fully built hospital that has been empty for ten years sitting on the Elm Park site. My understanding is that the scoping exercise found it was suitable for a maternity hospital. The National Maternity Hospital did that scoping exercise and it found that it was suitable for a maternity hospital and for its needs. I would love to see that report and for the Department of Health to release that report in order that we could see that scoping exercise. My understanding is that the building is still empty.

A number of issues have been raised, which, in no particular order, are the business case for the maternity hospital and the report published on the hospital that was built at Elm Park that is still completely vacant. There is also the breakdown of the figures regarding the pharmacy, car park and ancillary works that are being carried out. The question was also raised as to whether ancillary works were carried out on the car park prior to the final signing of the legal agreement this year.

Not to add to the Chairman's work but could we get clarity from the Department on whether any agreements are signed without the business plan being agreed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	984	Okay. I will add to that the status of the tender at the moment and the clauses in it. I thank everybody for that very comprehensive discussion. The next item of correspondence is 1350B, from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.It is dated 7 July. It provides information requested by this committee regarding the digitisation of the Land Commission records, including information concerning turf plots etc. Those are all contained there. It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this item. 
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-07-14 00:00:00	2020 Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts	985	I raised this matter initially because it is a bugbear of mine. I thank the Secretary General for the comprehensive reply. I can see some of the issues involved, including the sheer scale of the information which exists. This is precisely the issue I was trying to draw attention to. If we compare our approach in the Republic to that taken in Northern Ireland, it is possible to walk into the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, PRONI, which is in a lovely new building constructed in the Titanic Quarter, and to look at the Land Commission records there. They are not digitised, but it is possible to go in and to look at them. We have a 100-year rule on records but these documents seem to be an exception to this rule. The Department has said that these are working records and fragile. This is all the more reason, though, for why they would be digitised. This is a useful item of correspondence but I still think we should respond in turn and ask why we do not have a similar approach to these records, in the context of the 100-year rule not applying, and why there is a different approach in Northern Ireland to making the Land Commission's records there available. I ask this question because this information is a treasure trove. These are working documents for some people but they are also an important genealogical set of records.

We will note and publish the item of correspondence. No. 1353 B is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 11 July, providing information requested by the committee arising from a meeting with representatives of the Department on 19 May 2022. Information across a range of areas is included. Also included is a review of the business case for the Department’s funding of Benefacts. I suggest we deal with this item in conjunction with further correspondence we have received from Benefacts itself, which is R1346 C. These two items then are No. 1353 B and R1346 C. I will introduce this correspondence before opening it to the floor. At our meeting of 30 June, we agreed to request the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to clarify, among other things, whether it is aware of the extent to which other Departments use Benefacts data. In its correspondence, Benefacts set out 94 instances of data provision to public, private and non-profit bodies between 2016 and 2021. Regarding its funding, the organisation has stated that it proposed that it be funded under the Teckal procurement exemption. The committee has been provided with a copy of the advice regarding the feasibility of instituting these arrangements from the professional firm that prepared it. Benefacts states that its board received no response to its proposal from the Department, nor was there any other opportunity to discuss alternative institutional, financial and governance arrangements. It goes on to state that:Senior officials in the Department of Rural & Community Development advised Benefacts that they would not consider taking over responsibility for funding the company because they regarded Benefacts as a source of “massive procurement risk” [...] Notwithstanding this, the Department appears to have asked Pobal to explore the feasibility of providing a service that is on the face of it very similar to one of those already developed, tested and launched by Benefacts [...] even though of course Pobal is a provider to the State of what are by definition public goods under the Teckal exemptionIt is proposed to note and publish this correspondence and to request the consent of Benefacts to also publish its correspondence. Is that agreed? Agreed. I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.

There is a difference between a public good and a market good. Looking at the organisations that have used these data, including the Central Statistics Office, CSO, I would have thought there is a strong argument that this endeavour is a public good. Therefore, we should seek the response that Benefacts could not get from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Regarding the last paragraph of the correspondence in question, it relates to the same aspect of a market good. We should ask the Department of Rural and Community Development how it determined that work of Benefacts was a market good as opposed to a public good. We should undertake these two actions. It was useful to get the information from Benefacts concerning the range of possible uses in this regard. They are comprehensive. We should also send the Greenville report that Benefacts commissioned to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and ask for its comments on it.

Is that agreed? Agreed. We will note and publish this correspondence. We move to category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. The first item is No. 1347 C from Deputy Catherine Murphy, dated 7 July, and provides information to the committee in the form of a response to a parliamentary question relating to RTÉ's legal costs and settlements. The Deputy includes a related proposal. Does the Deputy wish to address the item?

Some of this relates to the Eversheds report. There is a second Eversheds report, which relates to the actors in "Fair City". We should ask RTÉ to provide us with that report and whether an in-house legal team was used to deal with this matter or if it was a legal team from outside. We should also ask what the cost of this undertaking was and whether the findings have fed into RTÉ paying additional PRSI contributions. We know what they were in the context of the first Eversheds report, but there is also a second Eversheds report.

We will note and publish this correspondence and we will seek that extra information. Next is No. 1348 C, from me, and this is a proposal to include an engagement with representatives of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, in our work programme. We will be deciding on that programme, so I just want to flag this proposal and I do not wish to open it for discussion now. It is a short and concise letter but it will be understood what I am asking for in it. No other items of correspondence have been flagged.  We move on to the work programme. Last week, we agreed that our first meeting in September would deal with correspondence and any other business of the committee that might accumulate over the summer recess. We have the item in respect of value for money. We also agreed to schedule an engagement with Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, to examine the 2020 financial statements the following week. Additionally, we also requested a representative of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to attend the meeting. To assist the secretariat in planning the meeting, do the members wish a representative of the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, IHRB, to attend the meeting as well?

Following that, we will engage with the HSE to examine expenditure on mental health services. We may hold another meeting with the HSE to focus on expenditure on emergency services, in particular ambulance services. I suggest we firm up this. We definitely need to do an examination with the HSE of expenditure on emergency and ambulance services given what is happening at present. We have had discussions whereby a big budget is going in but the services are not happening at the other end.

We can have the Department in with it. Another option would be to include other bodies that are accountable to the committee and have responsibility for emergency services. If that is preferable I will ask the secretariat to put together a proposal for consideration. It is up to members how we proceed with this. My feeling is that the HSE is very big, as are each of these areas. Dealing with ambulance services and emergency services on the same day will be a lot. If we try to broaden it out any further we will get lost and we will not have an opportunity to deal with it properly. What are the views of the members on this?

It is not necessary for us to spend time discussing it. On his appointment, he issued a public statement indicating that he was waiving a portion of his salary.

If it is not answered by the date of the meeting, I have no problem with it being raised as a specific issue. That will take five minutes. It is an answer we have been trying to get for a while. I hope we will not need to raise it and that there will be clarity by way of correspondence before then. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has been mentioned. We could include it between the two health engagements. We had three meetings on justice in a row, with the Department, the Prison Service, An Garda Síochána and Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. I thought that worked very well. It is the choice of the committee. We will have meetings on mental health services, the ambulance service and emergency services. These are big pieces of work.

I expect it to be completed at the end of August. It will then go to the Department.

That is useful. As mentioned, if the committee is agreeable, I suggest adding to the work programme for the autumn further engagement with the SEAI. A great deal is happening with retrofits and energy upgrades. A lot of money is involved. It is a growth industry and the State is playing a big part in it. This is all good but we need to have a look at it to see what is happening. Is that agreed? Agreed. We will schedule that in the autumn programme.

We can put it on the list but not schedule it.

I thank the Deputy. As discussed last week, we are looking to plan ahead. As members are aware, the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2021 report on accounts for public services will be available to us at the end of September. We might want to prioritise further areas for examination once we have sight of it. Do members wish to raise any other matters?

It goes back to the fact that, unfortunately, the committee ran foul of the work it was doing. It is with regard to the amount of money being paid out by the HSE to the various section 38 and 39 organisations. New procedures were put in place in this regard. Since the issue arose a number of years ago have we gone back and looked over these organisations? Between €4.5 billion and €5 billion is paid out to approximately 2,500 organisations. Is it worth looking at it again at some stage? I am not saying immediately but at some stage over the coming six months.

It is difficult because there are 2,500 organisations receiving funding. In fairness, the Committee of Public Accounts identified an issue previously. Perhaps it did not come out of the courts on the right side but at the same time this does not mean it is an issue we should park.

It provides an update every year on how it refines its systems. If the committee wanted additional information on aspects, or perhaps a clearer update on recommendations made by the committee previously, it could request that of the HSE and it would be available when its representatives come before it.

We will continue with the practice of trying to schedule matters well ahead of people coming before us because it allows the secretariat to be able to line up people. Sometimes witnesses say they are not available or it does not suit them. Body A might not be able to come in on a certain day but we could move to body B. It is useful to try to plan a bit of a distance out. I will speak to the new clerk about that and trying to get those kinds of procedures in place. We want to ensure we deal with what the committee members want, along with dealing with the reports that might be scheduled throughout the autumn.

The committee was trying to reschedule the discussion with the Central Bank and Revenue Commissioners about a specific account. The representatives from the Central Bank were not available but they offered to return in the autumn. That is another one to try to get into the programme.

I thank everybody for their work. I know it will not be a complete break because when this places closes, members need to give their constituencies more attention. Staff are on holidays and we must make up the shortfall. I hope, in between, members get a good break and enjoy it. Much work has been put in. It is the same for the staff, including those in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office. I thank them for their efforts. Have a happy and safe summer.
