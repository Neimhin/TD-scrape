        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_1">
          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I propose to deal with these topics separately and I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.</p>

        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Deputy Seymour Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise an urgent matter of local and national importance, namely, the fact that more Garda personnel need to be made available in the Border region in light of the serious crime being carried out at present.  Recently, two ATM machines were taken out of the walls in Cootehill on the one night.  Only a few months earlier, this happened to the ATM of one of the banks in the town.  Efforts have been made to take out the ATM machines in Clones and Smithborough.  The local co-op store's safe was also stolen and the same thing is happening along the Border in counties Armagh, Tyrone and Fermanagh.  It is vital that the group responsible be apprehended and dealt with; otherwise, the money may be used for subversive activities at a major cost to the nation.  This issue is urgent and must be dealt with.  The PSNI and Garda are working together very closely.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_3">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to debate the fact that participants on community employment schemes are having their wages cut by 5.5% in comparison to those in receipt of the jobseeker's allowance in the same age group, whose cut is to be 4.1%; the fact that this makes a mockery of the Government's claim that it is encouraging people to retrain and seek new employment; and the fact that it will represent a significant drop in income for people who are already struggling to make ends meet.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the fact that despite the havoc and destruction of property that resulted from the recent flooding, especially in Athlone, south Longford and other parts of the midlands, the Government is dragging its feet when it comes to parting with the funding for victims.  Less than 5% of the €10 million earmarked for flood relief has been paid out and farmers, businessmen and private householders are in urgent need of assistance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_6">Ba mhaith liom an Dáil a chur ar athló chun déileáil le ceist rí-thábhachtach, namely, the urgent need for the Government to reverse the illogical decision to close many community drugs projects, CDPs, among them the Vista CDP in Donore Avenue, the Matt Talbot project in Ballyfermot, the Links project in Cherry Orchard, the Ballyfermot Traveller action project, the Crumlin CDP, Blaney Blades in Castleblayney and Mulhuddart CDP, which is to close at the end of the year.  Coupled with recent cuts in funding to RAPID, cuts by the Department of Education and Science with a promise to close fully in 2010 Peer Education, Familyscope, the family resource centre, James's Street, Mater Dei Early Focus project, Basin Lane, the 62% reduction in funding to tackle educational disadvantage, cuts to community employment and job initiative schemes and the cuts in social welfare, the cuts to CDPs will exacerbate the problems of many of the people who previously availed of these local services, in addition to communities who have been striving to regenerate and address major societal issues in areas designated as severely disadvantaged.  There is a need for a more realistic appeals timeframe to ensure these groups can survive and deliver the services required in the areas in which they work.</p>

          <p eId="para_7">I wish to seek the adjournment of the Dáil to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to protect and safeguard vulnerable adults from abuse by the introduction of local and national multi-agency policies and guidelines in co-operation with the Garda, HSE, voluntary bodies and training bodies to provide intervention, protection and the best possible outcomes for vulnerable adults at all times.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I understand but I am telling you, a Cheann Comhairle, why I do not agree with the Order of Business.  The most important element of today's business is the last proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The original calendar of Dáil sittings circulated by the Chief Whip proposed the Dáil should meet on 13 January.  While the calendar states it is subject to change, there is no reason that the Dáil should wait until 19 January to return.  The British Government, for instance, will meet on 5 January.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">On Leaders' Questions yesterday, Deputy Eamon Gilmore raised the recent comments by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, that an inquiry be established to look into the reasons behind the catastrophic banking failure in this country.  This is not a request from a Member but from the Governor of the Central Bank to an Oireachtas committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">It is important the reasons and the underlying causes of that failure be known, dealt with and a system put in place to ensure that it does not happen again.  I inquired from the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Bernard Allen, as to whether his committee has the resources and the capacity to conduct such an inquiry.  He informed me it does not and neither does the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Such an inquiry will require special legislation.  It is of critical importance to everyone as a consequence and, therefore, must be debated fully in the Dáil.  We would have an opportunity to do so if the Dáil were to meet on 13 January.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Anglo Irish Bank is continuing with the forbearance of the Financial Regulator under licence.  It has skewed the market with the aggressive way it is pursuing deposits.  It appears from reports that the Government may have to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank with between €4 billion and €6 billion.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_20">Are we seriously contemplating putting that kind of money into a failed bank without even a Dáil debate?  This is another reason the Dáil should have ample opportunity to discuss these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Every business in the State believes energy costs are way too high.  It is time to address the elephant in the corner of the room and discuss the break-up of the ESB.  While keeping the transmission systems in national ownership, we must open power generation to competition so that prices can drop and business can again become competitive.  If the Taoiseach wants evidence of that, he can ask any company trading abroad about Irish energy costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">These are some reasons that the Dáil should meet on 13 January 2010.  I do not agree with the proposed Order of Business and will vote against it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_23">I, too, wish to oppose the Order of Business.  There are serious matters that this House needs to discuss immediately after Christmas.  It is unacceptable that we should have to wait until 19 January to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The original schedule for the sittings of the House provided that it would be back on 13 January 2010.  I welcomed that the House was coming back earlier than was previously the case.  Deputy Kenny mentioned that we need to debate a proposal to establish an inquiry as to what happened to our banking system.  I invite the Taoiseach to say if he has such a proposal yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">We know the banks will be back in the new year with the lámh amach arís for more money.  We will also be dealing with the consequences of the budget.  The issue of those hit with social welfare cuts will impact at the beginning of January.  We need to be in a position for the House to come back quickly and deal with the fall-out of that.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Bill 2009, passed yesterday by the House, will give rise to serious anomalies in public servants' payments.  For example, the definition of "public service" used in the Bill is the same as that used for the pension levy.  There was a logic in using it for the pension levy because it was designed to provide for a situation that people who did not have access to a pension would not be hit with it.  The definition used in the Bill yesterday will give rise to all kinds of anomalies in the new year as to who will be impacted.  The Dáil needs clarification on this earlier than 19 January.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">It is somewhat ironic, a Cheann Comhairle, that the Taoiseach and the Government collapsed the pay talks with the trade unions over a proposal for additional leave and then come in here to propose an additional week's leave for themselves after Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">Essentially, the Order of Business is about the running order for today's business.  While the last item, No. 7, is to do with the return of the Dáil in the new year, we need to deal with several other issues in sequence.  We can deal with Deputy Kenny's amendment when we come to No. 7.  The first proposal——</p>

          <p eId="para_44">The Government has no respect for this Chamber, its Opposition voices or the normal debate that should be part and parcel of the democratic institution of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The Government is pressing ahead with guillotining four more Bills, following on everything it has rammed down the people's throats these past few weeks.  It is an outrageous approach.  The House will rise today when community development projects across this State are in absolute turmoil because the Government has given notice they are to cease operation from the end of this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">That is a wonderful Christmas message for the people at the coalface of dealing with the most marginalised and needy in society.  Not only has the Government cut social welfare payments and taken from public service workers, the buffer of community development projects, built up over many years, and the supports they provide, which will be needed more than ever, will be undermined.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh's request under Standing Order 32 was giving voice to the countless organisations that will be affected up and down the country.  What sort of message goes out that the Dáil will not debate the impact of these cuts.  It is not about coming back on 13 January 2010.  We should not be rising for Christmas but be back in business next week to deal with this urgent matter the Taoiseach does not want to address in the House.</p>

It would have been appropriate for Members of the House to have had the opportunity to pay tribute to the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan, and the staff at that office.  It is unfortunate that we are being asked to agree it without making any reference to the excellent work over the past six years that has been performed by both the Ombudsman for Children and her staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">It might be agreed on the other side of the House, but at least we have been consistent in objecting to Bills being guillotined through here.  If business had been better regulated by the House, these matters could have been separated and dealt with thoroughly and comprehensively, as they should be.  For that reason, I object to it again.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">The Bill allows Coillte to increase its requirement significantly.  In that light, the amount of time designated for the Bill is far too short.  We need a proper and lengthy debate on the nature and workings of Coillte.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">The Sinn Féin Deputies also object to the imposition of a guillotine on the passage of the Forestry (Amendment) Bill 2009, as we will in each of the others where the Government is seeking to have the debate on the measures contained in them curtailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I also wish to reflect that it is objectionable to my party that the ordering of each of these Bills, including the Forestry (Amendment) Bill 2009, is purely to facilitate both the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, and my party, Sinn Féin, is excluded from the ordering in terms of opening positions.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">However, guillotines have now become a management tool applied by the Government to the work of this Chamber.  The purpose of the Chamber is to examine legislation and to hold the Government to account.  Large sections of the legislation, especially important legislation, that goes through the Chamber is not debated at all because it is guillotined by the Government.  It is not only guillotined on one Stage but on every Stage, even Committee Stage.  Many amendments tabled by the Government, never mind Opposition amendments, are never examined or reached.  The legislation is simply passed on the nod.  The Parliament is becoming a rubber stamp for Government executive decisions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_649">I disagree with this proposal and propose that the Dáil resume on 13 January 2010 as was the original intention in the list of sessions circulated by the Government Whip.  I repeat that it provides an opportunity for serious discussion here about serious issues.  We are expected to have a situation where, possibly in the first quarter of next year, the Government, through the taxpayer's pocket, will fork out another €4 billion, €5 billion or €6 billion to Anglo Irish Bank, which is continuing to trade under licence with the forbearance of the regulator.  We must take very seriously the statement made by the Governor of the Central Bank that there should be an inquiry into the underlying causes of the catastrophic failure of the banking system in Ireland.  As the Taoiseach is well aware, that will require special legislation to be introduced and passed by the Oireachtas.  It will also mean that the committee chosen to do that will have to have extended powers and the implications of the Abbeylara decision some years ago in respect of committees and their powers will need to be thoroughly discussed before that matter can be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I would like the Dáil to have the opportunity to discuss the implications of the publication of the lost at sea report before referral to a committee for detailed analysis, and there is a range of other reports and issues that need to be addressed by the Oireachtas.  There is no reason the Dáil should not resume on 13 January and I respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach that he should decide now to come back on 13 January as originally intended to resume the debate on serious matters on behalf of the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">Whatever about previous years there is no justification for the House adjourning until 19 January this year.  These are not normal times and this should not be treated as business as usual.  Unemployment figures released yesterday show that approximately 185,000 more people were unemployed last year than in the previous year — 142,000 men and 42,000 women.  We had figures yesterday showing that emigration is back to the levels of decades ago, with 60,000 emigrating last year.  We have had information this morning that the country's GNP was down 11.3% this year.  We are in an economic crisis and we should not be adjourning until 19 January.  At the very least the House should be back on the date originally agreed, which was 13 January.</p>

          <p eId="para_656">Whatever about the resumption date proposed in January it is important to note that many Members here on all sides of the House will be back working on committee business on 13 January in any event.  I am aware Deputy O'Rourke, who has taken the initiative with the children's referendum committee, will be working here the week prior to the proposition and I see no reason why everybody cannot be back.  I have empathy with that proposal but to go back to the point I made earlier, we have not had an opportunity to address the devastating effect of the Government's decision on community development projects throughout the country.</p>

As constituency Deputies on all sides from my own constituency of Cavan and Monaghan must be aware, this is having a hugely negative impact on people who have invested substantial parts of their adult life in developing community support mechanisms.

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_958">Will the Government have to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank by some €6 billion in the spring?  Has the Government considered the comment made by the Governor of the Central Bank that there should be an inquiry into the reasons for the failure of the banking system?  Has it considered the fact that legislation will have to be introduced to give effect to such an inquiry?  In that context, has it given consideration to the consequences of the Supreme Court decision on the Abbeylara case a number of years ago?</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I wish to raise a matter relevant to a decision taken in the budget, namely, the reduction in excise duties.  It was welcomed by the sector but the measure does not seem to have been thought through in the context of wholesalers who have purchased substantial amounts of spirits and so on and will now find themselves in a desperate situation whereby they are expected to take the hit as a consequence of the reduction in excise duty.  I remind the Taoiseach that when a similar situation arose in the 1980s, when there were none of the digital communications systems we have now, off-licences and wholesalers brought their stock to bonded warehouse where it was re-issued at the lower rate.  I know there is a meeting today with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">I have first hand evidence that there will be a substantial number of job losses if some mechanism to give a rebate on the duty paid cannot be given to the wholesalers concerned.  Some people have been caught for €50,000, €300,000 and, in one case, up to €1 million.   There is evidence the Revenue Commissioners have written to at least one of the people concerned stating a mechanism would be put in place for a rebate of the duty involved.  It is a matter which the Government should immediately address because the money is due to be paid very shortly and many people will not be able to continue in business if they have to take a hit of that order.  The decision to reduce excise duty may not have been fully thought through.  It is an issue which deserves the Taoiseach's attention before he leaves for Copenhagen.</p>

          <p eId="para_961">The recapitalisation policy was outlined by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, on a number of occasions.  Until such time as he comes to the Government again for consideration of these matters, it will be not be dealt with until then.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">On the matter raised by the Governor of the Central Bank at a committee meeting a number of days ago, I have made the point that what he said will have to be carefully considered.  The immediate priority of Government is to ensure we establish financial stability and effective restructuring of the banking system during the course of the financial crisis, all of which will have to be considered carefully in that context.  I mentioned the fact that the priority of the resources of the State in terms of the personnel who work in these areas is to establish such stability and provide for restructuring.  I would not like to see that priority diverted at any time in the immediate period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">On the issue of excise duty, it is something which would have to be taken up with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, and the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not in a position to make any comment on it.  I note the Deputy's remarks.</p>

          <p eId="para_964">On the proposal from the Governor of the Central Bank that there should be an inquiry into what happened in our banking system, it is not a complex issue which requires a great deal of consideration.  The Taoiseach will agree or disagree with the proposal.  All of the indications are that he is trying to find every and any excuse not to agree to it.  It is something which the Labour Party intends to press when we return in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">I agree with Deputy Kenny on the manner in which the excise duty increase is affecting people, some of whom bought in Christmas stock.  To some extent, the issue is related to the time of year because of the timing of the budget.  Perhaps the measure was not thought through.  Some people assembled Christmas stock before the budget and are now required to pass on the reduction in excise duty to their customers and are caught for the full amount.  The issue needs to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">Another issue I want to raise is the proposal that there be an election next summer for a mayor of Dublin.  We are at the end of the year.  There is a proposal that there be an election next June for a directly elected mayor of Dublin.  We do not yet know what this job will involve; what the office will entail; what the costs associated with it will be; how it will relate to the existing local government structure; and whether the mayor will be elected in addition to the mayor of the city of Dublin, which is elected by Dublin City Council, and to the cathaoirligh elected by the three Dublin county councils.

Is the Taoiseach serious about proceeding with an election next June for something which has not yet been legislated for or discussed here?  Whether it has been discussed by the Government is another day's work.  As this is the last sitting day before the turn of the year, the very least we need to know is if the election is going ahead, what the mayor will do and what the powers and functions of the office will be.  If there is an election next June, from a political point of view, people need to decide if they want to be candidates and political parties need to decide who they might nominate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1094">Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce legislation in the new year to amend the redress board legislation to extend it to those who suffered barbaric cruelty in the Magdalene laundries?  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform now has irrefutable evidence that this State and the courts colluded in sending young women to what were then known as the Magdalene asylums.  They ended up in the Magdalene laundries and were treated appallingly.  Some of them have never recovered from the manner in which they were treated and their lives have been permanently blighted.  Initially in this House the Minister for Education and Science denied that the State had any involvement in this.  There is now absolutely irrefutable evidence as a consequence of court records and files that have been examined in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the State was directly complicit in many women being placed in these totally inappropriate circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_1095">I support the views expressed by Deputy Shatter that the Government should look again at the need for a distinct redress scheme for the Magdalene laundries.  The Minister outlined his position when he stated: "The State did not refer individuals to Magdalene laundries nor was it complicit in referring individuals to them."  Professor James Smith from Boston came here on Tuesday and I facilitated a meeting with him of an all-party group of Oireachtas Members.  He has presented very strong evidence that the young women were routinely referred to various Magdalene asylums via the Irish court system.  The Garda actually returned women who escaped from these laundry institutions even though these women should have been perfectly free to leave.  Professor Smith met officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and got a very positive response.  On the basis of this new evidence I ask the Taoiseach to look again at the need to address the case of the Magdalene laundries.  The Government is following up on the recommendations of the Ryan report, but these people are being excluded.  It is a matter of justice and principle.  While I accept there are financial implications, not many women are involved and many of them have been looked after.  We claim to cherish all of our children equally and the case is very strong for those who were in the Magdalene laundries.  It is new evidence and the Government would be right to look at it again.</p>

I have asked that the issue be discussed in the Adjournment debate and I hope it will be granted.  The fact that officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform met Professor Smith represents a very welcome sea change from the previous approach.

They have been there for between 30 and 50 years.  These are extremely elderly women and we have done nothing as a nation to deal with them.  It is about time that we did.  It is an important issue to debate in this House.  On this last day of the session before Christmas, it would be great to get a commitment from the Taoiseach that something substantial would be done by way of legislation to deal with this matter.</p>

I should like to join with the Taoiseach at this time of seasonal goodwill to extend, on behalf of my party, my thanks to the all the staff of this House for the work they do, bolstering our democratic system, the ushers, the editorial staff and the gardaí.  I want to mention, in particular, the Clerk of the Dáil and his staff for their objective assistance to the Ceann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">Deputy Kirk is a new person in that office.  Many might have assumed we would be addressing a different figurehead, who since departed the Chair, for other reasons.  I should like to pay tribute to members of the Fourth Estate, who have a job to do.  Sometimes, those who read what they write might not like what they have written, but be that as it may I have the utmost respect for the democratic requirement as regards the publication of their views about what we say here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">It should also be noted that a number of people have retired from the service of the House in the past period.  I am thinking of Padraig Ó hAilín, Eoin Faherty, Garda Tony Brophy and others who were here for many years.  As it is close to Christmas, I remember being on a delegation, not a junket, to Israel many years ago in the village of Nazareth.  I said to Mr. Ó hAilín, who was the commander of that delegation, that I should like to go to Cana to see where the wedding took place.  He put a prohibition order on me immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">To the Members of the House, my party, Fine Gael and the Labour Party as well as to the Independents who support us I want to wish the very best.  Finally, I extend seasonal greetings to the Taoiseach and members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Green Party, as well as the Independents who support them.  We have had considerable jousting in this Chamber and outside over the past 12 months.  We will have more, but for now the Taoiseach may go to Copenhagen with my blessing.  Tell the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that work is proceeding on the incinerator at Ringsend in his absence.  He should come home with the climate change agreement in his back pocket and be the man who has lifted Ireland onto the international stage, taking on those other people who are arriving tonight and assuring them that we are going to lead from the front.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">Seriously, the Taoiseach should take a few days off.  He needs to do that.  If he is looking for me he shall find me deep in the recesses of the Néifinn Bheag range, clearing out my mind for the next period ahead when I look forward to good political debate and robust activity in this Chamber in the interests of our people.  I conclude by wishing everybody the very best at this time of difficulty.  Bearing that in mind, we should made the best of the Christmas.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle.</p>

I should like to join other Deputies in extending seasonal greetings to the Ceann Comhairle, Members of the House from all parties and none and their families, who are oftentimes not seen or associated with the difficulties elected representatives have to contend with so much.  Therefore I should particularly like to pay tribute to the families at this time of Christmas.  I should like also to extend seasonal greetings and every blessing for the new year to the Clerk of the Dáil and the staff here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, to the ushers and all the support staff who make Leinster House work on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">I should also like to include all the members of the press, without exception, even though they have not always included me and my colleagues in the course of the year and hope that in 2010 we might occasionally enjoy a little more attention.  I am conscious as we all are, that while I extend seasonal greetings at this time, there is very little real joy out there in society.  There is very little sense of a pre-Christmas atmosphere, so much of it has been lost because of the difficult economic times in which we live.  I do not mean this politically, but this has been compounded by decisions and measures taken by Government and passed through these Houses over recent weeks.  These are sad times and we in Sinn Féin have endeavoured to play our part in helping to point to alternative ways to address the difficulties we all face.  We have a shared responsibility to try to overcome those difficulties.  My hope is that when next we rise, if indeed we are to rise in these respective positions in 12 months time, they will be happier and more prosperous times for all our people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1277">I will do my best to speak as quickly as possible, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as many Members wish to speak.  They will not be able to do so, however, because of the votes and other issues.  For the Deputy's information, I do not have an amendment on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">The Bill before us amends section 24(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Forestry Act 1988 in which the existing borrowing limit of IR£80 million is stipulated.  The existing statutory limit was set in 1988, when the legislation providing for the establishment of Coillte was enacted, and has not been increased since then.  Coillte has a significant capital investment programme each year, which includes reforestation, investment in forest infrastructure, and plant and equipment.  It is necessary to increase the statutory borrowing limit to make adequate provision for the borrowing requirements of Coillte for its capital expenditure programme.  Section 2 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction of the Bill and is a standard provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">Coillte Teoranta is the national forestry company, established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act 1988.  The Act provides that the principal objects of the company are as set out in that Act.  I will skip over those in order to allow time for others to speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">Coillte currently manages 445,000 hectares of forest land of which 79% is forested with the remaining 21% encompassing open spaces, water, roads or land above the tree line.  Such management includes maintenance of the forest estate, felling as appropriate and replanting.  The company supplies logs to the timber processing industry, including sawmills, panel board mills and the emerging energy supply businesses.  While the company provides direct employment, it also engages harvesting and haulage contractors thereby sustaining employment for a far greater number.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">The company also owns two panel board businesses: Smartply in Kilkenny, which is close to Waterford port; and Medite in Tipperary, both of which I visited recently.  These manufacture OSB and MDF boards respectively with over 80% of their output being exported.  There are significant investments currently in train in both plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">Coillte has entered into a joint venture arrangement with the ESB to develop a wind farm in Garvagh Glebe, Co. Leitrim.  It is also important not to overlook Coillte's contribution to recreation by way of its Forest Parks and trails and its involvement in Lough Key Forest Park in County Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">The company now has an extensive remit.  Colleagues in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food met with representatives from Coillte at the end of October to discuss the company's annual report for 2008, at which Coillte informed the members of its current structure and its businesses.  I will not go into those elements at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">The purpose of this brief outline of Coillte's business interests is to put in context the proposed increase in the statutory borrowings level for the company — or, in reality, the group — as the limit on borrowings applies to the aggregate at any one time of borrowings by the company and its subsidiaries.  The limit on the company's level of statutory borrowings is currently €101.5 million.  The business environment in which Coillte, as a commercial company, operates is vastly different from the business environment in which it operated in its earlier years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">There is a provision in the Act whereby Coillte may seek approval for temporary borrowings.  Coillte has sought and received approval under this provision on a number of occasions over the last number of years.  However, it is considered sensible to increase the statutory borrowing limit formally, rather than have any concern about the interpretation of the term "temporary" in the context of borrowings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">While it was generally accepted in principle that the company's statutory borrowing limit should be increased, there has been much consideration as to the most appropriate level.  Inflation alone would allow an increase in the borrowing limit from €101.5 million to €182.5 million.  This is based on inflating the €101.5 million limit in 1988 by Ireland's inflation rate up to October 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">Coillte has significant capital expenditure each year.  In its annual report and accounts for 2008, Coillte states that its capital expenditure in 2008 was €58.1 million.  It also explained that "a significant proportion of the expenditure was incurred in enhancing and maintaining the forest estate and expanding the road network within the forest".  It added that the "expenditure also included a substantial investment in Medite Europe Limited that will increase production capacity and improve operational efficiency".  The figure for capital expenditure in previous years was €58.4 million in 2007 and €49.4 million in 2006.  This level of ongoing capital expenditure was a consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">Coillte has outlined its strategic plans to 2012 in its document, Destination 2012, to which it referred in its discussion with the joint committee.  This document focuses on Coillte's four business areas and contains numerous proposals, including proposed investment in renewable energy, especially wind energy.  The strategic plan requires in-depth consideration to which I will refer again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">With regard to determining the most appropriate level to which the limit should be increased, it was concluded that €400 million would allow Coillte sufficient headroom for core activities, working capital as well as approved investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">With regard to the consideration of Coillte's strategic plan, the House is aware that under the new programme for Government, I am committed to reviewing State forestry policy to take account of its critical role with regard to climate change and its importance to construction, bio-energy, bio-diversity and its potential to deliver long-term employment in other downstream industries.  The review will include the role of Coillte and its functions and operations.  It will also assess the effectiveness of current forestry grant schemes and make recommendations on how best to deliver supports in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Three working groups are being established to carry out the review, with each group assigned a specific aspect.  The respective groups will review forestry grant and premium schemes; State forestry policy; and the role, functions and operations of Coillte.  With regard to the review of the role, functions and operations of Coillte, the working group will also consider the Coillte strategy document, Destination 2012 to which I referred earlier.  Pending the outcome of these reviews, my initial view is that Coillte, with its extensive experience in forestry management and knowledge of the timber market, has played a significant role in the development of Irish forestry and that it is timely to look at its role, functions and operations to optimise its contribution to forestry and the economy.  I look forward to the output from the Coillte review group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">With regard to the proposal before us, to increase Coillte's statutory borrowing limit, it is important, in view of its current contribution to the economy by way of employment, both direct and indirect, and the export of its products, that Coillte be provided with the means to acquire adequate funding for investment in its businesses.  There are also the numerous other benefits which we derive from Coillte's management of the forestry estate, such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity benefits and the provision of recreational facilities.  I stress that an increase in the company's statutory borrowing limit does not automatically mean that the company may borrow to that limit.  Under Section 24(1) of the Forestry Act 1988, the borrowings of the company require the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  When the company sends a request outlining its expected borrowing requirements, the request is closely examined by the Department and the Department of Finance and, if considered reasonable and soundly based, it will be submitted to the Ministers for consent.  The level of borrowings is also reported to the Departments on a monthly basis.  This requirement is in addition to the reporting requirements provided in the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">Significant investment proposals also require the approval of both Ministers.  With regard to reporting requirements, I draw particular attention to the requirement in the code of practice which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1294">The chairperson of each State body must furnish to the relevant Minister in conjunction with the annual report and accounts of the body, a comprehensive report covering the group. . . outlining all commercially significant developments affecting the body in the preceding year, including the establishment of subsidiaries or joint ventures and share acquisitions, and major issues likely to arise in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">I take this opportunity to welcome the revised and updated code of practice for the governance of State bodies published by the Minister of Finance earlier this year.  The reporting requirements, which it stipulates, and ongoing communication between Departments and agencies under their remit are vital elements in the oversight of agencies.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1298">Investment in forestry has been a part of Government policy since the foundation of the State.  This investment has contributed to a thriving wood processing sector which employs many thousands throughout Ireland, in both rural and urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">The next part of my speech deals with COFORD and general issues of importance.  However, in view of the fact I want to allow colleagues to have an opportunity to speak and that the delay was beyond my control, I will skip the next part.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">On the role of Coillte in afforestation, when it was first established in 1989 the company actively engaged in land acquisition for afforestation purposes and expansion of its estate.  In latter years, it has reduced its land acquisition programme for a number of reasons, including reduced availability of land for sale, rising land prices and the company's ineligibility for forestry premiums.  Since 2000, the company has focused on contributing to the afforestation programme through its farm partnership schemes, by providing forestry services to farmers and by promoting forestry investment.  Coillte is currently engaged with Bord na Móna in a joint venture to afforest cutaway bogs.  The pilot phase of this project will commence next year with the planting of 200 hectares initially.  It is proposed to plant up to 5,000 hectares over a number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">In the wider context, Coillte also has a pivotal role to play in renewable energy.  Coillte is strategically positioning its forestry business and biomass resource to play an important part in contributing to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and climate change mitigation in Ireland.  While much of Coillte's timber supply is destined for processing, the production of biomass for energy will still be significant for the company.  The company is working with the key stakeholders, including the relevant Department, and has established a pilot depot in County Mayo.  Coillte is also currently seeking to align itself with a leading technology company with demonstrable experience and a proven track record in the larger industrial biomass sector.  Wind energy is also regarded as playing a major role in the achievement of the renewable energy targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">I am sure members appreciate Coillte has developed significantly from the time of its establishment.  I believe that for commercial and operational reasons, it is timely to revisit the level of statutory borrowings set down.  As I said, the most appropriate level received a lot of consideration and €400 million was the amount considered appropriate at this time.  I remind the House that agreeing to this increase does not mean that Coillte may automatically borrow to that level.  The consent of both Ministers is required for the level of borrowings and requests will be the subject of scrutiny by both Departments.  It is not envisaged that this proposed level will be sought in the immediate future.  However, when it is being amended, it is important to provide for a sufficiently high level in the medium term.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1303">The manner in which this debate is being conducted in the House is an insult to the Minister and all sides of the debate.  It makes a mockery of the requirement for due process.  I would like to refer to the point of order made by Deputy P. J. Sheehan which questioned whether the Minister intended to move an amendment on Committee Stage to section 25(2) of the Forestry Act 1988.  Deputy P. J. Sheehan has made a serious intervention because it questions the adequacy of the legislation as drafted.  It highlights the dangers of rushing legislation through the House.  It may be inadequate but I hope the Minister can assure us in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">I appreciate there is very little time and I want to ensure Deputy Sherlock is allowed some.  Therefore, I will just make a few short points.  Coillte was before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recently.  It was an insult to the members, of all parties, that Coillte did not raise the matter of borrowing with us.  It is a State-sponsored semi-State company, not a Government-sponsored semi-State company, with a commercial remit and it would have been appropriate for it to have raised these issues with us at the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">Why is Coillte seeking €400 million?  Did it seek a greater amount?  What is the emergency forcing us to rush this legislation?  Could the Bill not have been published earlier, thus having allowed us to do adequate research?  Is it urgent?  At the committee meeting, reference was made to the black hole in Coillte's pension fund.  Does it want to borrow to deal with that?</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Are all the borrowings undertaken by Coillte to date compliant with the existing legislation?  Are all the other agencies within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food complying with their statutory borrowing limits?  This raises some very interesting questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">Let me refer to forestry in general.  Since 1995, when 23,700 hectares were planted, there has been a dramatic decline in the rate of planting, to approximately 6,500 hectares in 2009.  The target in the programme for Government is 10,000 hectares per annum.  Coillte is a player in this regard.  We are led to believe the target of 10,000 hectares could be achieved through an additional budgetary provision of €2 million.  The ink is not dry on the renewed programme for Government, yet the figures contained in a reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Crawford on the matter show how big the gap is.  Forestry has a significant role to play in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but we are way behind the United Kingdom and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_1308">It is impossible to have a meaningful debate on this subject. I strongly object to the manner in which the debate is being conducted.</p>

Why do we find ourselves in circumstances where I have merely two or three minutes to discuss a princely sum that could potentially amount to €400 million?</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">I do not have adequate time to discuss the fact that the CEO of Coillte is being paid over €400,000 at a time when the subsidiaries under Coillte are completely under-performing, nor do I have time to analyse properly the Minister of State's speech, in which he states €1.89 billion, or just under 1% of GDP, is attributed to forestry.  That figure is from 2008 but it will be reduced significantly in the future given that the subsidiaries are under-performing.  I wanted time to discuss this in greater detail.</p>

I wanted to discuss the fact that Coillte is currently being audited by the Forest Stewardship Council.  Will the Minister expound on that process?</p>

          <p eId="para_1320">Forestry provides an alternative source of income for farmers who have land unsuited to stock or tillage.  It can have an input into the production of alternative energy using biomass, woodchip and thinnings.  However, despite some effort to encourage the planting of trees, the level of afforestation remains very low.  In 2007, approximately 724,000 hectares, or 10% of the land area, was under forest.  This compares with the EU 27 average of 42%, which is alarming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The benefit of forestry, particularly to marginal land in the west and south west, cannot be stressed enough.  In my county, Kerry, there are 33,000 hectares under forest, comprising 1,300 small forestry farms.  The small size of the farms and the lack of necessary supports contribute to economic disadvantage in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">Last year, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food produced a report on farming in the west.  One proposal made to the committee was that small farmers should pool their resources to maximise potential.  This is the way to make progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">The extent of afforestation in more marginal land demonstrates its importance.  County Leitrim has the second highest afforestation density while County Wicklow has the highest.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1333">(<i>a</i>) by the insertion of the words “but shall not exceed €100,000,000, without receiving the express approval of Dáil Éireann” after “the consent of the Minister for Finance”, and</p>

          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_1335">"(<i>a</i>) Monies borrowed temporarily at any point in the accounting year under this subsection shall be noted in the annual report of the company for that accounting year.”.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">Section 24 of the Forestry Act 1988 deals with Coillte's borrowing entitlements.  Section 24(2) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1337">The company may borrow money (including money in a currency other than the currency of the State) temporarily but the aggregate at any one time of such borrowings shall not exceed such amount as has been approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">My amendment provides that any borrowings of Coillte's could not exceed 25% of its total borrowings capacity of €400 million without having the express approval of Dáil Éireann.  If Coillte wanted to borrow in excess of €100 million, it could only do so with the express approval of the House through the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">We are being asked to approve on the hoof a capacity for a semi-State company to borrow up to €400 million, four times its current permitted amount, without any satisfactory debate.  It is important, therefore, to put in some system of checks and balances.  It is imminently sensible, particularly as the appropriate level of scrutiny being afforded to us today is all the more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">Why did Coillte attend an Oireachtas committee several weeks ago to discuss its annual report but never made a single reference to the fact it felt hamstrung by the current legislative arrangements for borrowing and was in negotiations with Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Finance on the matter?  It is an insult to the Oireachtas.  As I said earlier on Second Stage, Coillte is not a Government or Fianna Fáil-Green Party sponsored body, it is a State-sponsored body.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is the appropriate venue for Coillte to articulate its concerns.  Without a rational explanation forthcoming, I am disappointed the committee was snubbed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">The Minister baulked at giving a response to my question on if Coillte was originally looking for more than €400 million.  Is Coillte borrowing the moneys for capital purposes, day-to-day expenditure or to fill the black hole in its pensions fund?  These are issues which the truncated Second Stage debate did not allow us to address properly and I hope the Minister of State will be able to do so now.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_1342">The Bill seeks the permission of the House to afford to Coillte the opportunity to increase its statutory borrowing requirement from €101.5 million to €400 million.  In his Second Stage speech, the Minister of State pointed out that inflation alone would allow an increase in the borrowing limit to €182.5 million.  This is based on inflating the €101.5 million limit in 1988 by Ireland's inflation rate up to October 2009.  Will the Minister of State give us a more detailed analysis of that assertion?  Coillte's borrowings to the end of 1988 are €161.2 million and it has approval to borrow up to €260 million under sections 24(1) and (2) of the Forestry Act 1988.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">The Minister of State gave a good overview of Coillte's workings, the direction it wants to take in corporate planning and the working groups established to review its operations.  There was no mention, however, of the pensions deficit, a fundamental aspect of the company's operations, or the chief executive officer's and the board's remunerations.  There are also questions surrounding a Forestry Stewardship Council report which indicted some aspects of Coillte's operations.  The Labour Party would be reluctant to support any mechanism to allow for an increase in a company's borrowing requirements unless there is some degree of transparency in its operations.  The Minister of State's Second Stage speech did not sufficiently address these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">The company's reports and accounts also do not address these issues.  When Coillte attended the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in October, one got the impression everything was rosy in the garden.  There were, however, some difficulties for ancillary firms such as Mediate and others with the downturn in the construction industry and this was reflected in their results.  What is the future for these firms?  I do not see enough reporting back to this House on how these operations will proceed and their individual financial positions.  Is the new borrowing requirement to facilitate any of these offshoot companies?  What will the nature of their financial position be as a result of this amending legislation?  Before the House is requested to up Coillte's borrowing requirement, it requires more information as to how it does business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">People tend to look favourably on Coillte's operations because of the recreational and amenity value of its work.  I have benefited from them myself in the Ballyhouras and there is a certain pride in how Coillte has developed amenities well.  With the Copenhagen summit agenda, there is the political consideration of the role of forestry in reducing or offsetting CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  Will the increase in permissible borrowing go towards facilitating this process?  If so, will Coillte have a significant role in that process?</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">I would also like the Minister of State to address the issue of the role of the Forestry Stewardship Council.  It is hoped, given the 2006 report and the audit under way, that there would be significant improvement in corporate social responsibility and the role of corporate governance in respect of how Coillte performs its functions.  Fundamentally, we need a little more transparency in regard to the operations of Coillte.  While we all believe that it is a force to do good, there are aspects of its operation which, from time to time, leave doubts in one's mind.  Were the agency to be a little more transparent there would be a great deal more goodwill towards measures such as this.</p>

          <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
          <p eId="para_1347">I am disappointed that the Government has chosen to deal with the Forestry (Amendment) Bill 2009 with indecent haste.  It is always said that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  There are many Members of this House who would like to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  However, this will not be possible given a guillotine has been applied to it.  This emergency legislation was drafted last week and is set to pass all Stages within a few hours.  This is not proper governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">When was the need for this legislation notified to the Minister of State's Department and by whom?  What is the need for this emergency legislation if Coillte has been compliant to date?  Could the Minister of State not have waited for the proposed forestry Bill, promised for the past four or five years?  Where is the fire?  The Minister of State has told the House the purpose of the Bill is to reform and update the legislative framework relating to forestry to support the development of a modern forestry sector that enshrines the principles of sustainable forestry management and protection of the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">The Bill will also allow for change of land use from forestry to other sustainable uses and to provide a statutory basis for forest service guidelines and forest management plans.  What is the point of the Bill if we do not have a legislative framework to support the development of a modern forestry sector?  Where is the long promised forestry Bill?  Does the tabling of this Bill also mean that it is unlikely the forestry Bill will be introduced during the lifetime of this Dáil?  Can the Minister of State guarantee this House that all borrowings by Coillte during the past 10 years complied with existing legislation?  I am suspicious about the timing and rushed nature of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">Coillte recently presented its 2008 annual report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and stated that it has been, since the middle of this year, in the process of restructuring its finances.  My suspicion is that one of our hallowed financial institutions discovered, during the negotiations for this restructuring, a flaw in the statutory conditions under which Coillte operated.  Hundreds of thousands of euro have been paid to auditors and legal advisers during the past 20 years.  Did they ever raise this question and if not, why not?  They have been paid professional fees to certify that the company's accounts are in compliance with the law and that taxpayers' money has been fully accounted for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">With regard to the deficit in the pension funds, has Coillte concluded negotiations about the deficit in the pension scheme?  Are any of these increased borrowings being used to fund the deficit?  I would like the Minister of State, in his reply, to state how the figure of €400 million was arrived at.  Was this figure proposed by Coillte or decided by the Department?</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">Fine Gael has tabled the amendment that temporary borrowings should be limited to 25% of the statutory borrowing limit set out in the Bill.  The fact that temporary borrowings amount to almost 70% of the statutory limit shows how this legislation was flouted.  Fine Gael has also tabled an amendment that all temporary borrowings should be recorded in the annual report for that year to provide proper governance of Coillte and to ensure such irregular situations can never arise again and that all these agencies are within their statutory borrowing limits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">I note from the 2008 annual report that there has been no reduction in the directors' fees and emoluments.  Will the Minister of State provide a guarantee to the House that a reduction will be reported in the 2009 report?  I am concerned that employment levels in Coillte have remained fairly static in the past ten years.  It employs approximately 1,200 people.  Much contract work has been abandoned to the private sector and Coillte has taken a role in processing and manufacturing from the private sector.  I want to see these increased borrowings targeted at creating sustainable employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">Regarding the role of Coillte, I am reminded of what Mr. Nigel Henderson said: "The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit."  I am concerned there is much about this Bill that is shady.  If we do not have a proper debate on this Bill then these suspicions will remain.   I would like to quote Professor Sara Ebenreck, an American writer on land use policy and values.  She said: "Trees outstrip most people in the extent and depth of their work for the public good".  I am not sure that the public good is being served by the enacting of this legislation here today in an hour and a half.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_1356">An increase in the moneys available to Coillte is to be welcomed if this means Coillte will take a more proactive role in promoting forestry and the development of forestry based projects.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">As was pointed out in last year's report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, there is considerable potential for the expansion of this sector in terms of alternative farm enterprises as part of the overall development of forestry based enterprises, which would benefit the rural economy and create jobs.  There are ambitious targets for the expansion of this sector in the western counties.  Under its wood energy strategy and action plan, the Western Development Commission forecasts a 300% growth in the wood energy sector during the next ten years, adding approximately €15 million annually to the region's income and create up to 900 full time jobs as well as saving 620,000 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.  When fully operative, it would be in demand from local farmers for 472,000 hectares of thinning which would be worth approximately €1.7 million annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">Forestry provides an alternative source of income for farmers from land unsuited for stock or tillage.  It can also be a source of input in the production of alternative energy, through biomass or directly through wood chips and thinnings.  However, despite some efforts to encourage the growth of trees, the level of afforestation remains low.  In 2002, approximately 724,000 hectares, 10% of the total land area, was under forest.  This compares to an average of 42% in the EU 27.  The one positive aspect was that 92% of forests was available for input into wood supply compared to the EU 27 average of 73%.  A high proportion of Irish forestry is also in private ownership.  Some 2,500 were directly employed in forestry in 2007, with a further 7,100 employed in wood processing.  Net timber imports were valued at €375 million in 2007, representing a potential area of import substitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">A more critical view of forestry would contend that the lack of planning in the siting of plantations has increased the isolation of some farms.  There is also the perception that planting trees is a sign that one has accepted that farming, as it was traditionally conducted on the land, is no longer viable.</p>

          <p eId="para_1363">It has also been suggested that land capable of being used for food production not be allowed for the use of growing trees.  That is a point that should be taken on board.  There is good arable land being used for trees when there is ample marginal land that should be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">Another matter related to Coillte I want once again to raise is that of Ballinaboy wood, which Coillte and its companies sold to the Corrib gas project.  The wood, which was under the control of Coillte at the time, was sold to facilitate the terminal.  Despite parliamentary questions and questions under the Freedom of Information Act, I and other Deputies cannot ascertain what was paid for that land.

          <p eId="para_1368">Deputy Creed raised the question of committee procedure and I will deal with that a little later.  I will come to the amendment first.  It is an important point and I will try to address it.  The Deputy also asked about the level of afforestation, with which I will deal subsequently because it arises from what Deputy Ferris said.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">Regarding Deputy Creed's key question, which was a question from almost everybody, the total sought by Coillte reflected the plans the company had in its draft strategic report for the next number of years.  When it came into the Department, officials looked at it, and I looked at it in very considerable detail.  For example, there were elements of the draft strategic plan that would have involved Coillte in, at one level, a welcome development in the wind energy sector.  I looked at it in the context of concerns I had about the role of other Departments and other agencies.  I was trying to ensure that Coillte's plans were properly in line with what everybody else was doing and also to ensure, frankly, that no particular risks were associated with Coillte's departure into the area of alternative energy.  Such a departure by Coillte is hugely positive from a national point of view and, potentially, positive for the company in terms of its capacity to earn money in the future.  At the same time, and returning to the point made by all of the Deputies who spoke, particularly Deputies Sheehan and Ferris, afforestation is a key element of Coillte's responsibility, although a person looking at the terms of reference for the setting up of the company in 1988 might well reach a slightly different conclusion.  In any event, I was anxious that afforestation be seen as one of the key responsibilities of Coillte and I spoke strongly to the company in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">There was quite a level of interaction between the company and the Department on the strategic plan.  Ultimately, having considered all of the points made by the company and all our concerns, I concluded that €400 million was a reasonable level at this time to give the company the leeway to pursue various options and also to give us the kind of oversight that everybody in the House would wish.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1372">To the best of my recollection, for a period of 40 years or some very long period, the company projected a necessity of €600 million or €700 million — some quite large amount — which would have reflected all of the projects which may be viable on Coillte property coming to fruition, almost exclusively financed by Coillte and into operation in a short time period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">When I examined the reality of the projects concerned, it was clear that a much longer timeframe is involved for the development of a considerable number of the projects.  It was also clear that strategic partnerships with companies in the business, including another semi-State company, the ESB, removes some of the need for some of that borrowing by Coillte or its subsidiaries.  In some instances, it was at least worth examining the option of realising the value of the site rather than investing directly in it.  For a variety of reasons associated with that type of consideration, my view is that €400 million is sufficient in the immediate term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">Regarding section 24(2) of the Forestry Act 1988 and the amendment proposed by the Deputy, the position is that Coillte may borrow money temporarily with the approval of the two Ministers, as I stated.  The proposal in the amendment is to limit the amount for which Coillte may seek approval under this provision and also require the express approval of Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">If we were to amend section 24(1), it would, in fact, allow Coillte to seek approval to borrow up to €400 million.  The amount of the increase received much consideration and it was concluded, as I explained, that €400 million would be an adequate level in the medium term.  There was a certain amount of head room for contingencies and it is not envisaged that this proposed level would be sought in the immediate future.  It is also envisaged that Coillte would not need recourse to temporary borrowings as the overall limit will have been increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">Temporary borrowings under section 24(2) must be approved by the Minister, as I stated, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  If the purpose of the amendment is to impose controls on temporary borrowings, it should be noted that such approval would only be given on the basis of a sound business case submitted by Coillte, which would receive in-depth consideration in both Departments.  The level of borrowing is monitored on an ongoing basis and it is notified to the two Departments on a monthly basis, which is probably more frequently than Deputies might realise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">In view of these controls, to require the express approval of the Dáil could be regarded as unnecessary as it was considered that commercial State bodies would manage the enterprise or business assigned to them with appropriate levels of control and oversight provided in governing legislation.  This is strengthened, in my view, by the obligations in the code of practice, as amended earlier this year.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1380">I will be coming to that specific point in response to one of the points raised by Deputy Sherlock.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">On the second aspect of the amendment, the moneys borrowed temporarily shall be noted in the annual report of the company for that accounting year.  The annual report and accounts of the company already show the net debt at the beginning and end of each year on one of the notes in the financial statements, and as the statutory borrowing limit is as provided in the Act, it is clear for anyone calculating what are the amounts of temporary or long-term borrowings.  That is already <i>de facto</i> in each of the annual reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">On the additional points, Deputy Sherlock mentioned the inflation level, which, frankly, I thought should be bigger than that but which, on checking, appears to be correct.  The current borrowing level, including the €100 million, is €188.9 million.  This includes temporary and long-term borrowing.  The Deputy is right that under the original legislation it might be possible to provide up to €260 million, but we have considerable concerns in that regard.  In view of the fact that we were competing for resources at the level of the Parliamentary Counsel and the drafting offices, I decided to come forward with this and I will explain why.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">Deputy Sherlock mentioned that in my speech — I only managed to deliver approximately half of it so he might not have seen all of the original text — that there was no reference to the pensions deficit.  My reason for this is that it is not an immediate issue for 2010.  It is more a medium-term issue to be addressed in the context of the strategic plan, and perhaps also in the context of the other legislation I mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">I would also have liked to have gone into some detail, for example, on the voluntary early retirement scheme which Coillte introduced last year, but that was not possible in the time allowed.  Regarding the remuneration of the board and the CEO, I understand that the 10% which is being applied to all boards has been applied in that regard.  In the context of the overall borrowing requirement, the CEO's remuneration is obviously not very large.  Although there is a case for considering the remuneration of CEO, it is not necessarily central to this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">Deputy Sherlock mentioned the audit of the Coillte Forestry Stewardship Council.  I take the stewardship council and its views very seriously.  It is something that we raise on a regular basis with Coillte, more frequently, in fact, than in some of the standard meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">Returning to the original question raised by Deputy Creed, which was also raised by Deputy Sherlock, regarding the appearance of Coillte before the committee, I was not present but I read the entire proceedings of the meeting.  That was a while ago and I do not remember the specific detail particularly well.  Nevertheless, if the point being made by Deputies is that any company appearing before an Oireachtas committee ought to be open in respect of the procedure then I very much agree that should be the case.  There is little I can do about it because I am not there on every occasion, except to confirm I would be pleased to appear before the committee on this and related issues.  In addition, I would be pleased to appear before the committee when the review has been completed and to outline anything that may arise.  Alternatively, if the committee seeks to have an input into that review I would be pleased to accommodate such a request if we can find a means to do so.  There is a fundamental point at issue and I agree with the Deputies that the House has a role of scrutiny that should be accommodated.  A space should be provided for it and if it cannot be done between companies and an Oireachtas committee, I would be pleased to facilitate such scrutiny for any of the companies for which I have responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">Deputy Sherlock queried whether the extra borrowing allowed for carbon offsetting measures.  This is a matter I seek to have addressed as part of the review.  I have made it clear to Coillte that its afforestation remit must be considered not so much in the context of this borrowing requirement, but of its strategic plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">Deputy Sheehan complained about the rushed legislation.  There could have been well in excess of two hours for this debate had there not been daft votes on other procedural wrangles.  In any case, none of us has any control over that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1390">I will inform the Deputy why I believe this is the case.  He made the point that we could have waited for the Forestry (Amendment) Bill and that was my initial preference.  He also asked when it was notified.  There has been a concern for a long period that it would be better in this case to have the borrowing requirement in the normal sense rather than under the provision for temporary borrowings.  This matter has be ongoing for the length of time to which Deputy Sheehan adverted, some five or six years or longer.  I would have preferred to address it in the main Bill but I took the view there was an urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">There is another urgency related to the reality of the current situation in the banking sector.  There are two issues for every company — access to borrowing and the cost of such access.  I believe Coillte will be in a more robust position in its dealing with banks when this legislation is, hopefully, passed.  Deputy Sheehan also queried whether the borrowings comply with legislation and my view is that they do so.  He also raised an important point about land use policy, a matter central to one of the reviews under way.  We can discuss that matter in the committee or here at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">Deputy Ferris referred to the need for a more proactive role in afforestation by Coillte.  To be fair to the company, there is a question of land availability and a major question regarding the price of land.  There is also a question because Coillte does not benefit in the way farmers and companies involved in afforestation do with long-term premiums.  It competes with people in a position of considerable financial advantage, something we should keep in mind.  Deputy Ferris also referred to EU planting levels which are vast by comparison with ours.  It is worth remembering that one century ago only 1% of the land surface of Ireland was covered in forestry.  That figure is now 10.5% and there has been considerable State investment in that change, some of which has come from the State and some from Coillte.  We have come along a good deal.  There is a target of 17% and we must find ways to address it.  There are environmental concerns and various land use issues which arise.  Although these are not central to this legislation, we will deal with them in a subsequent debate.  The Deputy also referred to issues of employment, import substitution, increased isolation and farming viability all of which are important issues but none of which are related to the borrowing requirement of Coillte, although they are related to afforestation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_1393">I thank the Minister for his reply.  Let us be clear about the purpose of the amendment.  If I walk into my bank and seek a temporary financial arrangement, it is because I have hit an unforeseen difficulty and I need money to tide me over that.  It is not too great a leap to suggest if Coillte requires money on an temporary basis, it is because of some unforeseen or short-term financial difficulty.  The purpose of the amendment is to restrict the degree to which it can dig in to its overall borrowing requirement or capacity, which we would prefer to be used for solid business investment, for such purposes as increased plantation and increased economic activity that will create jobs and profits for the company and a dividend for the State.  The purpose of the amendment is to acknowledge that in any business there is a time when short-term emergency financial cover is needed, but that Coillte should not fritter away all of its borrowing requirement on that basis.  There should be a sound strategic investment behind the vast majority of any borrowings.  The amendment proposes that Coillte should only have temporary borrowings of up to 25% of the total maximum borrowings and that if the company wishes to exceed €100 million of temporary borrowings, it must have the express approval of Dáil Éireann.  I believe this is a very sensible safeguard not least because we do not have time to tease out all the issues in this legislation, but equally it is a very solid, sensible business proposition because in any circumstances one should not dip into a potential capital fund for investment to deal with short-term or day-to-day financial difficulties, whether to meet incidental expenses on a daily, weekly or monthly basis or to deal with pension issues.  The amendment is a solid proposal which the Minister should consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">When I moved the original amendment I did not refer to the second part which states that money borrowed temporarily at any point in the accounting year should be noted in the annual report of the company for that accounting year.  I do not accept the Minister of State's statement that the level of indebtedness and details to the effect that certain debt was used for purposes X, Y and Z are contained in the annual report.  It does not indicate that €50 million was borrowed for new capital or timber extraction or that €5 million of the temporary borrowing requirement was used to shore up the pension fund.  Such detail is not provided.  I call on the Minister of State to reconsider his statement because such detail is not available in the annual report, although it should be because such safeguards would protect the public purse.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_1395">I refer to the issue of inflation, the 1988 Act and the Minister's response to questions put.  My understanding of the Forestry Act 1988 is that at any one time the aggregate borrowings of the company should not exceed £80 million or €101.5 million in today's money.  The Minister of State stated borrowings had reached €182.5 million in October 2009 and that this is accounted for by inflation.  Perhaps I misunderstood the legislation or I am naive but my understanding is the figures set out in the 1988 Act are finite and definitive and that there is no allowance for inflation within the 1988 Act.  Perhaps my interpretation is wrong and, if so, I will stand corrected.  If borrowings increased beyond the limit at any time between 1988 and 2009 there should have been an amendment to the 1988 Act to facilitate such a change long before now.  The importance of the point is that if the Minister of State allowed for inflation or if such a measure were not in the 1988 Act, then the Government should have amended the legislation long before now and this raises a question over any borrowings in excess of €101.5 million in the intervening period.  Will the Minister of State clarify this for my satisfaction and understanding?</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">I refer to the Fine Gael amendment, which is reasonable because the tone of the debate from the Opposition side of the House has been such to ensure Coillte is subjected to a greater degree of scrutiny.  As we stated, Coillte was before the committee and there was no mention of potential for increasing its borrowing requirement at that stage.  That throws up a question about the role of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  When witnesses from the semi-State sector report to the committee, are they obliged, in the interests of transparency, to let members know what their strategic requirements are, particularly with regard to borrowing?  I ask the Minister of State to respond to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">Questions regarding the remuneration of the chief executive officer and other high-ranking staff were not answered adequately by the Minister of State.  There is a question mark over whether the borrowings are for the purposes of remuneration or to meet deficits in the pension.  I understand the Minister of State said this would be dealt with in further legislation but it is also pertinent to this Bill, in particular, to the amendment put down by Fine Gael and supported by the Labour Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_1398">The aim in the programme for Government is to achieve 17% afforestation.  Are we talking about a particular facility for the semi-State company, and have the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government been involved in drafting a management plan for Coillte's diverse role in the programme for Government for the future?  If they have not, and the Minister of State attempts to give Coillte the facility to borrow this amount of money, it seems as if that body is being allowed to work independently.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock's call for a greater level of accountability to the committee and the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">Perhaps the Minister of State might update the House on the voluntary retirement scheme.  Did Coillte get the numbers for which it had looked?</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">I refer to part of amendment No. 2 which states: "(<i>a</i>) Monies borrowed temporarily at any point in the accounting year under this subsection shall be noted in the annual report.”  This is vital.  We saw that two financial institutions, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, traded loans between one another during the year and the accounting figures at the end of the year showed no sign of it.  By the time it was discovered it was far too late.  We have the right to know about any loans that are borrowed temporarily and repaid during the accounting year.  Perhaps amber or red lights should go up with regard to why this practice took place.  It is common sense that this should be noted in the annual report.  It is vital because there is no point discovering this after the event, when the damage is done.</p>

          <p eId="para_1402">With regard to temporary borrowing and short-term difficulty, as mentioned by Deputy Creed, I am not aware of any difficulty, if such exists.  Headroom is allowed here to deal with a number of proposals under the strategic plan put forward by Coillte.  For example, if one considers the two plants, considerable investment has been put in place already in Medite, with some more required.  Something similar is required in Smartply to make it compatible with the kind of requirements in board quality that would make it capable of competing internationally in the export market.  With regard to the €400 million, the main Bill will be published long before anything close to that is even reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">I appreciate the point the Deputy made with regard to safeguards in the Bill but am concerned that the manner in which it is tabled in this amendment might cut across the requirement, in accounting practice terms, for companies to present their annual reports in a particular way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">Regarding the 1988 Act, raised by Deputy Sherlock,  I understand the provision relied on is section 24(2) which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1405">The company may borrow money (including money in a currency other than the currency of the State) temporarily but the aggregate at any one time of such borrowings shall not exceed such amount as has been approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406">That appears to me to sit separately from the requirement in section 24(1)(<i>a</i>) concerning the overall limit.  They are parallel requirements.  The overall limit is for the other borrowings and this is for the temporary borrowings.  However, temporary became a little long-term and that is what I am trying to address.</p>

Having the detail of the information is important so that people are fully informed.  It may be on the company website but anybody who knows me will know I am not very much into technological material.  However, this is important for the generations who are, who will be able to follow companies, particularly those that purchase their own shares on a stock exchange outside the State.  That is the basic point and it is important.  It will obviously provide very detailed and focused information.  Very often companies complain that the Minister is imposing further bureaucracy and administrative burdens on them.  The Minister is proposing to amend that requirement to publish the price of shares purchased and to provide an alternative method that would require companies to publish only the highest and the lowest prices paid.  Under this amendment one does not have to publish the time of each purchase in order to avoid the necessity for a lengthy list of times and to restrict requirement to the date of the purchase only.  Those are laudable objectives because there is no point in strangling legislation at birth, so to speak.  An issue we frequently discuss in this House is loading legislation with bureaucracy, which is self-defeating in the long term.  This measure brings some common sense to the issue, which I applaud.  The Minister and his officials are right to do this in this area and I will wholeheartedly support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1433">Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, are related.  They make minor adjustments to the new mechanism agreed on Committee Stage last week that will allow certain collective investment fund companies migrate their registered offices into or out of this country without having to first wind up the company in their current jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1434">These Report Stage amendments will amend subsections 6 and 7 of the new section 256G that will be inserted into the Companies Act 1990 by section 3 of this Bill.  All three amendments deal with the court actions that shareholders or creditors can initiate if they wish to halt a planned migration of a fund from Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1435">Before turning to the precise nature of the adjustments contained in the three amendments, I will explain why these proposals are deemed to be of such urgency that they are being addressed by way of Dáil Committee and Report Stage amendments to a Bill that has already been passed in the Seanad.  I have always made the case that amendments should be published in good time to allow them to be examined so that people may decide whether to support them or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1436">The proposals arise in response to a recent approach by the Irish collective investment funds industry who reported that it believes there is currently a short-term window of opportunity for Ireland to attract investment funds business from third countries if our laws were amended to allow funds that are constituted as bodies corporate to migrate here without first having to wind up in their current jurisdiction.  The funds entities in question are seeking to relocate to well-regulated jurisdictions, another critically important point, and Ireland has a well-regulated system in place regarding funds.  This would respond to investor concerns arising from the recent financial turmoil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">As the Government is committed to doing all in its power to facilitate economic growth, and all the more so in the current challenging environment, it resolved to examine and respond to this request as speedily as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1438">Following detailed consultations with the funds industry and with the Financial Regulator and the Companies Registration Office a mechanism has been devised that will facilitate inward and outward migration of funds entities.  This arrangement has appropriate safeguards in place to protect Ireland's reputation as a well regulated fund management centre, and the new mechanism is being restricted to funds whose activities will be or are regulated by the Financial Regulator.  In addition to meeting the short-term window of opportunity identified by the funds industry I should add that this mechanism will also have long-term application and will add to the overall funds regulatory regime available in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1439">In this regard amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, deal with the High Court action that creditors or shareholders may initiate if they wish to halt the deregistration of an outward migrating fund.  Amendment No. 3 will alter lines 12 to 15 of page 16 of the Bill as passed by the select committee last week.  This amendment will add the migrating company and the Central Bank to the list of parties on whom notice must be served when a creditor or a shareholder applies to court to halt the deregistration in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1440">At present the Bill provides that notice must be served on the CRO and fund creditors, but there is merit in the migrating company being served with notice, given that its proposed migration will be the subject of a court case.  I believe there is also merit in putting the Central Bank or Financial Regulator on notice as it is they who will have supervised the fund up to this point and it is they who will make a decision in the first instance on whether to allow an outward migration.  This may put them in possession of facts that would be valuable to a court in arriving at its decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1441">Amendment No. 4 — to be inserted between lines 39 and 40 of the same page of the Bill — also gives the migrating company and the Central Bank the right to participate fully in the court hearing.  This should ensure that the court has access to all relevant facts before it makes a decision on whether to make an order in the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1442">Amendment No. 5 seeks to give guidance to the court about the issues it should take into account in making its decision. The amendment provides that in order to halt proceedings, the court will have to be satisfied that the deregistration would not only be detrimental to the petitioning creditors or shareholders, but that it would also be materially prejudicial to the creditors of the fund taken as a whole, or to the shareholders of the funds taken as a whole, or to both the creditors and shareholders taken as a whole.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_1443">According to the European Fund and Asset Management Association, Ireland is the fifth largest investment funds jurisdiction in the EU behind countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Luxembourg.  If we consider jurisdictions in terms of the international distribution of funds rather than the sale of funds, Ireland is the second largest investment funds jurisdiction in the EU behind Luxembourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">The rationale put forward by the Minister of State is that many of the countries that recently joined the EU have now become extremely competitive in this regard.  They are actively trying to develop an investment funds industry and establish themselves as a place of domicile in an attempt to attract business for the more established jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">On the previous occasion the Minister of State spoke to us he indicated there was significant revenue involved and that each fund attracted to be domiciled here results in the creation of an additional one and a half jobs but in the past five years, from 2004 to 2008, the net number of funds established in Luxembourg was approximately 1,400 whereas we lost funds in that regard.  We have lost out on an opportunity to create jobs and that is why we must move with the times.  It is necessary to ensure that we in Ireland improve our investment funds flow offering to ensure we become the regulated funds domicile of choice for international asset managers, and that is what the Minister of State is trying to do.  We must offer an environment and a base that is as competitive as possible and that we match what is on offer in other competing jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">In that regard we must keep abreast of what is happening.  The Minister of State has tabled amendments which amend part of the new section 256G that will be inserted into the Companies Act 1990 by section 3 of the Bill.  The amendments will alter section 256G and sub-sections (6) and (7), both of which deal with procedure connected with the court cases that can be initiated by the shareholders or creditors who have a desire to halt the deregistration of funds coming from the Irish companies register.  It is important that facility is available.  The Minister is doing that in amendment No. 3 by adding the migrating company and the Central Bank or Financial Regulator to the list of parties to whom notice must be served when a creditor or a shareholder applies to the court under section 256G.  Until now notice had to be served on the Companies Registration Office and on the company creditors.  There is much merit in including the migrating company to ensure it will be served with the relevant notice, given that any proposal on migration companies would be subject to a court case or the potential of a court case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">If supervisory jurisdiction is to be vested in the Central Bank or the Financial Regulator it is important that they would also have the appropriate and adequate notice to invoke their jurisdictional and supervisory powers to deal with the funds. A decision must be made in the first instance with regard to whether the outward migration should be allowed.  The matter will then become subject to a court.</p>
          <p eId="para_1448">Amendment No. 4 gives the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and the migrating company the right to participate fully in any court hearings.  That is extremely important because the courts should not be making decisions in the abstract, with only one side of the argument being heard.  The amendment is extremely important because it will give the court access to all the relevant details and facts before it makes a decision on whether to make an appropriate order in any case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1449">Amendment No. 5 is also important and the courts should take note of it, particularly in commercial law cases.  The amendment gives some direction or assistance to the courts in respect of the factors or issues that should be taken into account when they are making their decisions.  The courts should be given as much guidance as possible, particularly as they are always trying to divine what the Oireachtas intended when it passed certain legislation.  They have used literal, teleological and schematic interpretations in the past and they have the power to consider what is said in these Houses in debates on legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1450">The amendments will add to the Bill.  In that context, I wholeheartedly support them.</p>

          <p eId="para_1451">The courts have even considered the content of the Second Stage contributions of Deputies and Members of the Upper House in order to discover the intention behind legislation.  The Second Stage debate often frames the overall direction legislation takes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452">The funds industry is critically important and approximately 10,000 people are employed in it.  Some 26,000 or 27,000 people are employed in the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  The reputation of the country is also critically important.  As Minister of State with responsibility for trade, I am in a position to state that the IFSC is internationally recognised as a fine centre of its kind.  The regulation which governs the way the IFSC operates is extremely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">There has been turmoil in the financial markets in recent times.  As a result, it is important that a message be conveyed internationally to the effect that the IFSC is a good place to do business — particularly in view of the fact that there is proper regulation and that proper oversight and governance mechanisms are in place there — and that it is competitive.  When people consider where they wish to locate funds, establish headquarters, etc., we hope they will look favourably on Ireland in the context of what it has to offer, namely, Greenwich mean time applies here, we have good connectivity with the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and the populace speaks English.  These are great advantages in the context of promoting the IFSC as a place in which to locate operations, etc.  The Government and the relevant State agencies will be doing everything in their power to promote the centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_1454">It is important that legislation to facilitate the migration of investment funds into the country should be in place.  If there is only one-way traffic, companies will be extremely reluctant to locate here in the first instance.  We must, therefore, be in a position to facilitate inward migration.  If companies are willing to move in, they will also like to know that they can move out again if they so wish.  We must get the balance right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">Amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, demonstrate that we are serious with regard to ensuring that proper governance and oversight mechanisms and proper regulations are in place.  They will also ensure that funds companies will be notified in respect of proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1456">The Deputy is correct in stating that we do not want to be overly prescriptive in the context of directing the courts and imposing on them a narrow focus.  However, we want to be able to indicate clearly the intention behind the legislation.  A court must be satisfied that a deregistration would not only be detrimental to the petitioning creditors or shareholders but that it will also be materially prejudicial to the interests of shareholders and creditors or both taken as whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">The Bill has evolved during its passage through the Houses.  It was never intended to rush through Committee or Report Stage amendments in either House.  Representations were made to the Department, which wanted to respond and that is why the Bill evolved.  Another factor in its evolution relates to the changing circumstances internationally and the turmoil that arose.  Opportunities now exist in the context of the movement of funds and the volatility that exists.  Financial services companies want to establish operations in secure centres that are well regulated and recognised internationally.  Ireland is so recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">If the Chair will indulge me, I wish to refer to an amendment that was ruled out of order.  It is important to state that in the context of generally accepted accounting principles in the US and with regard to the Minister to be in a position to make an order in respect of other jurisdictions where such principles hold sway, primary legislation was mentioned as being a necessity.  In that context, section 2(4) states, "Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House".  The Minister may make an order in respect of accounting practices other than those used in the US.  In that context, strict criteria are laid down with regard to the accounting practices that can be used.  In addition, the Bill promotes democratic accountability and this should meet the concerns raised by Deputies.  Orders must be laid before the Houses and either House can reject an order within a set period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">I would like the Bill to pass through the Houses with full cross-party support.  This will send out a strong message with regard to Ireland as a location where high standards of corporate governance apply across the board.  That is critically important in the context of where we are trying to place Ireland internationally in respect of attracting funds and also foreign direct investment and the job creation, etc., that flows therefrom.  I hope I have allayed the concerns expressed by Deputies in the context of the Minister having powers that are too wide-ranging or being in a position to make up his own rules.  As regards the latter, my officials would certainly never allow me to make up my own rules.  In the interests of democratic accountability, it will be necessary for the Minister to lay any orders before both Houses.</p>

          <p eId="para_1472">The intention behind the Bill, namely, to facilitate companies which may wish to establish headquarters here, attract funds and other matters.  Everyone in the House must support that intention.  However, I wish to record my party's concerns in respect of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1473">The first of these relates to the powers of the Minister.  I have been a Member of the House for almost three years and I have yet to witness a statutory instrument being challenged by resolution of the House.  The way in which secondary legislation is dealt with is inadequate.  Due to other demands, we would never use Private Members' time to deal with such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474">I have a number of concerns with regard to the country's reputation.  I was encouraged by the comments made yesterday by the Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland in respect of this matter.  We must ensure that we do everything possible to restore the country's reputation.  In that context, we must be extremely careful with regard to responding too quickly to corporate-driven legislation.  There has been a great deal of discussion with regard to developer-driven planning.  In many instances, corporations tend to drive certain items of legislation.  The introduction of such a substantial amendment at such a late stage is an example of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475">As a result of the assurances we have been given by everyone I contacted about the matter, including Revenue and others, I am happy to allow the Bill to pass.  However, it is important to put on the record the concerns my party has about how secondary legislation is produced, the ministerial powers granted in this Bill, the fact other accounting procedures are recognised and an amendment came so late, and re-emphasise the importance which must be attached to proper regulation.  If we are encouraging companies to come here from Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, we must ensure they are coming here in order to improve their reputations not to damage ours.</p>

          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_1476">I have my own reservations about secondary legislation.  I have argued about it in regard to the Diseases of Animals Act in 2001 and the 1966 Act.  Many of these issues can be dealt with in the consolidation Bill.  It is important that is put in place.  The powers of the Minister to make regulations are somewhat circumscribed, in terms of designating other accounting standards for use by a specified category of parent undertakings incorporated in Ireland.  The measures are purely transitional.  There is a time limit and a defined period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">I agree with Deputy Varadkar.  We are all snowed under.  Sometimes a statutory instrument is introduced by secondary legislation and we do not have time to scrutinise it, which is part of the problem.  Perhaps it should be laid before the committee and we should work out a separate way of dealing with it.  It could be laid before the House formally and then transferred for scrutiny by the committee, which can assess the situation and determine how many companies have applied.  It will be entitled to determine the circumstances regarding the qualifying companies and there is a restricted period of four years.  It will all be brought to an end on 31 December 2015.  The Minister will apply the same standard to the United States as will be applied to everyone else.  The measure may not be applicable, which is fair enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1478">I hope there will not be extensive recourse to section 2.  I agree with Deputy Varadkar that our reputation is of the utmost importance.  The jobs in this sector are high quality and are at the upper end of the market.  We need to keep our scrutiny, supervisory and financial control sections in place.  There is a fair degree of scrutiny and supervisory jurisdiction being inserted in this Bill.  We have a belt and braces approach.  I would be surprised if issues arose regarding companies.  We are a place of domicile in terms of funds and our jurisdiction and supervisory regime is such that, because of our reputation, people want to come here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">The reason there is a significant amount of volatility as a result of the world financial crisis is that funds are now looking for homes, which they will only look for where they can be guaranteed that there is certainty, scrutiny, supervision and significant Government controls asserted through the legislative framework.  It is important that our reputation is accentuated.  Some of the amendments which were tabled were late and I accept the Minister's bona fides in that regard.  The amendments stitched into the Bill improved the situation significantly.  I am taking everything at face value.  I know the Bill had to be passed before the end of the year and it is now ready to go.</p>

The thrust of this amendment is to make the breach of the conditions of a licence an offence.  Section 10 creates an offence for providing an unlicensed service, but there is no offence for breaching the terms of a licence once it has been granted.  There is a <i>carte blanche</i> in that respect.  Regulatory experience shows clearly that the breaches of the terms under which it is provided are much more frequent than instances of unapproved services being offered.  Penalties need to be extended to punish breaches of the terms of the licence.</p>

As a matter of policy it is not considered appropriate that the breach of the condition of a licence should be an offence.  The powers contained in the Bill to ensure compliance with the conditions of a licence are adequate for that purpose.  The possible revocation, suspension or amendment of a licence provides a strong incentive for service providers to be compliant.  The offence provision for operating an unlicensed premium rate service is intended to incentivise intending premium rate service providers to obtain a licence for such services.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1496">In page 10, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1497">"(2) Where a premium rate service provider contravenes <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Commission shall establish a speedy mechanism to ensure redress for the consumer.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498">This is also consumer-oriented to ensure the consumer has access to the most speedy resolution and adequate redress regarding any complaint.  The amendment seeks to address the fact the Bill seems to be primarily focused on the courts, with no simple remedy for the consumer who has been charged inappropriately.  The amendment proposes a mechanism other than the courts for redress — that may be a bigger problem and the courts might be the first port of call.  We have advocated the use of the small claims court to resolve various other disputes.  It can be hard to get access to the courts because of long waiting lists.  It can be time consuming and costly.  The thrust of the amendment is to try to facilitate that aspect.</p>

          <p eId="para_1499">I look forward to the Minister's response on these amendments.  Young people often receive unsolicited premium rate text messages.  They may occur on a regular basis without their consent because once they receive the message and accept it, other messages are likely to follow and they can build up a substantial bill without knowing it.  Redress through courts is not easy and can be very expensive.  The matter is of concern to me and my party.</p>

          <p eId="para_1500">I shall deal with the amendments in turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_1501">I cannot accept amendment No. 27.  As I stated on Committee Stage, the purpose of section 11 is to prevent overcharging for premium rate services or for charging for services that were not requested or for services that were not supplied.  A similar provision is made in the principal Act in respect of telecommunications services.  The issues mentioned in the proposed amendment are matters that are more appropriately addressed in the terms and conditions of a licence rather than in primary legislation.  Where a service provider breaches any of these conditions, the provisions under sections 7 and 8 will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1502">I also cannot accept amendment No. 28.  As I stated on Committee Stage, there is an existing mechanism under section 44 of the principal Act that enables a more speedy redress for the consumer.  That section provides that if a person, who is alleged to have committed an offence, remedies to the satisfaction of the commission within 21 days of being notified of the alleged offence the matter giving rise to the offence and pays to the commission €1,500, the person will not be prosecuted for the offence.  This mechanism applies to all summary offences under the principal Act and will also apply to this Bill when enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1503">I also cannot accept amendment No. 29.  As I stated on Committee Stage, the maximum financial penalty that can be imposed by the District Court is €5,000.  Regarding reimbursement, I amended the Bill on Committee Stage to provide that where a service provider is convicted summarily of an offence under this section, the court may on application to it by the commission order that any charge wrongly imposed on the end user be repaid by the service provider concerned.  That gives real power for the commission via the court procedure to ensure that refunds are paid.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1670">I thank my officials for their work on this Bill.  It has been complex on the fibre optic ducting side and crucially in dealing with how to regulate premium rate services.  I am pleased that we have been able to pass legislation that will have a real effect and do the job we are supposed to do, protecting the public.  We have all received submissions from people, often young people, who have been subjected to scams by tapping into a ringtone or some other premium rate service without understanding that extortionate charges would be applied.  Our ability to protect consumers from that sort of illegal behaviour is important.  It encourages confidence in the State in commercial transactions and the rule of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1671">This Bill allows us to protect consumers from such scams through legislation.  It enables them to get refunds when they have been unduly charged, and enables us to stop companies engaging in such practices.  It is important legislation.  It continues the good work done by Regtel but gives it a real legal effect as it moves under the remit of ComReg.</p>
          <p eId="para_1672">I thank the Deputies opposite for assisting in the development of the Bill.  They tabled several progressive amendments which improve it.  I look forward to seeing action on the basis of these legislative changes from ComReg and across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_1673">I thank the Minister and his officials for their co-operation with the Bill.  He might not have done everything we wanted him to do but he met us part of the way.  I agree with the Minister's comments but another group who should benefit from this Bill are older people who did not grow up in a technological era and have suffered from premium costs because they responded to messages and received ongoing unsolicited messages which cost a lot of money.  Compensation claims also cost a great deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1675">I thank the Minister for bringing forward an important Bill because consumer protection must ensure that people get the best service and do not have to accept or pay for services they did not seek in the first place.  That is a very important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1676">Deputy McManus had been strongly advocating amendments to ensure that refunds would be made.  The absence of such a provision was a weakness on the early Stages.  Deputy McManus has championed that across the political and public arenas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1677">This is an important Bill.  I had very little input into it but our spokesperson on telecommunications did.  I hope the Minister will keep an eye on this matter because if new defects come to light it is important that somebody is ready and able to take up the baton to accept that there are inadequacies and be able to deal with them.  While ComReg will issue reports and so on I hope that if some irregularity appears at the end of an annual report steps will be taken to remedy that, promote consumer interests and put consumer protection at the top of the agenda.</p>

The Minister of State has indicated his intention to ask the Chair to direct the Clerk to make a correction to the Bill under Standing Order 136.  The correction is as follows: In page 10 of the Bill, line 27, to move the comma that appears after the word "by" where it secondly occurs and place it at the end of that line.

          <p eId="para_1680">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1681">The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission came into being on 1 January 2004.  The commission is composed of 11 members under the chairmanship of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is an <i>ex officio</i> member, as is the Clerk of the Dáil, who also has the title of Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There are also seven ordinary members, four from the Dáil and three from the Seanad, who are appointed by the Members of each House, and one representative of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1682">The responsibilities of the commission include the payment of the salaries and allowances of Deputies and Senators, the payment of the salaries of staff, including Members' staff, the payment of certain pensions and the provision of other necessary facilities to enable the business of both Houses to be transacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1683">Since its inception, the commission has overseen the smooth running of services in both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, and has instituted a number of significant improvements in the services provided to Members.  Among these was the creation of the new research service for Members which was a major development.  This involved increasing the library staff of about 12 by a further 20 to create a research service modelled on international standards.  I am told that this has been used by over 90% of Members in the current Dáil and all feedback indicates that it is highly regarded by Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1684">The primary purpose of this Bill is to make available the funding for the commission over the coming three years.  The current funding comes to an end on 31 December 2009.  The Bill proposes in section 6 to make available to the commission a sum not exceeding €360 million to carry out its functions for the three year period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012.  This sum has been agreed with the commission and takes into account foreseen expenditure.  While it is less than the €393 million provided for the past three years, it must be seen in the context of the current budgetary situation.  The proposed funding carefully balances the needs of the commission with the availability of resources during the period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1685">Members will be well aware that the financial provision for public services will be under severe budgetary pressure in the coming years.  With this in mind, the Government will expect there to be a reduced drawdown by the commission from central funds in 2010 onwards as a result of savings on pay arising from the public service pay reductions announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech of 9 December last.</p>
          <p eId="para_1686">In addition to the financial provisions, the Bill provides for renaming the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas as the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  The purpose of this is to strengthen the identity of the service.  Members will be aware that the public, and indeed parts of the public service, often find it hard to appreciate the distinction between the elected Members of the Houses, the commission and the administrative staff of the commission, and their respective roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1687">The distinct role of the Civil Service staff and senior management structures of the Oireachtas are specifically recognised in the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959.  These structures have served both Houses extremely well and remained in place following the establishment of the commission in 2003.  However, significant changes in Civil Service management systems have taken place in the 50 years since the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959 came into force and it is accepted that the configuration in that Act, particularly in terms of senior management structures, needs to be modernised.  In that regard, the Minister for Finance is committed to ensuring, in co-operation with the commission, that the administrative structures of the Oireachtas do not become out of step with Civil Service norms in terms of adapting flexibly to the needs and demands of modern management practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1688">The renaming of the office comprising the staff of the Houses as an entity now to be known as the Houses of the Oireachtas Service does not affect the operations of the service or its relationship with the commission under the 2003 Act.  The commission retains all the powers and functions conferred by that Act.  However, the change in title may facilitate further development of the service and closer integration of the service with the commission as its governing body in future legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1689">Section 2 provides for this renaming while section 14 and the Schedule, Parts 1 and 2, update the references to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas in other Acts and statutory instruments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1690">The Bill includes some technical amendments to the existing legislation and I would like to take the opportunity to present them briefly to the House.  Section 3 sets out the advice and support function of the newly named service, which is identical to that currently carried out by the office.  Section 4 sets out, in greater detail than heretofore, the functions of the commission in providing for the running of the Houses and its policy-determining and oversight roles.  It also includes new measures clarifying the commission's accountability to the Houses for the performance of its functions and its obligation to secure value for money in the use of resources.  Finally, the section also clarifies that the charge to be levied by the commission under the existing legislation for the provision of certain services and facilities to outgoing Members following a dissolution of the Dáil is to be for the period of dissolution only.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">Section 5 is a new provision for the drawing up of a code of conduct for commission members.  While they are already covered by other codes, these are not specific to their role as members of the commission, and a uniform code is desirable in the interests of good governance.  The purpose of section 7 is to bring the process for removal of a commission member more into line with that used for Oireachtas committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1692">The 2003 Act specified that Oireachtas staff who were civil servants before the establishment day continued to be civil servants after that day but did not legislate specifically for those appointed subsequently.  Section 8 amends the original section to include both categories in the civil servant classification.  The objective of section 9 is to amend the original legislation to provide a statutory basis for the procedures to be followed by the commission if a Supplementary Estimate is required in any year.  This is in line with current practice since the establishment of the commission.  Section 10 is a new provision setting out the role, membership and functions of the audit committee.  The commission's audit committee is currently established on a non-statutory basis and has been in place since 2004.  The section reflects the current membership and practice with the exception that it proposes that the commission may appoint up to three external members where currently it has two.</p>
          <p eId="para_1693">I wish to draw attention to one amendment that was made in this section by the Seanad.  This was to insert a new subsection (10)(<i>b</i>) to state, effectively, that, in addition to advising the Secretary General on financial matters, the audit committee shall also advise the commission on matters of corporate governance relating to its functions.  The subsection in question provides that the audit committee reports to the commission on its activities at least once a year.  The Minister for Finance was happy to propose this amendment and I believe Deputies will agree that it makes for an improved Bill in that the commission members will be fully advised by the audit committee on all corporate governance matters within its areas of responsibility.  I should, at this stage, recognise the contribution of Senator Joe O’Toole in framing this particular amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">Section 11, which replaces section 15 of the 2003 Act, updates the provisions of that legislation by designating the Clerk of Dáil Éireann as Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service and chief executive of the commission.  It also designates the Secretary General as the officer accountable for the commission's accounts.  Section 12 expands on the Secretary General's functions as set out in the 2003 Act, including accountability to the commission for ensuring economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of commission resources and the preparation a statement of values for the service.  The section also clarifies the Secretary General's role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the commission in relation to various other statutory functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1695">Section 13 restates the commission's responsibilities in relation to injury claims made by secretarial assistants employed by Oireachtas members or political parties.  It also repeals the relevant sections of earlier Acts which it supersedes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696">The usual definitions, Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions are contained in sections 1 and 15.  It is intended that the Bill will come into effect on 1 January next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1697">Most of the proposed changes are minor or technical in nature.  They are intended to give greater clarity and functionality to the legislation underpinning the service on which we all rely.  Deputies will appreciate that the process of updating the legislation is an ongoing one.  I have no doubt that in a few years time other, and possibly more significant, changes including, as I have signalled, to the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959, will be required to keep up to date with best practice and developments in the way our parliamentary business is done and wider developments in public service management.  The three-yearly budgetary process is valuable not just in facilitating financial planning, but also in giving an opportunity to reflect on the adequacy of the structures underpinning the management of our institutions and their funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">To conclude, the Bill is designed to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to continue to provide the services which have facilitated both Houses in the carrying out of their work over the past six years and to facilitate the further development of those services.  I believe Members will agree that these objectives are worth pursuing.  It is important also to point out that the changes proposed in this Bill have been approved by the commission.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_449">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1699">This is one of the rare occasions when we get the opportunity to ask pretty fundamental questions about ourselves and whether politics in Ireland is fit for purpose.  It is a very important question at the moment, because so much change needs to be made in this country that politics alone can lead.  It is a unique situation whereby getting ourselves out of the economic and social problems we have is down to leadership from within the public rather than the private sector.  This will indicate the extent to which we can successfully transform the way we manage public utilities and public services and measure the extent to which we can solve our problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1700">We need to look very hard at ourselves as part of this debate.  As the Minister of State knows, I have tabled an amendment in the name of the Fine Gael Party asking that we should provide just enough money for nine months, during which period there would be a review of the extent to which we are delivering value effectively for the money we spend.  The Minister of State will know that over the past five years the staffing levels within the Houses have increased by 43%.  There are the same number of politicians, but the budget has increased by 65%, equivalent to €54 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">Some €33 million of that increase comes from the increased administration cost of running the Houses.  We are running a big business here, which is using up substantially more resources than it has traditionally done.  That is not necessarily good or bad, but the question is whether we are managing our affairs in a way that would square up to best practice in a modern, effective parliament.  Sadly, people watching this debate would not give the Oireachtas top marks for being an effective parliament.  They might even wonder if politics can ever provide the sort of leadership to get us out of the problems we face.  That is sad, but true.</p>
          <p eId="para_1702">We face much scepticism and cynicism about our operations, but we have brought a lot of these problems on ourselves.  We have allowed much of the real power that should reside in this House to slip away in various ways.  Unfortunately, however, we have discovered that in many cases the power that slipped away from us was abused.  We have been caught napping in respect of our responsibilities.  I am not picking out the current Government, but the Executive has to bear a lot of the responsibility for this.  The Executive has been quite content to use a strong Whips' system and guillotines.  It has also been content to use consultants and the protection of freedom of information legislation on those consultancies in order to remove from public scrutiny much of what any parliament ought to be doing as a routine exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1703">In the last Dáil it went to a ridiculous extent whereby virtually every Government backbencher was on the Executive's payroll in one shape or form, as a chair, vice-chair or convenor.  That has been part of the problem because the Executive preferred not to be subject to scrutiny and wanted a dumbed-down Parliament.  The courts have also clipped our wings and this is arising again now with the suggestion that we should investigate what happened in the banking system.  Parliament has been curtailed by the courts, which decided that if the Oireachtas is conducting an investigation, we cannot make any adverse finding against an individual.  In my view, our power has been usurped, although I have the protection of the House.  The worthy judges on the Supreme Court have made a decision and we have been constrained as a result of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1704">Another way in which we have been damaged as a parliament, and offer less value for money, is by the Government's lazy habit of setting up an agency for every problem.  That has blind-sided the Dáil in many cases.  We saw the establishment of the HSE and FÁS, which are bodies that cannot be held to proper scrutiny in the House.  They are not answerable to the Dáil in any sense.  We have now discovered that many of the 250 additional quangos that were set up by the Government over the last decade have vague mandates and weak accountability.  Parliamentary accountability has almost disappeared and been destroyed as a result of that trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705">Similarly, we have had the establishment of the social partnership network with ever more elaborate procedures to deal with legislation that ought to be dealt with here.  In many cases, debates about the distribution of power and resources within our community have migrated away from the Oireachtas, which is elected by the people, into the social partnership arrangements.  Those arrangements are currently in abeyance.  The issue is not the value of social partnership, however, but the accountability of decision making that properly belongs to Parliament.  We have been edged out in so many of these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706">Happily, the Fourth Estate is not with us, but changing media coverage has obviously altered the way the Dáil works.  It is theatrics which catch the media eye.  We do not have to cast our minds back too far to see how one phrase dominated coverage of a particular debate, which imposed cuts worth hundreds of millions of euro on some of the most vulnerable sections of our community.  Yet if an outsider watched what the Dáil was doing that day, they would think it was presiding over some sort of circus.  I think that has damaged us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707">The Oireachtas is demanding 65% more in resources than it did five years ago, but in every one of these areas we are witnessing less genuine product and less scrutiny.  The Oireachtas is less able to hold power to account, which is the vital role.  We need to look at value for money in a crude accountancy sense by asking how many people are doing different staff exercises, whether there is duplication and if people are employed to best effect.  In addition, however, we must also question the purposes and extent to which the Dáil has let itself slip into lazy patterns, thus allowing power to move away from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1708">We now face real challenges and must do three things as a result.  First, we have to follow the money, which is something we have abysmally failed to do.  Second, we must hold power to account, which we have also failed to do.  Third, we must offer some leadership at this time.  The old phrase "money talks" is correct.  We have a bizarre situation whereby we decide our budgets not on the basis of whether agencies are delivering high performance, but on what they got last year.  Agencies come in here with plus or minus 1% or 2%, which is their Estimate for next year.  When we make decisions on what we will assign to different agencies, we are not presented with any information about the targets they are setting for themselves or their delivery in the past year.  Agencies do not bid for money based on the value of their performance, but on the basis of what they did last year.  That is totally unacceptable in a modern parliamentary system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1709">One may ask why the public service has not reformed itself, but I am asking why the Oireachtas has not changed the way it assigns money.  If so, we could for once start to reward agencies and managers who deliver high performance.  We could recognise that in the way we assign our money.  The Government predominantly dictates the way in which we assess how money is spent in this House, but that Dickensian system must change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710">I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I have seen things get worse, not better.  I have seen taxation and expenditure measures being brought in on the same day, yet that was trumpeted as a new system of budgetary accountability.  What a joke.  It meant that both spending and tax were then veiled by the secrecy of the budget.  Previously, we got at least two weeks when we saw the spending proposals before the budget debate.  There was some semblance of a debate about what the choices were, albeit a truncated and inadequate one.  It is ludicrous to vote money through the budget when it will be a further six months before Departments bestir themselves to tell us what targets they might have.  We will complete our study of those half way through the year in which the money has already been spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1711">On behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Rabbitte offered a model for changing that, but it was met by a stony silence on the Government side of the House.  It is not good enough to give them bread and circuses, having the Oireachtas amply provided with resources, but not give it the tasks it needs to undertake.  There has to be a change in the way we spend public money.  Equally, there must be a change in the way the Oireachtas holds power to account.  Powerful interests in this society have not been held up to probing scrutiny whatsoever.  Instead they have been greeted with accepting faith by regulators, by and large.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712">Recently, I listened to the ESB regulator saying why costs were going up there — it was because the ESB said its costs were going up and therefore the regulator put the prices up.  What sort of scrutiny or regulation is that?  A regulator is obliged to look beneath those facts and challenge the costs to see if we are competitive and effective in doing what other agencies do.  We know we are not.  We have one of the most expensive electricity systems.  The same is true with regard to the effectiveness of our banking system.  We thought we had regulators who were regulating and riding shotgun on the banks, but the banks increased credit at breathtaking speed.  Every red light of banking was on, but nothing was done about the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">The Oireachtas may criticise others — I agree they hold the primary responsibility — but we need to learn from what has happened.  We must institute systems where the Oireachtas will genuinely hold people to account.  It must hold the regulators to account.  We should vet the appointment of people to these positions.  We should vet the boards that represent the State in spending these moneys.  These areas should be vetted.  It is not some outrageous request from the Oireachtas or some attempt to set up a Star Chamber to expect that people would be willing to come before the representatives of taxpayers before they take up a post.  They should have a mandate that is meaningful to the Oireachtas and be seen to be people with adequate skills to do the job.  However, we are denied that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">We need to supervise the budgets these agencies get.  We need to set performance standards for them and to be able to verify at the end of the year that they measured up to those standards.  We need to force these agencies to compare themselves to international benchmarks of best practice.  When the financial services legislation was being debated in the House, I remember saying to the then Minister, Charlie McCreevy, that he had just put a bulldog clip around the regulations we had in the past and presented them to a new agency and said that was best practice.  The regulations were never examined to check whether they squared up to international best practice at the time.  That task was not done because the public service has allowed itself to be dumbed down and hollowed out by all these agencies it has set up.  Now it does not have the capacity to evaluate what they are doing.  We must pull that power back into the public service and into a system that is accountable here in the House.  We seriously need to pull ourselves up in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715">To return to the issue of the allocation of resources in the House, I agree we have doubled administration, but to what extent has that increased the forensic work of holding power to account, holding budgets to account and demanding standards of performance from those who work on our behalf?  The answer is that it has only done so to a very limited extent.   The Minister of State praised the resources in the Oireachtas Library, but the library is a long way from the cutting edge of parliamentary accountability.  We need closer accountability with regard to resources and need genuine parliamentary accountability in the House.  We have had too many years operating in a comfort zone and must strip that away now.  We must recognise that governments are fallible and the role we have in holding governments to account is an important part of political accountability that we have allowed become derailed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716">It requires Government to change this also.  It is unacceptable that large agencies of the scale of the HSE and FÁS are not accountable to the House in a meaningful fashion and that we cannot demand access to information.  Every Deputy will admit we do not get this accountability.  We need to equip the House to do that important work.  As we have learned in recent times, the failure to do that work adequately has had enormous consequences for us.  For that reason, I feel strongly that we need to look beyond some sort of accountant coming in and conducting a slide rule exercise on what we do.  That is not the sort of review I want.  It is part of what we need, but a much bigger part is deciding on best practice for parliamentary scrutiny.  We must ask how we get from where we are — the bottom of the fourth division in my view — to the top of the first division.  In the Lemass-Whittaker era, politics changed events.  Politics set a new vision, made new demands and drove a new way of doing things.  We are in a similar situation now.  If politicians do not step up to plate now and are not willing to do things differently, we will fail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717">This Bill, slipped in as it is at the end of the session, unfortunately, prevents what I believe is a much more important debate.  With the utmost respect to the Minister of State, it should not be handled by a junior Minister.  This Bill deals with the core of governance.  The question is whether the Oireachtas can square up to the challenge of governance.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, well and I think he would probably agree on the need to change many things.  He would also agree we have seen a slow bicycle race on the issue of reform.  For as long as I have been here, we have seen the issue of reform sidetracked.  I do not blame any particular Administration for that.  When one gets on the Government side of the House, one tends to wonder why the opportunity to scrutinise should be given to the Opposition when one did not have that opportunity oneself when in opposition.  Perhaps this is the time, when the Fianna Fáil Administration is probably facing its dying period in government and faces, forcibly or otherwise, a period in opposition, to make changes that would provide a decent job to Members on both sides of the House.  While I do not believe the Minister of State is empowered to provide the reform, I hope the wisdom of the former Ceann Comhairle, who intends to speak, will prevail upon others to see the need to change if we want to square up to these challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718">This is something about which I feel strongly.  Perhaps this runs in the family because when my brother was here, he also felt strongly about it.  There is much undone business in the area of reform, for example, with regard to the spending of public money.  In the 1980s, when we did not have two farthings to rub together, we introduced programme expenditure reporting, which ensured we could see how much was going to something such as the apprenticeship programme, what the output of that programme was, the cost per person trained, and the placement success of the programme.  At a time when we did not have two pence to rub together, we were able to do that.  That only lasted two years before some gremlins in the Department of Finance decided it was too expensive.  Is it not some reflection on priorities that it was too expensive to give us information on what our money was achieving?  The same people have allowed power to slip out to agencies without proper mandates or accountability, which has damaged the country.  We must now rethink this.  McCarthy has offered us an agenda.  He proposed closing down 43 agencies, affecting some hundreds of bodies.  That is only the start.  We must genuinely reform the way we do our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1719">I apologise for going on for longer than I should have, but it is important we take a hard look at the Houses over the nine month period our amendment suggests.  I hope the Minister of State will accept our amendment and will return to his colleagues and say it is about more than just finding some consultant to go into the Oireachtas Commission with a slide rule to tell us we should trim this or that agency or replace somebody doing two jobs with one person.  This is about examining what the Oireachtas is about, its task and how to deploy its resources to deliver that task effectively.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_450">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1720">I will share time with Deputy Morgan, if he comes into the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1721">The essential and main thrust of the Bill is about providing a triennial budget for the administration of the Houses of the Oireachtas, replenishing the budget and making an estimate in terms of the costs of administration of the Houses of the Oireachtas over the coming three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722">I am a serving member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The budget provides for something in the order of an 8.5% reduction over the forthcoming three years.  I believe this will turn out to be more than an 8.5% reduction.  The finances are being well husbanded at present and the projections in the report of an bord snip nua will be realised within the three-year term.  The objective of reducing the number of staff by 42 will be easily met.  There will be almost 30 fewer staff by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1723">Since November 2008, the commission has been considering savings.  As the outturn for the end of this calendar year shows, significant savings have been identified and have accrued.  There will be fewer staff.  The commission is currently engaged in the process of considering the McCarthy report line by line in so far as it relates to the cost of servicing the two Houses of Parliament.  Further savings may be identified as a result of that exercise, which is being taken seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1724">The projections of the authors of the McCarthy report will be met easily but, as Deputy Bruton says, that is neither here nor there in one sense.  It is important that there be value for money and efficiency in the administration of the services to the Houses.  It is important that the Houses, more than anywhere else, take the McCarthy report seriously, even if the Ministers do not.  That the Ministers do not is clear because six have gone public to disown it and eight more do not know about its existence.  It is left to the Minister for Finance to thumb through it, which is all he has managed to do so far.  This does not excuse the Houses from considering it seriously to determine what is in it of merit.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is in the process of doing so and has done considerable work in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1725">One would think from public commentary that the only purpose of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is to look after the expenses and allowances of Members.  This is a gross distortion of the work it is concerned with.  Not too long ago, while listening to the radio while driving to work, I heard my friend and colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, telling Pat Kenny I was going through the expense items of the former chairman of the commission, approving his foreign trips and generally getting him to check in with me to approve his telephone bills and various other details.  While I could not see the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan's face as he was on the radio, I believe he said this without batting an eyelid.  It was no bother to him.  He told the nation that whatever expenses had been incurred were due to my negligence and failure to monitor the laundry list of the previous chairman.  That kind of commentary does not help paint a proper picture of the role of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1726">The main items that have contributed to the increasing costs incurred by the commission are the enhancement of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service.  Members have generally been very appreciative of the improvements.  I do not know how much these services are used.  Reading the Seanad debate, I did not find much evidence.  Senators White and Bradford may have referred to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service but it was not referred to much.  That said, it comprises a big improvement to the resources and services available to back up Members of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">The previous chairman of the commission launched a number of initiatives on raising awareness of the functions of the two Houses.  There was an outreach programme with schools and public open days.  Colleagues may have views on their efficacy.  They were a good idea although there may be adjustments to make by tweaking here and there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1728">A not insignificant decision was made to restore Leinster Lawn.  I never cease to be amazed by my friends in the Fourth Estate.  I have not seen a sidebar anywhere on the restoration of the lawn.  I read a great deal about it having become a carpark, but not a murmur about it being restored properly to its original pristine condition, as was required by the planning regulations.  If we had exempted ourselves from the restoration, we would have heard a great deal about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729">I heard a very emotive interview between Deputy Alan Shatter and Pat Kenny — I listen a lot to Pat Kenny — in which Deputy Shatter was extremely concerned over the money we spent on the restoration.  Reading between the lines, it occurred to me that the interview was really more about the election of Deputy George Lee than about the restoration of Leinster Lawn so I moved on.  That was important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1730">Deputy Bruton properly drew attention to the increased moneys put at the disposal of the Oireachtas in recent years.  He will note the big expense is associated with the committees.  The Ceann Comhairle will know that the commission recommended on an all-party basis, notwithstanding the views of anybody who demurred, the reduction of the number of committees from 24 to 15.  This was put to the Minister for Finance.  He stated in his budget speech of the previous year that he noted the commission was going to cut the number of committees.  As with the matter of Members' allowances and pay, the statutory authority is the Minister for Finance, not the commission.  The statutory authority in respect of all these matters is the Minister for Finance and, in respect of the committees, it is the Taoiseach.  Therefore, there is absolutely no point in pointing to the commission asking it to implement the cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">There is no way a House with 166 Members can support 24 committees.  It is absurd and ridiculous and the only reason for their existence is that the former Taoiseach wanted to give everybody who was not awarded a ministry of state a chairmanship and stipend to keep him happy.  He started to distribute stipends for deputy chairmen and convenors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">I do not know why my friend the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, is on my mind so much.  Some time ago I was taken aback completely when I met him running out of a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts patting his brow and perspiring furiously to welcome me and say he, as Whip of the committee, had no quorum.  "Whip of the Committee of Public Accounts" is a contradiction in terms.  An audit committee does not have a Whip.  Everybody was on a stipend for the reasons we know.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733">The Minister for Finance did not put an end to this.  Many Members on this side of the House would point to the fact that we will not make too many commitments on this matter now because we have been kicked around for 12 years.  Members on the Government side took 21 of the 24 or 25 positions.  They did so without blanching.  That was an abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734">There are committees duplicating work done by other committees.  The heavy lifting is done by the Opposition spokespersons.  If one wants to have legislation prosecuted in this House, there is no point in looking to the new white hopes on the backbenches of the other side of the House.  Most of them are strangers to legislation and will only attend if there is a high profile occasion.  Will the Minister of State inform us when the commission's decision, now one year old, to reduce the number of committees to 15 will be implemented?  Such a move would greatly help with costs of administering the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1735">Deputy Bruton asked if politics is fit for purpose.  Unfortunately, one has to say that a great many of our citizens have serious questions about it.  The position of this House <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Executive has been consistently eroded over recent years, a development which has huge implications.  This morning on the Order of Business my colleague, Deputy Emmet Stagg, raised the manner in which the guillotining of Bills has become <i>de rigueur</i> for the Government.  On any Stage of the processing of legislation, easy resort is had to the guillotine.  It becomes a question of the Government proposes and the House is expected to dispose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1736">I read the debate on the Bill in the Seanad, where coincidentally the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, was dealing with it.  On the conclusion of Second Stage, he thanked Senators for their "thoughtful, incisive and reflective contributions".  He continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1737">The Seanad provides an environment in which a more reflective debate can take place that can utilise the undoubted diverse experiences, abilities and expertise available to the Upper House in a way not readily available to the Lower House ...That is the reason the Seanad is able to make a contribution that one might not find in the Lower House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Power</from>

          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1739">The Minister of State was overawed by the quality of the contributions in the Seanad.  Like Deputy Bruton, I know the Minister of State, and all I will do is suggest to the House that he was somewhat less overawed than those quoted words would leave one to believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">If we are serious about answering if politics is fit for purpose, we must admit the way our bicameral system operates is lamentably wanting.  One cannot have a second House that replicates this one.  Neither can one have another Chamber that is roughly based on the same electoral system that elects this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1741">We have been talking about reforming the Seanad for as long as we have the draining of the River Shannon.  I do not know what will come out of the debate.  While I read the McCarthy report's recommendations, I have an open mind.  If there were a manner of reconstructing the Upper House, then it should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1742">A normal person reading the exchanges concerning the Bill's Second Stage debate would defy the Minister of State's claim he was overawed with stars in his eyes by the debate.  If one examines in detail the Official Report of the Seanad, one will find the amount of time spent on reflective, quality and insightful scrutiny of legislation line by line is modest.  There is more time spent citing lamas on the M50 and wondering what will be done about it than quality scrutiny of legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1746">I do not doubt that and it raises a question about the role of genuine local government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">The DIRT inquiry caused more lustre to be visited upon this House than anything that has happened in the past ten years.  It is remarkable we have this elaborate committee structure, yet we cannot replicate a DIRT inquiry on the largest crisis that has ever affected this economy, namely, the collapse of the banking system.  There was immediate hostility to the DIRT inquiry, first from Sir Humphrey — if time permitted I would explain my thesis on this —  and second from the Law Library.  As a result of the Abbeylara judgment, we do not know what kind of parliamentary inquiry would be feasible or debarred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1748">If we are seen not to introduce into this House a more effective note of accountability <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Executive, we will become to be seen as more impotent in tackling the problems that are now so acute affecting the people.  Deputy Bruton set out three tests comprising being able to follow the money, hold power to account and offer leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1749">Serious damage has been done to the standing of this House by the Executive's gradual arrogation of all powers over the past decade, the setting up of quangos for large areas of activity taken out of Parliament's remit and the failure to incorporate any element of parliamentary inclusion in the social partnership process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1752">The establishment of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission was one of the greatest achievements in this House since I entered it.  It gave responsibility to the Members for the administration of the business of the Houses, a development for which we should be grateful.  However, it also brought its own responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1753">I chaired the first commission and I am satisfied about defending its work.  While I share some of the concerns of Deputies Bruton and Rabbitte, they all fundamentally come down to the role of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges versus the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Many of the issues raised would be more appropriately dealt with in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1754">The Commission made every effort to seek better value for the money spent on the Oireachtas.  One example of this was the streamlining of the use of printers.  I believe the service is now more efficient and effective than it was when each party had its own printer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1755">An important point arising from the Minister of State's speech is the need to link parliamentary business with efficiencies adopted by the commission, always recognising the primacy of Parliament to regulate its business.  Sweden is an example of where this has happened.  The Minister of State also spoke about the role of the Civil Service and of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas under the 1959 Act and referred to the Minister for Finance's programme of reform, which is important in terms of this House.  The key to modernisation and maximising efficiencies is flexibility, which is required in the public service generally and is important for the running of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1756">The change to the word "service" is, in my view, a welcome first step and highlights the importance of service to people outside and the service which we receive from the commission which assists us in better looking after the needs of the people we represent.  The change to the word "service" is a positive step which reflects the drive to achieve a more Member-friendly service.  Members who have served on the commission for the past six years have done a good job in terms of helping us to do better the job we are elected to do.  Members of the House, the Clerk of the Dáil and officials who serve the commission have worked well, with everybody rowing the same way, to ensure we receive maximum benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1757">I congratulate our colleague, Deputy John Browne, on his appointment today by this House to the commission.  I wish him a successful and pleasant term of office.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Deputy Dick Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_1758">I had not intended speaking on this Bill.  I listened with great interest to the contribution made by Deputy Richard Bruton as I listened on several previous occasions to his contributions on the connection between the manner in which we do our business and govern and the job of the Executive, the public administration of the State, and both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I also listened to the contribution made by Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  I believe there is an emerging consensus that we cannot, as stated by Deputy Bruton, continue to do the business of this nation in the 21st century in Dickensian form.  I touched on this issue the other day when speaking on the legislation on public service pay.  I made the point — this point has been also made by Deputies Bruton and Rabbitte down through the years — that it is 40 years since the public service organisation review group, PSORG, report was published, at the very heart of which was the development of one particular thesis that would have dealt with the Sir Humphreys, the paucity of challenge that exists within public administration, that would have released the talent that exists within the public service and would have given this House a far more meaningful role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1759">The myth of which I am speaking is the concept of ministerial responsibility, which is absolutely daft.  If one reads what the PSORG had to say all of those years ago — taking up the point made by Deputy Bruton — it stated that the emergence of an ever growing number of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies was a way of simply avoiding the reforms needed in terms of public administration and politics.  We now have a situation that is even worse.  Again, as Deputy Bruton stated, how can we hold the Health Service Executive or any of the other quangos to account in this House?  I agree with him on the issue of regulation.  We are all the authors of our position in this matter.  We must develop a political consensus in this State.  Otherwise, we will have a public administration system which is sub-optimal, does not release the talent that exists and stultifies people with real talent.  We all know from experience that there is real talent and vigour in public administration.  However, the dead hand of this myth lies on public administration, stultifies it and prevents the evolution of our political system.  I believe we are all to blame for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1760">When one is in Government, this is a comfortable myth with which to live.  One then has the creation of more and more quangos and can say particular matters are no longer the responsibility of the Minister.  We have this bizarre idea in Ireland that this does not apply anywhere else, that in some mythical way the Minister of the day knows everything about every file and every fact.  We see this day in and day out in this House in terms of the frustration, in particular of Deputies on the opposite benches, expressed in parliamentary questions, which should not be handled in the manner in which we must handle our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1761">The myth was put in place without thinking when Queen Victoria was a little girl, and we are still applying it here in this country.  We must break away from this myth which operates as an anchor on the spirit that exists within public administration.  There were times when we actually allowed our public administration to show its capacity, namely, when people like T.K. Whitaker could produce his great paper, to which Deputy Bruton referred the other night, and could release the nation and challenge politics.  That is where we are.  I believe there is an extraordinary reality here.  The evolution of quangos in the past ten or 15 years has cost us tens of millions of euro.  I said privately the other night to Deputy Bruton that I had read his paper with great interest.  I happen to believe we are close on this issue.  Virtually every one of the quangos created did not need to be created.  We must release central administration to do the job it does best, to administer and carry out the tasks of public administration, and we must focus the Minister and ministerial advisers on policy.  We could then come into this House and challenge the Ministers of the day only on policy and not involve ourselves in who is or is not getting headage payments.  This is not just stultifying in terms of administration — this was previously known as the culture of gombeenism or, as referred to by Deputy Michael D. Higgins, clientelism — it destroys politics too because it leads us all to focus on the lowest common denominator.</p>
          <p eId="para_1762">The myth is a carbuncle on the administrative system and, more important, is a cancer within the politic system.  Irrespective of whether we like it, we are all involved in a conspiracy to sub-optimise the way we govern our country.  The sooner we recognise and change this, the better.  I do not wish to cover ground covered by other Members.  I believe the evolution of the commission was an important step forward.  I seriously believe that once some of the current passions are out of our way, we should examine how we bring or drag our administration to where John Boland wanted to bring it in 1974 but was prevented from doing so by the Sir Humphreys, the vested interests who did not want this.  I believe had we changed this we would have avoided the ballooning of our public administration system, with which we are now trying to deal, and would have been able to evolve and pay the talent what it deserves to be paid.  For example, we could have given principal officers executive responsibility for areas of public administration, thus releasing them from mythologies that now bind them.  I believe, too, that we would have changed politics.  Perhaps we have come to a point in our evolution where we have to realise those truths.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_1763">I wish to share time with Deputies Tom Hayes and David Stanton.</p>
          <p eId="para_1764">What the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, stated about the evolution of quangos was interesting.  It is a great pity that proper reform of Government and quangos was not included in the budget.  Ultimately, the party in power can determine that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1765">I will deal quickly with my experience of the House.  The Order of Business is a crazy system under which Deputies raise issues that they really should not, but it is the only mechanism available to them.  I take issue with taking Adjournment debates by candle light, almost at midnight, on issues which are often of considerable importance to the Deputies' constituents.  We need to reform the way the Dáil functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1766">I also take issue with the guillotining of debates.  In many cases, the important amendments are at the end of the amendment listing and are never debated.  That is not only about guillotining the debates, but also about the way we structure Committee Stage in terms of how we group amendments and the order in which we take them.  Certainly, there were significant areas of the NAMA legislation that were never properly subject to debate or the scrutiny of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1767">What is required here is the amendment tabled by Deputy Bruton.  It is all very well to put the audit committee on a statutory basis, but it is also about what one is auditing.  If the plan and structures are not in place as to the way money is allocated and if what one is auditing is not correctly set up on day one, then the audit function does not serve its purpose.  That is why Deputy Bruton outlined in the amendment that money would be provided for ten months.  In summary, the opportunity is here to provide for proper reform.  We need to ensure that this House represents the interests of the people properly.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_462">
          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_1768">I am very interested in the debate about how we do our business in this House.  As a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, I see at first hand the way we run and do our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1769">One matter on which I want to focus is the way we communicate our message, what we are doing and how we do it.  Regardless of whether we like it, we are elected by the people for the people.  We have a duty to those people to report back to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1770">We saw the amount of time the media devoted to a scurrilous remark and how people were interested in that.  However, that is the media's job.  As public representatives and as the Oireachtas, we need to get back into the many media, such as local newspapers and local radio stations, where people learn about what we do.  Some of the county and regional newspapers carry reports from here which would only go to some parts of the country.  This is an area that should be expanded.  It is a successful way of getting out the message of what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1771">The need for change has been addressed.  As one who is here only seven years, I am at times very frustrated about even getting a proper answer, whether through parliamentary questions or raising matters on the Adjournment, where we do not get to the core of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1772">At some time in the future we should give much more time to the type of ideas Deputy Bruton has come up with and the ideas others came up with in the past.  It is all about managing our business in a better way and communicating it to the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">It is easy to take a cheap shot at politicians and at the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for the way it does its business.  Since I have become a member of the commission, I have noted across the political divide that at all times we have endeavoured to cut back on spending where possible.  We will continue to do that because that is what we are asked to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1774">For example, when we proposed the changes to Members' expenses, how long did it take for the Department of Finance to sign off on them?  Nothing has frustrated me more in the past six months than to listen to Members asking was the change coming about.  A member of the audit committee resigned because he was not even sure who was holding it up.  In fact, the commission had already at that time made proposals, but somebody resigned, giving out the message that it was because the commission had not made up its mind on the expenses regime.  That is unfair and unjust on the commission.  The way we do our business must be changed.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_463">
          <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1775">The buzzwords at present seem to be "value for money".  The idea of changing the name to the Houses of the Oireachtas Service is a good one.  The Houses of the Oireachtas, because of the commission's existence, is taking on an identity of its own and this will be communicated to the people through the communications strategy that has been put in place.  The excellent education outreach programme, the excellent new website which has been put in place by the commission and the visitor brochures which were put in place last week are all important developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776">Given the modern communications that are available, such as youtube and twitter, anything stated in this House can be communicated across the country and across the globe within minutes.  This was brought to my attention last week when that unfortunate incident occurred which involved an utterance by a Member on the other side.  Within a short time, I received a communication from somebody in the United States asking what is happening in Dáil Éireann.  It went across the world in minutes.  That is why it is so important that we update our way of doing business in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1777">This morning, we spent almost two hours on the Order of Business, holding votes, etc.  Like my colleague, Deputy Tom Hayes, and other Deputies, I am a little frustrated about trying to reform and modernise the procedures in the House to provide value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1778">We need to improve the level of debate in the House and we need to start listening to each other.  For example, it is frustrating when Members on this side prepare Private Members' business and there is only one Minister or Minister of State on the other side listening.  Nobody else bothers to come in to listen and that is insulting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1779">I draw attention to what happened during the recent strike when Deputies had to come in and were called on by the Chair because there was no list of speakers.  Many Members were present and there was a proper interactive debate.  Members had a few minutes to speak but they listened to each other, there was interaction and there was a certain amount of dynamism evident, and that is what needs to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1780">The quangos issue has been mentioned time out of number.  I am told it will take a consolidated Bill to bring these quangos under scrutiny here so that we can ask questions.  It is frustrating to contact one of these agencies and get no response or a response stating that it will write back at some time in the future, but it never does.</p>
          <p eId="para_1781">The points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, were very interesting.  He spoke about the need to have a higher quality public administration, and I agree with him.  If I write to an official in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as I did recently on behalf of a constituent, and I get no response whatsoever, what answer would the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, give me?  As an elected Member of this House, I am ignored.  Could the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, advise me on what I do then?  When one puts down a parliamentary question to a Minister on some of these quangos that ignore us on this side of the House much of the time, the Minister concerned states that he or she is not responsible.  Who is responsible?  If this is a democracy and we are giving public money to these bodies, how can we hold them to account?  They come in to the committees once a year for a cosy chat, but the parliamentary question system is the way to go.  When Deputy O'Rourke was Minister for Public Enterprise, she ensured that the quangos under her remit answered questions to her and she made the information available here.  Ministers can do this if they wish but they choose not to do so.  That is an insult to and a danger for democracy.  I could go on and, as my colleague suggested, the debate on this matter should be extended and continue on another date.</p>

          <p eId="para_1783">Tógfaidh mise cúig nóiméad agus tógfaidh an Teachta Neville cúig nóiméad eile ina dhiaidh sin.  I will leave some of the points I intended to make until we deal with the amendments because they are related.  I am interested in the debate on how we organise the business of the House.  At some stage we must deal with the matter of the committees, including Choimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais, the Joint Administration Committee, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the sub-committee on Dáil reform and the Whips committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784">Not long ago, I recall the staff of the House sought a decision on securing works to this building.  It must have been very frustrating for them because it was about to fall down around us.  Works had not been carried out for years and that was undermining the basis of this historic building.  They had to make a presentation to four different committees to try to get agreement so that they could go ahead with the works, which were vital.  Any health and safety officer could have come in and shut this place down without recourse to any of the four committees to which the presentations were made.  That was when it struck me that some of the ways in which we run our business are ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1785">Much of the work of the commission or any of these committees is work for which one receives no thanks.  There are no votes to be had from such work.  As public representatives we must carry out such work and ensure that the business of the House is carried out in the most effective and efficient way.  That is why the commission was set up.  However, we have never addressed the overlap between various committees.  In particular, a new committee was established after the last election, namely, the Joint Administration Committee, of which I am a member.  I rarely attend but whenever I do so I try to remember which committee is supposed to be sitting, whether it is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or the Joint Administration Committee.  This is the extent of the duplication involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1786">There are other committees in the House which could be amalgamated quickly and which have the same basic purpose, including the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  These three separate committees basically deal with foreign affairs.  There are other committee groupings to which there is no logic.  The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights deals with justice and defence matters.  Another job of the commission is to ensure the effective running of the Houses and it has done so and I trust this work will continue in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1787">We need to ensure that more time is given to such legislation.  Since day one it has been rushed and the legislation ends up having to be tweaked.  Seldom do we get to a Bill which addresses the points to which the Deputies who spoke before me referred.  I will leave my contribution at that and my other points will be dealt with through the amendments I have proposed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_466">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1788">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As a member of the commission, I share the same frustrations as those expressed by Deputies Tom Hayes and Pat Rabbitte on the absence of control over certain areas.  There is an expectation that we should be able to make final decisions.  In the spring, we produced our report on the reforms which, the commission believed, unanimously, were necessary on the remuneration of Deputies and Senators.  However, we are about to enter a new year and nothing has taken place.  I share that frustration.  I have been in the Oireachtas for 20 years and in that time accountability has been diluted in our role as parliamentarians.  We have not been able to achieve the level of accountability which should be restored to the Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">I listened attentively to the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche.  He made some very good points.  Public administration should be a partner of the Oireachtas in serving our people.  However, the evolution of quangos and the removal of certain controls or the apparent removal of such controls from Ministers has almost created a conflict between public administration and the Oireachtas.  Partnership with public administration should be restored to the Oireachtas.  The quangos are interfering with the accountability of the Government to Parliament and it is also interfering with progress on the very many good views and contributions that Members make.  Any progress initiated here is being frustrated by the current system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1790">The discussion on the reform of the Dáil was both very necessary and interesting.  I envisage our role in three ways.  We should develop national policy in the interests of the people, introduce regulatory statutes to regulate certain matters and represent our constituencies.  I do not believe we are developing national policy at the appropriate level.  We are introducing some regulatory statutes and we may criticise the way in which this takes place, but we have a role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1791">The way in which we represent our constituencies is also being frustrated by the operation of the House.  Previously, this matter was referred to by speakers.  Some people cast a slur on the fact that we come from constituencies and represent issues of concern to our people.  I have no hesitation in saying I believe such work is as important as the other two areas of our work to which I referred.  Sometimes I will table a question during the Adjournment debate on an issue of importance to my constituency.  This is as important a part of our role as any other because the people who sent me here expect me to carry out such work and it is important to respond to the needs of those by whom one is employed.  Much of the work we do in the constituency area involves responding to the expressed needs of those who sent us here and I make no excuses for so doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1792">Deputy Stanton referred to this as an era of communications.  The Oireachtas has improved in this area but we must continue this improvement and continue to communicate with the people more effectively and efficiently.  As has been stated already, the means of communication has changed completely since I first entered the House and we are beginning to respond in a small way to these demands.  We have a considerable distance to go and we must continue our work effectively and efficiently with due cognisance of cost savings, but we must not ignore these matters.  At stake in the long term is the survival of democracy.  If we do not communicate what takes place here or if the people begin to turn against their elected representatives or the system something else will replace it, as we have seen in decades past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1793">I refer to the nuts and bolts of the legislation.  Rarely do I contribute on the Order of Business.  It is a pointless exercise to ask questions on the Order of Business unless one is concerned about the progress of a Bill related to an area of personal interest.  Regarding Standing Order 32, we have begun to laugh at the procedure.  Regarding the Adjournment debate, occasionally I raise issues of national concern.  However, a Minister of State comes to the House with four scripts and does not know what I intend to say or the points I intend to put.  The question is already answered by a civil servant.  It is daft.</p>

          <p eId="para_1797">This debate illustrates the need for a forum with a wider remit, rather than a formal forum.  The contributions in the House were made with passion by people who care deeply about this House and its effectiveness.  They came from both Government and Opposition sides.  I think particularly of the contribution by the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche.</p>
          <p eId="para_1798">Before answering specific questions, I will make a general point.  We do ourselves a disservice in this House.  To some degree we have a lack of self-confidence.  The country is in crisis at present and the people are looking for leadership, from the Executive and this Parliament.  If one turns on television any night of the week, the first, second and third items will be the proceedings in this House.  The citizens of this country are looking in, seeking leadership, guidance and vision.  What do they see?  Often they see grown men and women shouting at each other like babies in a crèche.  We do ourselves a disservice by acting in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1799">There are real choices to be made in the way we manage this crisis.  There is great experience and expertise on both sides of this House and we can collaborate collectively to guide our nation out of the difficulties we face.  However, the image we present to the people who elect us, our constituents, does no service to the ability, dedication and hard work of the Members of this House.  We bring ourselves into disrepute.  Often, one's contribution depends on how loud one can shout or the smartest comment a Deputy can make at any given time.  That does no service to anybody in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1800">I make those points at the outset because Deputies Richard Bruton and Pat Rabbitte, in particular, have made very constructive commentary.  Deputy Bruton asked about the substantial increase in the expenditure of the House.  Much of that related to the increase in the salaries of new staff in the House.  We have had to cut this in recent weeks but very substantial increases were made.  We spent €11 million on improving information technology in the past three years, to the benefit of all Members of the House.  We spent €14 million on severance packages for Members who lost their seats in the last election.  No doubt that sum will be down at the next election, but there was a substantial commitment in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1801">Deputy Bruton made the point that each year an agency, whether this agency or this House, comes to Government with the same budget.  The question is how we can increase the budget year on year.   The budget for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is down by €30 million from the previous occasion and the commission must operate within that framework.  I accept the general point the Deputy makes.  He also said that reform runs in the family.  I would like to think it runs in the wider family.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802">Regardless of whether we like it, the committee structures have served this House effectively in many instances.  The finest hour of this House in recent years was the DIRT inquiry.  We must engineer a situation where we can get back to fora such as that, ensure that this House is accountable to the people and show them the House really works.  Deputy Rabbitte served on that committee.  It raises the question whether, under the auspices of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the Members of this House should set up a forum or some other way by which we can express our views outside the pressure-cooker atmosphere of this House, and beyond the limited time available for this debate.  People have real contributions to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_1803">Many other contributions were made that I would like to address but I shall finish on one, namely, references made by Deputy Rabbitte to the Fourth Estate and its contribution on the proceedings of this House.  I genuinely believe the commission should respond in its own right to some of the very unjust attacks made on this House and on individual Members by members of the media.  Some recent broadcast media and radio programmes basically tried to dumb down the contributions of Members of this House.  The commission ought to and may take a more proactive role in defending the honour and integrity of Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1804">I would make other points but time does not permit me.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1813">""‘Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais' or, in the English language ‘Houses of the Oireachtas Service' means the office of".</p>
          <p eId="para_1814">This amendment is simple and in line with the spirit of the view expressed by the Minister of State.  He accepted an amendment from me in 2003 when we discussed the Act in Bill form.  If one looks at the explanatory memorandum of the 2003 Act, it states: "An Act to establish a body to be known as Coimisiún Thithe an Oireachtais or, in the English language", etc. It also states "Seirbhís Thithe an Oireachtais' or, in the English language".</p>
          <p eId="para_1815">The reason for this and the following grouped amendment No. 2 is to try to ensure that the Title is known in the Irish language rather than in English.  Far too often, our newly established quangos, State boards and bodies are no longer known by the correct title, namely, the Irish language version.  A way of overcoming this is to insert at an early stage of any Act that establishes a new body wording that gives prominence to the Irish name and then provides the English version, stating "also known as".</p>
          <p eId="para_1816">Members may recall that one of the functions of the commission was to ensure that the translation of Acts of the Oireachtas from one official language into another, generally from English into Irish.  That was one of the amendments provided in the amendment Act of 2006.  The commission has failed in that role.  When I was preparing these amendments, I found there was no Irish language translation of the very Act that gave the Coimisiún Tithe an Oireachtais the additional function to translate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1817">That is not a criticism of the translation service.  I have long had this argument with the Government.  It is difficult for somebody like me who would like to contribute to debates in the Irish language more frequently but is hampered by the non-availability of Bills in the Irish language.  Two and a half years later, the 2006 Act has still not been translated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1818">The common practice here is that the titles of positions in the House — the Ceann Comhairle and the Taoiseach — are in the Irish language.  That is the reason amendment No. 2 states that "as far as possible the Irish language titles ..." should be used.  It is not obligatory in that amendment but it is trying to ensure that one of the functions of this House, and of successive Governments, is to promote the Irish language and one way of doing that is to ensure that there is greater use of the Irish language.  In 2003 the then Minister accepted the spirit of my amendment, which changed the Long Title of that Bill.  In the same way I hope the Minister of State would accept my amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</p>

          <p eId="para_1819">While I acknowledge the intention behind amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and the Deputy's sincerity in putting them forward, there would be considerable practical difficulties in putting them into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1820">In regard to amendment No. 1, section 2 contains the definition of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service with its title in both the English and Irish language.  This presentation is consistent with normal drafting practice in terms of the alphabetical listing of definitions.  This format makes for ease of reference to legislation for all users.  This order of precedence also fits in with the common usage of the term "Houses of the Oireachtas" of which we in this House form a part.  The Irish language title, however, will receive due recognition and prominence on all letterheads, stationery, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1821">The amendment proposes to reverse the linguistic order in section 2 by putting the Irish language title before the English language title and I do not believe this change, which could have serious implications for individuals seeking access to the legislation, is the appropriate way to achieve the objective of giving greater prominence and usage to the Irish language.  In the circumstances, I do not believe we should become overly prescriptive about titles or the precedence to be given to them and, accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1822">Regarding amendment No. 2, the terms "Cathaoirleach" and "Leas-Chathaoirleach" are already in use in the Seanad.  The thinking is that this would lead to unavoidable confusion between these titles and the title of the chairman of the commission, who is the Ceann Comhairle, if they were applied routinely to officers of the commission, particularly as the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad is an <i>ex officio</i> member of the commission.  The amendment would require Irish language titles to be used as far as possible in respect of officers of the commission but the practice is that the relevant titles are most likely to be used within the context of meetings of the commission in any event and given its nature, composition and functions, it is conceivable that its deliberations need not be conducted with the level of formality which would require regular usage of such titles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1823">It is normal practice for committees and commissions to establish their own internal procedures and we should not seek to dictate or be overly prescriptive to the individuals concerned in terms of how to address each other in that particular format.  I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1824">While I understand the arguments regarding the second amendment, the argument relating to the first amendment does not take account of what I said earlier, namely, that the Long Title of the 2003 Act has the opposite formulation to what is the current common usage.  The Long Title puts the Irish language title in the primary position rather than it being an afterthought.  In doing that, the House would be telling the public that this is the first title of a body.  I have made this argument on a number of occasions but I have never got a logical answer.  I get the same response each time but, as I said earlier, the then Minister, when establishing the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, or Coimisiún Tithe an Oireachtais, accepted my arguments.  At the very least, in this Bill we should continue the logic behind accepting that in the first instance.  Once it follows the English title it does not come into common usage, for example, CIE, Coras Iompair Éireann.  Bord Soláthar Leictreachas is now known as ESB but for many years it was BSL.  An Post is another example.  There is a number of bodies set up by the State whose primary title, even if it is abbreviated with capital letters, is in Irish in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1825">In the past 20 years or so the State seems to have moved towards giving primacy to the English language title in all its new institutions or boards.  For example, NAMA is now the common word rather than NUBS, which would be the Irish abbreviation of the title.  That is one that comes to mind but there are others.  If we accept that the Irish language is the first official language according to the Constitution, even though we have altered that slightly, all bodies set up by the State should be in that primary language.  I will not pursue the issue beyond that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1828">I understand the distinction the Deputy is drawing as between the Long Title of the 2003 Act and the definitions section but while there is a difference in the ordering of the names as between both of those, the definitions section of the 2003 Act has them in the order in which they appear in this Act.  That is just a matter of presentation and being consistent with normal drafting in alphabetical order listing the definitions.  On a much more practical level, however, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, the Electricity Supply Board has come to be known in common parlance as the ESB.  This House and the Upper House are known as the Houses of the Oireachtas in common parlance.  That is not to take away from the constitutional priority attached to the Irish language or from the fact that the Irish language should be enhanced wherever possible, especially on headed notepaper, in documents emanating from the commission and so forth.  In practical terms these Houses are known as the Houses of the Oireachtas and to change that could potentially take away from the important branding of this House which formed part of the debate we heard earlier.  It is a matter of consistent drafting and the practical reality that these Houses are known as the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1833">Despite what I said earlier with regard to the duplication of committees, etc., one of the difficulties which arises is that the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both the Dáil and Seanad have a role to play with regard to oversight in terms of privileges, codes of conduct and so on in the Houses.  Members of the Houses sit on these committees.  The committees have built up expertise over many years and the amendment suggests that they, in conjunction with the Standards in Public Office Commission, should also be consulted.  This will ensure that the code of conduct will take cognisance of some of the discussions in which the Committees on Procedure and Privileges are currently involved in order that conflicts of interest will not arise and that we do not publish something which we will be obliged to overturn after a short period.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Power</from>
          <p eId="para_1834">The effect of amendment No. 3 would be to require consultation with the Committees on Procedure and Privileges of both Houses in addition to what will take place with the Standards in Public Office Commission in respect of the code of practice for members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is provided for in section 5.  The statutory requirement for consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission which is contained in the section is appropriate, particularly in light of the functions of that commission and its expertise in respect of codes of conduct.  The purpose of the code is to cover issues arising from the corporate governance functions of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  These are not matters on which the Committees on Procedure and Privileges would normally be required to deliberate and advise.  However, nothing in the section precludes the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission from consulting more widely should it see fit to do so when drawing up the code of practice.  The amendment is unnecessary and, accordingly, I am not disposed to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1835">An important function of the Committees on Procedure and Privileges is to regulate the activities of Members of the respective Houses.  At least one member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission does not fall into that category.  The role of a member of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is statutory in nature and is exercisable independently of that of public representative.  In such circumstances, a statutory requirement for consultation with the Committees on Procedure and Privileges would pose difficulties in respect of their respective roles and would possibly raise conflicts of interest for Members.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is not precluded from taking advice from the Committees on Procedure and Privileges.  Under the amendment, however, it would be obligatory for it to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_1836">I understand what the Minister of State is saying.  However, it is also not obligatory for the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission to take the advice of the Committees on Procedure and Privileges.  The amendment is designed to ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission will take the consultation process that bit further.  I take on board what the Minister of State said but given that the code of conduct is to be drafted by a body established by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the content of that code should not run contrary to any matters contemplated or discussed by the Committees on Procedure and Privileges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1837">Major discussions have taken place at meetings of the Committees on Procedure and Privileges in respect of privilege, the use of equipment located in the Houses of the Oireachtas at election time, etc.  Some of the work done by the committees at those meetings has obviously advised the thinking of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  If the boundaries relating to what the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, the Committees on Procedure and Privileges and the Joint Administration Committee are in a position to do were more clearly delineated, there would not be a need to consult various bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1838">I am happy to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that when the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission deals with this matter, someone will take on board what I have said.  All parties are represented on the Committees on Procedure and Privileges but that is not the position with regard to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Sinn Féin does not have a voice on the latter and this means that some of the points I have raised at meetings of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Dáil would not necessarily be reflected at meetings of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_1845">Unfortunately, this amendment ignores the reality that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission operates on the basis of annual Estimates, which it prepares in accordance with section 13(3) of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003.  The commission, having taken full account of the funding provision as set out in the Bill before the House, has already prepared its statement of Estimates for 2010 in any event.  This statement, in which total expenditure for 2010 is estimated at €117 million, was presented to Dáil Éireann and noted by way of motion in the House on 19 November last.  It was then furnished to the Minister for Finance in advance of his presentation to Dáil Éireann of the Estimates of receipts and expenditure for next year on budget day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1846">The Minister for Finance considers that the amendment would be unworkable in practice.  I understand the Deputy's intention in introducing it, particularly in light of the contribution he made during this debate.  However, the commission is primarily accountable to the Dáil for its expenditure in that the Secretary General can be called before the Committee of Public Accounts to give evidence on all aspects of his accounting functions as set out in section 14 of the 2003 Act.  In the context of accountability and good governance, the issue of reporting to the House is covered by the principal Act of 2003.  Accordingly, it would be impractical to accept the amendment.</p>

         the action he has taken to implement the survival actions outlined by the tourism renewal group to ensure the endurance of the tourism industry in the current economic climate; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [47909/09]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_512" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2005">The report of the tourism renewal group was launched on Thursday, 8 October 2009.  This report sets out tourism's contribution to Ireland's economic, social and cultural development and the prospects for Irish tourism in a changed world, as well as a framework for action for tourism's survival, recovery and growth over the period to 2013.  The report proposes five survival short-term actions to minimise the potential impact of current challenges and nine recovery actions for medium-term attention to set Irish tourism back on a growth path as the world economy recovers.  All of these actions are being pursued by myself, the Department and the relevant agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2006">Building on the framework for action, along with the Government's wider strategy for economic renewal, the budget recognised the tourism sector as a critical, labour intensive indigenous sector.  The overall tourism services budget will be increased in 2010.  This will enable the level and value of investment in overseas marketing of Ireland to be maintained in real terms, as recommended by the tourism renewal group.  Investment in visitor attractions will be increased to €22 million.  The Government's commitment to tourism is also shown by its inclusion in a range of cross-cutting measures, including the employment subsidy scheme, the credit review system and incentives for investment in energy-efficiency, all of which support sustainable tourism enterprises and employment.  Further specific measures that will help tourism include the changes in alcohol excise duties and VAT and the rail travel initiative aimed at senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad, although I hope to make this valid for people from the age of 55 upwards because there is a strong cohort aged between 55 and 65 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2007">I believe that drawing on the report of the group, Government and the tourism agencies are identifying and driving the right measures to assist in ensuring that tourism survives and to position the sector for recovery and growth as the Irish and global economies get back on track.</p>

          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_513">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_2008">I recognise and welcome the budgetary measure to give older persons free travel on the trains.  It may not go as far as I had hoped but it is welcome.  The travel tax, however, was not recognised.  The tourism renewal group recommended ending it as a major survival action.  It is also a major recommendation of the National Competitiveness Council in this month's report.  I do not understand how the Government missed the opportunity presented by the budget to get rid of a travel tax that every business organisation says is destroying Irish tourism.  It also makes Irish business very difficult too.</p>
            <p eId="para_2009">Yesterday, I read in the newspapers that another airline went to the wall.  I heard the Minister for Transport saying before the budget was announced that he did not believe this tax had any impact on travel but he is not talking to the airlines because he does not seem to get the point that the airlines are affected.  Hotels are not because they do not connect with decisions made in Germany or elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_2010">The airlines have not passed on this tax because their sales are very price sensitive.  Instead they are moving their bases and planes out of Ireland.  Yesterday, we heard that Ryanair has opened a base in Malaga going to 19 airports, none of them in Ireland.  This is a disaster waiting to happen. Already Aer Lingus is teetering on the brink of collapse.  Will the Minister bring the message to Cabinet that this travel tax must go before it does irreparable damage to Ireland?</p>

            <p eId="para_2013">The tourism renewal group and others involved with tourism have raised the issue of this tax and in a perfect world I would not recommend it, nor did I in the first instance.  The Government, however, has to balance that against my need for income to sustain the tourism budget and try to grow it this year.  Such taxes are not helpful but that must be placed against the fact that tourism was the only sector in the budgetary system that increased this year.  That was greatly welcomed.  The Deputy is aware of the positive responses to the budget from organisations such as the Irish Hotels Federation.  I am worried when I see the remarkable recovery of the American market, which was down only 2.2% at the end of September when Aer Lingus was down almost 26%.  That is not in harmony with the general market figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">I met with Continental and Delta airlines, US Airways and Aer Lingus early in the year when the figures were disastrous in the American market for the first quarter.  We began giant marketing programmes and specific programmes with the airlines which worked extremely well.  There must be a message for Aer Lingus in this if the market is down only 2% and Aer Lingus is down 25% or 26%.  This is extremely worrying because Aer Lingus is an important part of the brand and marketing of Ireland and will have an important role.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_2015">While I appreciate all that is being done to improve the American market, does the Minister accept that the travel tax does not impact as much on the American market as it does on the short haul flights to Europe?  A tax of €10 on a flight that costs only €5 has a much bigger impact than on a flight costing €200.  The travel tax impacts on the short-haul and European flights, the flights for a weekend.  This is not to deny the importance of the American market.</p>

            <p eId="para_2018">I accept that.  I am not disagreeing with the Deputy but these extra charges which are passed on, as well as those for booking on the Internet and the differences about arriving at the airport are way beyond the €10 travel tax.  Airlines seem to be able to do that at will without difficulty and pass those charges onto their customers at the same time, yet the travel tax is made out to be a bigger issue, which I question.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2020">Funding for my Department for 2010 is €501 million, a decrease of 7% on the 2009 figure.  The tourism services budget for 2010 is over €155 million, representing an increase of 2% on 2009.  The enhanced allocation for tourism for 2010 is clear recognition by Government of the important role that the tourism and hospitality sector will play in Ireland's economic recovery.  A total of €22 million has been allocated for capital investment in tourism product development, a threefold increase over the 2009 level.  This investment will be focussed on completing the upgrading of some major tourism attractions, developing a select number of new visitor attractions, improving infrastructure for recreational cycling, walking and water-based activities and local heritage attractions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2021">The 2010 allocation for the Tourism Marketing Fund is over €44 million.  This will enable the level and value of investment in overseas marketing of Ireland to be maintained in real terms in 2010 as recommended in the report of the tourism renewal group.  Funding to arts, culture and film for 2010 is €166 million.  Within this, I am pleased to have secured over €69 million for the Arts Council which will continue to sustain the country's main arts organisations, keep regional arts and theatre venues open and support local festivals and touring initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">Funding for the Irish Film Board is €19 million.  The section 481 tax relief scheme for investment in film and TV production is maintained until at least 2012, underpinning the Government's commitment to the importance of our indigenous Irish film and audiovisual sector.  Culture Ireland's allocation for 2010 is over €4 million. Culture Ireland and Tourism Ireland have intensified joint planning on cross-promotions in the cultural tourism field.  Capital funding for arts infrastructure has been consolidated in my Department and all major arts capital projects will be completed as will regional capital projects to which commitments have been made.  Day-to-day funding for the national cultural institutions is maintained at or above 2007 levels and their capital funding is maintained at 2009 levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">The Deputy will be aware that, at the Global Irish Economic Forum held in Farmleigh in September, there was wide acknowledgement of the importance of culture in promoting Ireland abroad and developing a unique brand for the country in new markets.  Internationally, the creative economy is moving centre stage and creativity is seen as a crucial bedrock, underpinning our knowledge economy.  I am pleased that these significant levels of funding have been secured to support the arts next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_2025">A total of €48 million has been provided for the sports capital programme in 2010.  This will ensure that commitments arising in 2010 from previous allocations under the sports capital programme will continue to be met.  With regard to the local authority swimming pools programme, the allocation of €7.5 million in 2010 will be sufficient to meet commitments arising in 2010 under the current round of the programme.  Funding of €49.8 million has been provided to the Irish Sports Council for 2010 and is a significant investment by Government to enable this important agency maintain existing programmes and build on recent significant progress in all areas, including local sports partnerships, Buntús, women in sport, older people and sport, youth field sports and the high performance programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2026">Due to the economic constraints, it is not possible to move forward with the main phase 1 of the national sports campus project at this time.  In the meantime, however, €3 million capital has been provided in my Department's 2010 provision for the refurbishment of the former Marine Institute building at Abbotstown which will be used as a headquarters for national governing bodies of sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2027">An estimated 27,000 jobs are supported by both the horse and greyhound industry in Ireland and significant inward investment is attracted to the country.  Taking account of the need to continue to support both industries, €59.3 million is being allocated by Government to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2028">I believe that the importance of the arts, sport and tourism sectors to the country are reflected in the commitments contained in the renewed programme for Government and in the funding secured under the budget for my Department's activities over the course of 2010.  I look forward to a number of exciting developments next year, including the completion of two major projects — the national conference centre and the Aviva Stadium at Lansdowne Road — and the continuation of significant pieces of work which are ongoing at present regarding the new National Concert Hall project, the assessment of the GPO complex as a possible location for the Abbey Theatre and the creation of a new national opera company.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_2029">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I have talked to people in the arts, sport and tourism sectors who feel that the wool has been pulled over their eyes.   They were expecting such bad news.  This is true of the budget in general, and it is the feedback on it.  When they hear, for example, that the Arts Council is only to have a 13% cut for the entire year, they believe this is not so bad.  I do not agree with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_2030">How much will the Kennedy homestead memorial project cost, for example, and when is construction expected to begin?  Is it a matter for the OPW or the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism?  Where will the funding come from to man these capital projects because while the tourism percentage is up by 2%, virtually everything else is decreased in this regard apart from the capital budget.  That means many more buildings will appear, including the Kennedy homestead development, so where is the current funding to come from to support those projects?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_523" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2031">The Kennedy project the Deputy refers to is an OPW proposal.  It was announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget and the OPW is part of the Department of Finance.  The resources are secured and will not be coming out of the budgets here.  As the Deputy can see, we have an substantial number of projects in place that we want to complete.  We shall seek to secure new projects, not all of them necessarily requiring current funding from our perspective.  Many of them are well able to provide their own funding, as, for example, different projects in the tourism sector.  It is correct that some are State operated, but some are managed by local authorities in many different areas around the country.  I accept these are challenging times in terms of current funding for anything, regardless of whether it is national or local government.</p>
            <p eId="para_2032">After years of growth and enormous capital provision around the country, I did not want some of these facilities closing down, so I decided that no matter how difficult it would be, we must try to sustain these centres and keep them open, at a minimum, while maintaining as much employment as possible within them.  I am sure the level of activity is not as high as they would like and I accept that if they had more money, they would do more.  However, the alternative would not be acceptable.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_524">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_2033">I have a few comments in regard to sports as well, although I have a final comment to make in respect of arts.  Multi-annual funding is one of the features of great importance, particularly for the Arts Council, in terms of being able to engage people, for example, for opera singing and so on.  The council has to engage people, perhaps two years in advance, and it cannot do this without multi-annual funding.  There is no word about this anywhere in the budget and it is something about which the council would like to have heard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">There is no national sports campus and no new local authority swimming pool.  All of this has closed since 2000, so overall the Minister's comments would be appreciated in terms of what is happening with sport because, again, the budget is significantly down in terms of 2008 funding.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_525" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2035">As the Deputy is aware, the response from the Irish Sports Council and many of the NGBs around the country has been extremely positive, in the context of the budget, with the money that has been allocated——</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_526">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_527" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2037">——which, of course, has been substantially increased in recent years.  Most of the sports council's facilities will remain in place, and this is most important.  We have completed an significant amount of capital investments throughout the country in recent years, as the Deputy has indicated.  She mentioned the swimming pool programme and five are still under completion out of the 45 we built around the country.  It is not as if all development has stopped.  The Deputy is right, and I would love to have an ACCESS programme opening again for the arts, and ACCESS 2 for the swimming pool programme, but, again, that is not available to me this year.  Choices had to be made and, as I have made clear to the Deputy, whether it is arts, sport or tourism, I wanted to sustain employment as much as possible and market all these facilities as best I can, with good budgets.  That is what is being done at home and abroad and as things recover.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">If I was to accept multi-annual funding based on current circumstances, it would only be going one way, downhill.  We all hope, given the quality of the budget as presented, that we get to mid-year when Ireland will begin to see the benefits of an upturn.  If that happens, we should be in a stronger position to look at the funding available in the years ahead.</p>

        <b>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
         his views on the report by Dr. Peter Bacon on the unsustainability of many hotels here; his views on the implications of this report for future tourism infrastructure; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [47910/09] 
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_528" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2040">I have noted the report, Overcapacity in the Irish Hotel Industry and Required Elements of a Recovery Programme, by Peter Bacon &amp; Associates, which was published very recently.  Its main conclusion is that between 12,300 and 15,300 hotel rooms need to be removed from the market if an appropriate balance is to be achieved that would allow the sector to recover to a stage where it can provide adequate returns and regain overall solvency.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">I note the report's analysis that the overcapacity in the system at present has been caused by additional hotel development and investment in recent years and reduced demand and that in order to restore the financial health of the sector, there will in all likelihood be less rooms in future years.  Many of the recommendations in what is a complex and wide-ranging report are for the industry itself to address, while others relate to the availability of credit, local authority rates and amendments to the accelerated capital allowances scheme.  These issues are matters for consideration primarily by my colleagues, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2042">With regard to my response to the report, I continue to support the development of Irish tourism and, through the international and domestic marketing effort of the tourism State agencies, seek to increase visitor numbers for hotels and others accommodation providers.  My input to the 2010 budget has ensured that it incorporates a range of measures and initiatives to renew Irish tourism.  These include the maintenance in real terms of the funding for the tourism marketing fund, an increase in overall funding levels for tourism services and a trebling of the funds available for tourism product development.  In addition, a new rail travel initiative aimed at senior citizens from abroad and a reduction in excise duty on alcohol products and VAT will assist the sector in addressing the cost of holidaying here.  Key elements of the budget build on actions recommended in the report of the tourism renewal group to which I referred in my earlier response.</p>
            <p eId="para_2043">In commenting on the budget, the Irish Hotels Federation welcomed the decisive measures to restore the public finances and the acknowledgement by Government of the important role of tourism in the economy and specifically welcomed the measures that I have just outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">There is no doubt that the tourism industry as a whole had a very difficult year in 2009 and many challenges remain in the coming years.  That said, there is, I believe, real potential for the industry to return to growth in 2010.  The increased allocation of public resources provided in the budget — at a time of major financial retrenchment — is clear recognition by the Government of the important role that the tourism and hospitality sector will play in Ireland's economic recovery.  I will continue to work closely and meet with the hotel industry to ensure that it plays its full part in that recovery.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_529">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_2045">No matter what the Minister does, he will never fill all the hotel beds that have been built over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">On the Bacon report, which was the subject of my question, its conclusion was — I find this hard to accept — that we gave tax breaks to developers to open hotels and now we are to give them tax breaks to close them.  Nevertheless, this raises a big issue and I have written to the Competition Authority in this regard, since I believe it completely distorts competition and gives rise to all types of issues regarding, I suspect, reckless trading and predatory pricing.  Many of the tax incentivised hotels, as the Minister knows, were never viable from the day they opened.  I am getting reports almost every day from people who genuinely know what is going on that, nonetheless, the banks are pouring working capital into these hotels.  On the other hand, those hotels that are viable, with substantial debt, cannot get working capital.  This is a very real issue and I raise it only to ascertain whether there is anything the Minister can do.  Simply talking to the hotels and sending marketing people to the USA is not going to cut it.  We are going to have to do something because the existing infrastructure will be closed down if we wait for NAMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">The real danger is that, when NAMA takes over these loans, it will do the same thing because there is nothing in its business plan to suggest it will go after non-performing loans.  What can the Minister do?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_530" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2048">In the first instance, I am very much aware of the issue, as is the Government and the Minister for Finance.  There is an issue here for NAMA because undoubtedly there is distortion.  Some properties are clearly not viable, without mentioning any specifically, but we all know where they are.  They are distorting the market and are simply being kept open to turn some money over, which is having a negative impact on the competitive pricing that good hotels have been able to produce.  If we look for a silver lining, one of the effects of recession is that the cost base is reducing in Ireland.  That had to happen, since there is no question but that we had priced ourselves out of the market.  Clearly, what is happening now is driving down costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2049">However, there is a difference between hotels where costs are being driven down to what are still commercial prices, albeit not at the same profit levels as before, and those that are clearly not viable.  We must deal with that issue.  There are four areas of concern: demand, costs, access to credit and over-capacity.  We can deal with demand because that is our job through the tourism agencies.  The Deputy will be aware that 900 German travel agents visited Ireland, which was a major success.  For the first time, we are advertising on German television this year, so even with less money we are expanding what we can do.  There is huge value to be obtained and that is just one example.</p>
            <p eId="para_2050">We are already seeing the benefit of lower costs across the spectrum, which are being received positively in other markets.  Access to credit is an issue concerning working capital with the banking system as we go through the winter.  I also accept that over-capacity is an issue.  We are working to resolve these matters.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_531">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_2051">Even in the best of days there was not enough business to fill those hotels, so the Minister is not going to do it now in the middle of a world recession.  We must do something, however, to save the hotels that are still there.  A lot of personal and State money has been invested in that infrastructure around the country.  If we wait for NAMA to sort it out, half the hotels will have closed down.  It is not just a personal issue for hotel owners, but also a national issue in terms of tourism.  There is no point in trying to market Ireland abroad if we find that half the hotels are closing down here, or just opening some bedrooms.  It is doing damage to the infrastructure network we built up around the country.  What is the Minister going to do?  He tells me he will create demand, but that will not do it.  These are non-commercial practices and we must deal with them.</p>

            <p eId="para_2057">I am telling the Deputy what was their primary message.  We have dealt with that because it is within my capacity to try to increase demand.  I agree with the Deputy that we have an over-capacity and I quoted the Bacon report in that respect.  I am not arguing about whether the figures are a bit high or low, but there is an over-capacity issue.  There is no doubt that some of the hotels that are currently being supported by the banking system are not viable.  They are only doing so to turn money and I have put that on the record.  I have spoken to the Minister for Finance about this and the Government is aware of it.</p>

         his views on the future viability of the restaurant sector; the discussions he has had regarding the competitiveness issues affecting the industry in view of the importance of gastronomy to the tourism industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_544" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2065">The restaurant sector, like all businesses in tourism and hospitality, has had a very challenging year in 2009.  Prior to the budget, the Restaurants Association of Ireland launched a ten-point plan to protect employment, create new jobs and ensure the viability of the sector.  In September last, I met the president and the chief executive of the association and discussed key issues of concern to them, including competitiveness issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">The budget has responded to a number of the issues raised by the association as follows: the reduction in excise duties on alcohol and VAT; the introduction of an enhanced scheme of accelerated capital allowances for energy efficient equipment to include catering and hospitality equipment; an increase in the tourism services budget of 2% to over €155 million in 2010, including maintaining the level and value of investment in tourism marketing in real terms; and a rail travel initiative aimed at senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">In addition, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently extended eligibility of the employment subsidy scheme to include the tourism and hospitality sector.  She has also established a credit review system for all SME sectors, including tourism, and has extended the work placement scheme to include small businesses.  Furthermore, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has also commenced the process of examining the burden of local authority charges on business through the establishment of a local government efficiency review group to review the cost base, expenditure of and numbers employed in local authorities.  This group is due to report by the middle of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">Aside from the budget and related initiatives, Fáilte Ireland is working closely with businesses to help them survive the recession and emerge prepared to take advantage of the anticipated upturn in the medium term.  Specifically, Fáilte Ireland is providing a range of business support services, including a business mentoring and coaching service, and a business advisory service, as well as the Optimus programme and Performance Plus, which are on-line business tools.  In the restaurant sector specific supports being provided by Fáilte Ireland include a chefs' workshop programme to cut costs and increase profitability; a front of house productivity programme; a quality food toolkit CD resource; a workshop on financial management for restaurants addressing topical issues, including cash-flow, negotiating with key suppliers, re-negotiating key contracts, including leases and dealing with banks and investors in accessing credit and investment cash; and the production of an employment law compliance case studies and guide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">Fáilte Ireland is also leading and working with Government Departments, agency partners and industry stakeholders, including the Restaurants Association of Ireland to position Ireland as one of the world's outstanding authentic food tourism destinations and to position Irish food experiences at the core of Ireland's tourism brand.  Fáilte Ireland plans to engage with the RAI early in the new year to discuss a number of actions and interventions for 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_2070">I thank the Minister for his reply.  I do not need to remind him what an important part of the tourism industry the restaurant sector is.  It supports approximately 64,000 jobs. According to the restaurateurs themselves, at least one in three of them is in danger of closing within the next few months.  That will not come as a surprise because in every town and city, including Dublin, restaurants are closing down regularly.  Their main problem is that costs are too high.  One of the issues they have raised is that of higher payments for Sunday working.  I understand that there have been some improvements from double time down to time and a third, but the whole structure of the catering industry pay rates seems to be a real barrier to survival for many such firms.  Has the Minister made representations to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this regard?  Are there any proposals to try to bring such costs down to a more realistic level in the current situation, so that they would at least compare favourably to what other similar countries are charging?  I am not asking the Minister to compare the situation with poorer countries, but with what similar countries are paying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2071">The other complaint concerns fat traps.  Can the Minister make representations to local authorities about that?  These are traps that must be installed by law to catch grease in restaurants.  It is expensive to install them but it can cost almost €1,000 to have them monitored by a private company, even though the environmental health officers come out for other purposes.  This adds to the cost of running a restaurant, along with waste licences.  Another money spinner for local authorities are the outdoor seating areas.  That was fine in the good times, but they are putting businesses out of work now.  Is there anything the Minister can do, such as talking to local authorities about the importance of this for the economy?  We must all put our shoulders to the wheel now.</p>

            <p eId="para_2072">In fairness, I have outlined a substantial range of actions that are being undertaken.  I know they are appreciated.  We are a lot of the costs for for the sector also.  In addition, we will carry much of the cost to allow them to promote abroad, including attending some trade shows.  I acknowledge the direct role played by the Tánaiste on Sunday trading, after much discussion with myself.  There is no doubt that it was a major issue and a major move forward has been made.  I agree with the Deputy that it is not sustainable that Sunday trading would incur an extra cost.  We have all moved to a seven-day week, so we will have to renegotiate this across the entire workforce to remain competitive.  It will have to come to the next step, and I hope that by negotiation in the near future it will be seen as a normal rotation of whatever constitutes a 40-hour week.  That is the way it has to be.</p>

I have spoken to my colleagues in Cabinet to try to keep the issue moving, particularly now that we find ourselves very challenged.  I am not surprised that many businesses, including restaurants, are extremely challenged.  This is not just because of what has happened here, but because of the situation with regard to the global economy.  We must do everything we can to try to keep those restaurants open.</p>

         the implications of budget 2010 on the capital and current spending programmes in sport; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_549" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2077">We all appreciate the important role that sport plays in our society in promoting healthy lifestyles, creating a sense of identity and belonging and in channelling energy in rewarding activity and bringing people together.  I assure the Deputy the Government is committed to sport and believes in the contribution it can make to our society, for individuals and for communities.  Thus the importance of the sport sector to the country is reflected in the commitments contained in the renewed programme for Government and the funding secured for the sector under budget 2010.  I am committed to increasing and developing participation and interest in sport, improving standards of performance and to developing sports facilities, thereby contributing to healthier lifestyles and an improved overall quality of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_2078">A total of €48 million has been provided for the sports capital<b> </b>programme in 2010.  This provision for sports capital projects will ensure that commitments arising in 2010 from previous allocations under the sports capital programme will continue to be met and that a range of modern facilities will be brought in to use in 2010.  Since 1998, in excess of €725 million has been allocated to 7,400 sports projects all over the country.  A sum of €49.8 million has been provided to the Irish Sports Council for 2010.  This is a significant investment by Government to enable this important agency to maintain existing programmes and build on recent significant progress in all areas, including local sports partnerships, Buntús, women in sport, older people and sport, youth field sports and the high performance programme.  The Lansdowne Road stadium, a key sports infrastructure project, remains on schedule to be completed on time and within budget in 2010.  The allocation by the Department of €4.5 million in 2010 represents the retention amount of the Government’s funding for the project of €191 million.  With regard to the local authority swimming pools programme, the allocation of €7.5 million is being provided to meet commitments arising in 2010 under the current round of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">Ireland is the third largest breeder of thoroughbreds in the world and Irish horses and jockeys consistently succeed at the highest level.  An estimated 27,000 jobs are supported by both the horse and greyhound industry in Ireland and significant inward investment is attracted to the country.  Taking account of the need to continue to support both industries, €59.3 million is being allocated by Government to the horse and greyhound racing fund in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">I would like to offer my congratulations to John Ox and Sea the Stars.  I wish Michael Kinnane, who had a fantastic year at 50 years of age, every success in his retirement.  It is being said that Sea the Stars was the best horse of the past 300 years.  I am delighted that horse is going to stand stud in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2081">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">In view of the current economic constraints, the first phase of the national sports campus project will not be proceeding at this time.  However, a sum of €3 million is being provided for the refurbishment of the former Marine Institute building at Abbotstown, which will be used as a headquarters for national governing bodies of sport.  The remainder of the allocation will be used to provide for capital maintenance at the National Aquatic Centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">I am satisfied that the budgets provided for the various sports programmes in a very difficult budgetary environment will enable us to continue with the pursuit of our strategic objectives in the sport area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2084">I wish to join in the congratulations of the Minister to John Ox and Michael Kinnane.  It must be said that the McCarthy report has made a hero of the Minister in the sense that it suggested cuts of 34%.  I do not want to be mealy-mouthed but I would like to give the Minister credit for not going along that line and for keeping the cut to 4%.  However, that is where my praise finishes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2086">It may be.  The Minister has just got his present.  In his response the Minister stated that more sports means a healthier and happier nation and more jobs.  However, we should not forget that the €48 million allocated to the sports capital programme is a reduction of 14% on the 2009 allocation.  We are almost at the end of 2009.  Has the €56 million that was allocated for 2009 been spent or will it all be spent?  Rather than saying he would like to open up applications, will the Minister assure the House that he is committed, if still in Government, to opening up sports capital grants again in 2011?</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2091">I thank Deputy O'Mahony for his kind comments.  We had difficult choices to make when considering the economic situation, but we managed quite well.  I am pleased by that.  We did not manage badly for the right reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">There is an overhang still, of approximately €120 million, on the sports capital programme.  We estimate that what we will need in 2010 is €48 million to complete the required part of the programme.  The €56 million allocation for this year was all spent by October, so there was no issue in that regard.  I would like to have another sports capital programme.  We are doing an assessment of what we have done over the past ten years.  A significant sum of €750 million has been put into capacity around the country.  There is some unevenness in the regions with regard to what has been provided and I am trying to assess that so as to establish what is required in any new programme.  Therefore, if there is a new programme it will not, as with any new programme, be on the same basis.  However, it should be a sports capital programme and I am committed to that. It may need to be more specifically targeted than in the past.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_557">
            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_2093">The problem is the sums of €56 million and €48 million represent the same as the €80 million pledged in 2006 and 2007.  The Minister took the credit for that amount at that time.  I am glad the Minister has given some assurance for 2011, but what is to happen with the swimming pool programme?  The Minister mentioned €7.5 million.  That figure is 40% down on the amount provided in 2009.  Therefore, the overall 4% cut mentioned earlier covers up a lot of figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">The grants to support sport in disadvantaged areas have suffered a cut of 70% in the current spending budget.  Under the sports partnerships, there are 20 sports inclusion disability officers.  These were paid from the dormant accounts with €60,000 provided for the work of each of them.  I know at first hand of the serious work done by these officers and the opportunity this programme has provided to the disabled.  Disabled people were affected by the budget last week.  Can the Minister guarantee this funding will be protected and expanded in the coming year?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_558" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2095">That is an important question and the Deputy is correct.  Some €2.5 million came from the dormant accounts fund, from the Department of my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I have spoken to the Sports Council about this issue and it will maintain the funding for the disability officers.  We believe in them.  It is difficult and challenging for us to maintain the programme, but we see the disability officers as an intricate part of the programme who make an important contribution in particular areas of sport.  The issue is being examined currently and I am very cognisant of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">The reason for the cut in funding for the swimming pool programme is that we have built 45 swimming pools.  Therefore, the capital programme has been reducing.  The amount provided for this year is all we need this year.  I can only spend a €7.5 million this year because the programme is at the end of its life and there is no requirement for more money in 2010.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2099">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 17  together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">Special funding of €2.5 million was allocated from the dormant accounts fund for the appointment of 20 sports inclusion development officers, SIDOs, in local sports partnerships, LSPs, in 2008.  The SIDOs were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.  A network of 33 LSPs have been set up throughout the country by the Irish Sports Council, ISC, to co-ordinate and promote sport at local level, particularly among specific target groups, such as older people, girls and women, people with disabilities, unemployed people and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.  The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the LSPs by the ISC for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.  The ISC has allocated €6 million to the LSPs in 2009.  I have received representations on funding under this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2101">The continued funding of the sports inclusion disability officer scheme is a matter for the Irish Sports Council in the context of the distribution of its budget for 2010, supplemented by a provision of €395,000 in the Vote of the Department, and the council's priorities within its ongoing funding of the local sports partnership network.  The priority is to build on the significant progress by the council in achieving its statutory objectives of increasing participation in recreational sport and improving high performance levels.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_560">
            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_2102">I am not sure what that response was telling me.  As the Minister knows, the sports inclusion disability officers work through the local sports partnerships.  The dormant account funding from last year amounted to €1.3 million while it is €300,000 this year.  Clearly, there is significant shortfall of €1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">Approximately 5,000 people were able to participate in sport for the first time through the partnerships on foot of the work of the sports inclusion disability officers.  The latter were doing outstanding work.  People who were very isolated were afforded an opportunity to participate in sport.  From health and social perspectives, such people probably benefit more from participation in sport than the able-bodied.  It was wonderful to be able to expose them to sport for the first time.  To withdraw the programme would be a real tragedy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">Will the €1 million be made up by the Irish Sports Council or the Department?  Will it be made up in full?</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_561" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2105">The Irish Sports Council has an allocation and must make choices.  I happen to agree with the Deputy and have made my views clear to the council that the programme needs to be continued.  I cannot speak for the council but I understand it is minded in that direction.  It must consider the total budget and determine where savings can be made in other areas so the resources can be allocated.</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">The work of the local sports partnerships is outstanding.  I fought for the budget and kept it largely in place to maintain in the coming years the programmes on the ground, bearing in mind the employment created and the services offered to those in all the relevant sectors, including the disadvantaged, women's groups and the disabled.  I am reasonably confident that will be the outcome in 2010.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_562">
            <from>Deputy Mary Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_2107">The problem is that the magic fund of the Irish Sports Council is getting smaller by the minute.  In 2008, it had €57 million and now its allocation is €49 million, representing a decrease of 13%.  Out of its allocation, it must fund all the sports, including those under the remit of the sports inclusion disability officers.  How far can the fund stretch without seriously damaging the work of the officers?  Everybody agrees they have had a great impact and have been very inclusive.  They have given people who might never have been able to participate in sport the opportunity to do so, not to mention the fact they have created employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2108">While it is all very fine to say the Irish Sports Council has responsibility and that it is up to it to decide how to distribute its funds, it will not have sufficient funding.  Somebody will have to suffer seriously.  There is approximately €400,000 secured for the sports inclusion disability officer programme.  A grant can be applied for, to a maximum of €25,000, which sum must be dedicated to salaries.  I do not know where the money is coming from.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2109">We are now in different times but one advantage of this is that we are achieving far better value for the money we are spending.  We can almost realise the same value as we did some years ago, although the budgets have decreased somewhat in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">We want to maintain as much activity as we can.  I have gone about this in the correct way.  There were choices to be made on some of the programmes the Deputies raised, which I cannot fund at present as much as I would like to do so.  My sole objective is to ensure that there are as many people as possible participating in sport at all levels.  I believe the inclusion programme about which the Deputies spoke will be in place in 2010.</p>

One would not have to be a rocket scientist to realise the programme will be cut back drastically if funding does not come from somewhere else.

The money was coming from a different Department altogether, granted that I am facing the pass regarding what has arisen.  With regard to my funding and programmes, nothing has been done to undermine the programme in question.  I am trying, in spite of resourcing difficulties, to sustain the programme.  I will be tracking it.  I am sure Deputy Mitchell will have a question tabled in the coming months on how exactly it is working.  The money was very well spent and the programme has had a great impact.  Without the programme, the quality of life of the participants would be much lower.</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_575" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2124">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 10 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries is provided under the horse and greyhound racing fund, which was established under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.  Section 12(6) of the Act specifies that, of the moneys paid into the fund each year, 80% shall be paid to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% shall be paid to Bord na gCon.</p>
            <p eId="para_2126">In 2004, and earlier in 2009, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the fund.  By the end of 2009, a total of €613.9 million will have been paid out of the fund.  In 2008, €76.3 million was allocated to the fund.  Of this, €36.4 million was derived from excise duty on off-course betting, with €39.9 million provided by the Exchequer.  In 2009, of the €68.1 million allocated to the fund, €36.6 million was derived from betting duty, with €31.5 million provided directly by the Exchequer.  Some €59.3 million has been allocated to the horse and greyhound racing fund for 2010.  There are no projections available for excise duty on off-course betting for that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2127">Funding of both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon supports two very important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding and training enterprises in the development of the rural economy.  These industries, together, account for an estimated 27,500 direct jobs, generate very substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy, including farm incomes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2128">The funding given to the greyhound racing sector helps in sustaining a tradition that has existed for hundreds of years and in underpinning the economic activity in what are, in many instances, less affluent regions of the country.  The funding has also contributed significantly to the almost €90 million that has been invested in the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.  The funding has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  The funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horse racing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2129">The Deputy will be aware that a review of the horse and greyhound racing fund has been completed this year.  In that context, a report on the horse and greyhound racing fund by FGS Consulting has been produced.</p>
            <p eId="para_2130">The report states that, while not all aspects of the total contribution of the sector can be definitively quantified, adequate direct and indirect evidence supports a strong argument that the horse and greyhound racing industries constitute a major source of direct and indirect employment, give rise to considerable domestic and export earnings and are a key driver of substantial economic activity, especially in rural areas.  On this basis, the report argues there is a strong underpinning for the original objectives of the fund in providing Exchequer support to promote and enhance these indigenous industries based on their potential to yield a substantial economic return.</p>
            <p eId="para_2131">The report maintains any sharp withdrawal or curtailment of funding in the short term would likely have major detrimental impacts on the industries involved, with the consequent risk of undoing much of what has been achieved since the fund came into existence in 2001.  At least in the medium term, these industries need secure State support.  If this were not available, employment would fall, infrastructural development would not take place, the product would deteriorate, integrity would become compromised and the industries would be seriously undermined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2132">Some €59.3 million has been allocated to the fund for 2010.  This substantial funding will build on the almost €614 million already invested in the industries since 2001.  I intend to work closely with Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon to ensure that these important industries continue to contribute to the economy.  To give effect to this Estimates allocation, it is necessary under the relevant provisions of the Horse and Greyhound Act 2001 to have the increase in the horse and greyhound fund specified by regulation.  The process commenced earlier this week with the laying of the draft regulations before the Houses.  The appropriate offices of the Dáil and Seanad have been contacted to request the resolution be placed on their respective Order Papers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2133">I hope to appear before the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in January with a view to making the regulations shortly thereafter so that the 2010 funding to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon can be paid out.</p>

            <from>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</from>
            <p eId="para_2134">No Member will disagree this valuable industry must be supported.  It provides not just 28,000 jobs but the unquantifiable benefit that it internationally showcases Ireland.  I am concerned, however, as are those involved in the industry, as to how it will be funded.  Many times the Minister has claimed he is examining new ways of funding.  I note in his Department's submission on the cuts proposed by an bord snip nua that great savings would be made in the new scheme for the horse and greyhound fund.  How are these savings to be effected?  What new taxation scheme will be introduced?  Has any progress been made in devising a new scheme to capture Internet betting.  Will new legislation be introduced for a new horse and greyhound fund?</p>

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_577" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2135">I will be presenting my proposals on that in January to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2136">There are several elephants in the room that were not mentioned at all, one of which is betting tax.  The Minister indicated there is no figure potentially available for the coming year for betting tax.  The Irish Bookmakers Association predicts it could be €30 million, leaving a shortfall of €30 million from direct Exchequer funding.  This shortfall will be made up from funding for other sporting organisations and the Department's general Vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_2137">All Members are supportive of the horse and greyhound racing industries and recognise they are hugely important to the economy, particularly in rural areas.  The point is where the funding for the industry comes from and how it is put in place to ensure the industry can be sustained without taking it from direct Exchequer funding, as was intended originally until the change in the 2001 to the rules.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Cullen</from>
            <p eId="para_2138">I had to fight very hard to get the amount for this fund.  Everyone accepts the Exchequer cannot continue to put the resources that it has already.  We all accept it is not just a sport, but a hugely important and significant industry.  The Minister for Finance is directly involved in examining the taxation issues surrounding the industry, which I welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2139">I am deeply frustrated with the general across-the-board support from the industry.  I have spoken to all the players and everyone blames everybody else.  That is no longer going to cut any ice.  We are seeing an industry that has boomed over the past several years with large amounts of money being bet on telephone and the Internet outside of the country.  I believe that so much resources are being spent on the industry that a small percentage from it would more than adequately assist the horse and greyhound fund.  I hope this will be resolved because the Exchequer will not continue to add to the fund in the future.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_587">
            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_2149">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to raise this important matter which impacts on the health of the entire midlands region and in particular, Longford-Westmeath.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">Due to extreme public disquiet in the midlands, will the Minister for Health and Children give me a guarantee that services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Mullingar, County Westmeath, will be maintained, as further erosion of essential medical facilities following on the recent off-call status of the accident and emergency department at the hospital, would be untenable?  There is a real fear that the Longford-Westmeath hospital is being closed by stealth.  While I am not used to getting honest answers on the long-term plans of the HSE, I must stress a deliberate and cold-hearted campaign of axing services to the detriment of the health of the people of the midlands will not be tolerated and questions must be answered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">We have heard of Nero fiddling while Rome burned.  What we are seeing is a health system attempting to make good the fiddling of the books while patients die.  While it may not be politically correct to raise such a sensitive matter, people are dying who would be alive and with their families if they had the benefit of a competent and well-run Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">Given the ongoing destruction of the health infrastructure in Longford-Westmeath and the lack of backup care given to the ill, the terminally ill, the elderly patients and those requiring emergency treatment, the people of the region are not prepared to see a further erosion of health provision.  They have been totally abandoned by the Government, in particular the Government Deputies Mary O'Rourke and Peter Kelly who are supposed to represent their interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">The Longford-Westmeath hospital is struggling to maintain its services.  Unless the 41 acute beds that the HSE has axed are re-opened, this hospital will be the latest casualty of HSE mismanagement and of the scandalous disregard of this Government for the health and well-being of the midlands.</p>
            <p eId="para_2154">When announcing the back-on-call status of the hospital on 4 December, the HSE claimed it was giving no guarantee that Mullingar hospital will not be off-call again.  This is unacceptable.  During my meeting with the hospital manager and a representative of the HSE to discuss the off-call situation then, I also raised the urgent matter of the re-opening of the acute inpatient beds.  I was informed that the utilisation of these beds is dependent on the employment of an extra 28 medical personnel who are urgently needed to replace the recent loss of 30 staff at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">This is very much a catch-22 situation.   The Minister has removed the staff from the hospital and has, therefore, by extension removed the available beds that patients so urgently need.  I am extremely angry at the cold-blooded approach of the HSE to what should be a patient-driven, patient-friendly health sector.  Under the Minister's watch, patients are the last ones to matter in the system.  By taking beds out of the system, patients are being put at dangerous risk.  Patients are not numbers, they are real live people who bleed when cut and die when left on trolleys without treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">There is  no excuse for the HSE's  despicable failure to provide essential health care for the midlands.  Following the closure of Longford hospital in 1986, the people of Longford were guaranteed 24 hour, seven day a week emergency cover.  Left without a hospital of its own, County Longford was conned by the Minister for Health and Children and the promise of services at the Longford-Westmeath hospital.  These cutbacks are dirty tricks which are undermining people's confidence in the level of care available at Longford-Westmeath hospital.  We want guarantees that Mullingar hospital, which despite the cutbacks, is one of the top performing hospitals in the country with an excellent staff working hard on behalf of the people who attend there will be fully funded, with all outstanding works in relation to Phase 2B completed and acute beds restored.  We do not want or believe spin.  We want action and we want it immediately.</p>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_588">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Trevor Sargent)</from>
            <p eId="para_2157">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Bannon as ucht na ceiste a árdú agus aontaím leis gur ospidéal den scoth é Mullingar.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_2158">The HSE accepts that there was a problem in the emergency department at Mullingar Hospital earlier this month which required the hospital to be off-call for emergencies for 24 hours.  However, during this period, it was not necessary for any patient to be transferred by ambulance to the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore in accordance with the by-pass protocol.  Since then, all patients in the emergency department were either admitted or discharged within the target of six hours set by the HSE this year.  The hospital's budget for 2009 is in excess of €64 million, increased from €54.8 million in 2006.  The hospital has been recognised as being one of <i> </i>the most efficient in the country in the context of the annual casemix adjustment.  Last year, the hospital scored one of the highest in the country with a positive casemix adjustment of €1.977 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2159">It should be noted that inpatient activity at Mullingar hospital to the end of October was similar to last year, while day case activity was up by 6% year on year.  Up to end October this year, there were 27,436 emergency attendances, a reduction of 4.8% on the same period last year.  Mullingar hospital, in common with all other agencies, is required to manage its services within the approved allocation and to run its services within the approved employment ceiling.  It is envisaged that the hospital will break-even this year and will be within its employment ceiling by year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">In November, patients were transferred from old accommodation at Mullingar hospital to state-of-the-art accommodation in the newly upgraded wards at the hospital.  The new wards are a major improvement in terms of standard of care that can be afforded to patients.  Under the new arrangements, the number of inpatient beds has been reduced from 220 to 199, and the number of day beds has increased by 13, from 11 to 24.  In addition, there are five extra observation beds.  These changes are very much in line with international practice, which aims to encourage a greater emphasis on the practice of day care medicine.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">The revised bed complement in place as a result of the move to the new hospital has been fully endorsed by the consultant surgeons and consultant obstetricians at the hospital.  In addition, many discussions led by the clinical director have taken place with all relevant consultant staff at the hospital to increase the throughput of surgical and gynaecology work at the hospital.  The provision of additional day ward beds as detailed will facilitate this increase in workload.  The hospital has commenced a bed utilisation study with a view to establishing that all beds within the hospital are being utilised to maximum effect.  The results of this study will help to identify any barriers to maximum utilisation of the inpatient beds and hospital management will act on the results of the study as soon as it is finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">As previously noted, there has also been an increase in the number of observation unit beds from six to 11.  These beds are strategically located next to the emergency department to cater for the overflow of patients from the emergency department which can occur from time to time.  The hospital also intends to increase the throughput of patients through the medical assessment unit which will also alleviate pressure in the emergency department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">I am confident that the hospital will continue to provide the best possible quality of care for all its patients.</p>

            <p eId="para_2166">I have more than once raised this issue, most recently during questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is a little less than a scandal that such little progress on this matter has been made here or at European Union level.  I raise this issue this evening because of the urgent position in which two human rights activists find themselves, one of whom attended a conference in Cork, of which I am sure the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be aware, and was arrested on her way home and is now ill in prison.  The other, who is in prison in Lanzarote, is in the fifth week of her hunger strike.  The position in terms of her health is desperate.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">I became aware of the position of the Saharawi people some time after the original annexation of this territory, the old Spanish Sahara, by Morocco.  On 6 November 1976, King Hassan announced the discovery of a new and empty country and marched into what was the Spanish Sahara in violation of the natural expectation of the people to independence.  Since then, there have been many attempts at establishing some form of peace.  The Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, declared on 27 February 1976, is recognised by the African Union, of which Morocco is not part because of the African Union's acceptance of the SADR.  They are a very interesting people.  I stayed with them for some weeks and they have been visited by former Ministers for Foreign Affairs, former Deputies Andrews and Collins and many other parliamentarians.</p>

Scandalously, the European Union has signed an agreement through which it gives €224 million per annum to Morocco for the right, principally, of Spanish ships to fish in what are the waters of the Saharawi people.  Scandalously, too, an Irish company has attempted to sell shares and to seek investment for mining rights on land the annexed occupied rights of the Saharawi people.  From time to time, they come outside and attend international conferences to draw attention to the refugee camps, one of which I visited and stayed at in Tindouf on the Algerian border.  I have also crossed the Sahara to the wall to which I referred earlier.  I have visited the region four or five times.  The United Nations agencies speak of what the women and children suffer.  Now, when delegations are returning from these international conferences they are arrested and not allowed to return to Layaaoune.  That is why one is on hunger strike in Lanzarote.  It is also why another is in hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">In addition, there have been different approaches internationally to organise a UN-based referendum, but in all of the cases the Moroccan Government has insisted that it will not recognise any form of independence.  For all of these reasons, in a number of prisons brought to my attention, including Casablanca, Laayoune itself and others in Marrakesh, there are civilians who will be brought before military courts, prisoners who are not allowed to be visited, prisoners being submitted to degrading and inhuman punishments, and two women I mention who have been delegates to conferences here in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">Our concern is being expressed by our ambassador to Portugal, who also is our ambassador to Morocco.  However, I hope that before this weekend the ambassador will once again take up these issues and I would urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take it up with the Moroccan ambassador in Dublin.</p>

            <p eId="para_2171">Arís, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Ó hUigín as an cheist a ardú.  Bhí suim mhór agam éisteacht lena chúntas.  Tá súil agam gur féidir liom roinnt de na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh sé a fhreagairt.  Deanfaidh mé mo dhícheall ar son an Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha.</p>
            <p eId="para_2172">The Government is aware of this case and shares the concern expressed that every effort be made to resolve it speedily and happily.  Ms Aminatou Haidar, a human rights activist from Western Sahara, has been on hunger strike at Lanzarote Airport in the Canary Islands since mid-November.  She landed at Laayoune Airport in the Western Sahara on 14 November, returning from a visit to Spain, and was denied access by Moroccan immigration authorities, having refused to state her nationality as Moroccan on her landing card.  She was, therefore, returned to Lanzarote, from whence she had come, where she refused to leave the airport and commenced a hunger strike in protest.  Although not a Spanish national, Ms Haidar has Spanish residency, but she is understandably concerned that any decision on her part to remain in Spain would prohibit her return to her family in Western Sahara.</p>
            <p eId="para_2173">We share the widespread concerns about Ms Haidar's health, as she has now been on hunger strike for several weeks.  She is drinking sugared water, but had refused medical care from the Spanish authorities.  Our latest information is that she has today been admitted to hospital in Lanzarote at her own request.</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">Along with our EU partners, we are closely following the case and our embassy in Lisbon, which is accredited to Morocco, is also maintaining contact with EU missions resident in Rabat.  Our Spanish partners, as one would expect in the circumstances, are playing a leading role in trying to talk both to Ms Haidar and to the Moroccan authorities in order to come to a solution——</p>

            <p eId="para_2176">——which will resolve this issue and avert a tragedy.  The case has also been discussed at EU level with the Moroccan Government, and the EU Presidency issued a statement concerning her situation on 10 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">The position of the Moroccan authorities is that Ms Haidar is free to enter Morocco and that the immigration formalities required of her were the same as for other arriving passengers, and have been complied with by Ms Haidar on many previous occasions.  The Government has also been in direct contact with the Moroccan ambassador in Dublin on this issue.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has written to the ambassador regarding the concern which exists about Ms Haidar's health and well-being and to encourage the Moroccan Government to take speedy steps to alleviate and resolve the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">Turning to the broader issue which lies behind this case, we remain very concerned about the plight of the people of Western Sahara as a whole.  Ireland continues to support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, as well as the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in Western Sahara based on the principle of self-determination.  It is hoped that UN sponsored talks between the two sides can be continued, although it would have to be admitted that talks to date have made no progress, the last such discussions being held in March 2008.  An exploratory meeting to discuss the prospects for resuming direct negotiations took place last August, but no date for a further round of direct negotiations has been set.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">The Government regularly communicates its views on the situation in Western Sahara to the Moroccan authorities, including through the Moroccan ambassador here in Dublin.  We also raise issues related to human rights and to the importance of safeguarding freedom of movement and of expression for human rights defenders in both Morocco and Western Sahara.  These issues are also raised at EU level within the framework of the EU-Morocco dialogue.  The most recent Association Council with Morocco took place last week, in the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels.  The EU used this occasion to convey its concerns over the situation of Western Sahara, as well as the need to safeguard the rights of both Moroccan and Saharawi human rights defenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">On behalf of the Government, I repeat the call by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Moroccan authorities to take all possible steps to avert a tragedy in this case.  I also call on Ms Haidar, who has successfully brought world attention to the cause for which she struggles, to end her hunger strike before her health is permanently damaged.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English</from>
            <p eId="para_2181">I am taking this matter on behalf of myself and Deputies Crawford and McEntee who could not be here to join in the debate.  I am glad to see that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is present.  I appreciate that.  It is important that we have a good discussion on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2182">Before a Minister or Fianna Fáil colleagues try to accuse Fine Gael of being against progress or delaying important infrastructure, I want to make clear that we are not.  Let us be clear, Fine Gael wants the national grid improved.  We recognise and support the need for the national electricity grid to be upgraded and expanded to international best standards as speedily as possible, but we disagree with the Government's approach.  We are determined to ensure that we have explored all avenues and all alternatives on how this can be done.  It might be quicker to roll it out underground, if it is proven to be viable, reliable and affordable.  Many other projects that went overhead are still not completed ten years later.  We have a responsibility to establish if this is possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">Fine Gael has kept an open mind on this but I am sorry to say the Minister has not, nor have his Fianna Fáil colleagues.  When this debate first started, I was singing the praises of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, as an open-minded person who would consider and look at all options, but I am afraid he has not given this his full attention with an open mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">Simply because EirGrid is a State body does not mean it is correct. Most of those involved in EirGrid, ESB International and the ESB, have a history of involvement in overhead transmission and pylons.  That is their job and their expertise.  I accept they have researched the other end of it lately because they were forced to, but one must not forget that their jobs and careers were based in other transmission forms.  We must have an open mind and a proper discussion on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2185">As local Deputies we are annoyed that this submission to An Bord Pleanála is to be made this week, before Christmas.  It is the wrong time to do it and it causes doubt and fear among the people.  Christmas is a time for peace and happiness at home.  The prospect of overhead pylons and power transmission lines over people's homes, through their field, etc., scares people.  Rightly or wrongly, they are afraid.  It is unfair to start this ball rolling again on Christmas week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2186">I fully accept that EirGrid has stated that it has looked for more time to make up for the time lost over Christmas.  There are Fianna Fáil Deputies claiming they got this done.  I do not believe that because the newspapers had the advertisements weeks ago.  That should be clarified as well because we cannot have Deputies messing with this serious topic.</p>
            <p eId="para_2187">It is the wrong time to proceed with this and it is unfair.  I am disappointed that it has happened.  If the Minister has any influence over EirGrid, I would ask him to ask the company to hold back until after Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2188">It is also wrong to lodge this application before we have a full and proper debate on the subject of transmission power lines.  The Minister was forced into the Ecofys report and other reports and discussions over the past year and a half since this started, but EirGrid commissioned two reports which have yet to be discussed in this House or in the relevant committee, namely, the PB Power report and the TEPCO report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2189">We all have managed to see the PB Power report and I question much of its contents.  In my view, it contains mistruths.  The report should be brought to committee and should be discussed because it is relevant to how we go forward from here.  Separate to this application, it is relevant to the overall policy on overhead-underground lines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2190">I refer to the TEPCO, Tokyo Electric Power Company, report which EirGrid has made out to be the be-all and end-all during meetings.  It maintains this is a very important report and that it proves the case made.  However, it is still not published and, as of yesterday, we could not get it.  These reports should be available to the House and should be debated and discussed.  I trust they will be read by the Minister with an open mind.  I call on the Minister to give a guarantee that regardless of when planning is applied for, the reports will be discussed here during January and that they will receive proper scrutiny and investigation.  As local public representatives and on behalf of the North East Pylon Pressure, NEPP, group, we have questions we wish to put.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">NEPP is an excellent group that carries out excellent research.  We have questions we wish to put on behalf of the all the residents of the north east.  They need to know that we are doing our job properly as politicians and acting responsibly.  This is a very important matter and there will be serious consequences if we get it wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_2192">Potentially, we could be making a great mistake.  Other Governments are beginning to act responsibly in respect of this matter, including the Danish Government, which has set out its thinking on how to proceed, how to properly research the matter and what it intends to do.  I accept the Minister did not start this process.  His predecessor as Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, started it before the general election in 2007.  However, the Minister is continuing it.  He is in a very important position to influence the way in which the national grid is rolled out from here onwards.  This is a big decision and the Minister has a good deal of influence.  EirGrid maintains that it responds to Government policy.  Basically, it does what it is told to do in respect of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2193">This House sets the policy and the agenda.  The Minister is in charge and I again call on him to give this matter some consideration.  I realise he is a busy man, but I suggest he should take some time out and read the reports, including the ASKON report and, if he has time, to meet Professor Noack.</p>
            <p eId="para_2194">I do not believe EirGrid has given proper consideration to the proposals.  I question the way in which EirGrid has done its job in many areas, including public relations and its consultation with people.  In addition, the submission of an application on the week approaching Christmas was wrong.  This is no way for a State body to operate, especially one with such an important job, that is, to ensure the national grid is expanded and improved quickly.  I am disappointed with EirGrid.  There are many questions it has not answered.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2197">While I have no direct role in the operational planning and construction of transmission system infrastructure, the Government's policy objective is to ensure that energy is consistently available with minimal risk to supply disruption, to meet the needs of businesses and domestic consumers.  It is EirGrid's role, as the national transmission system operator, to develop and upgrade the transmission system to meet ongoing and future electricity needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2198">In October 2008, EirGrid published Grid25 which sets out its strategy for the development of the transmission grid to meet Ireland's electricity needs to 2025.  The capacity of Ireland's bulk transmission system has remained largely unchanged for the past 20 years, despite a growth of 150% in electricity demand being carried by the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2199">Grid25 represents a cornerstone for our economic development and will provide high quality, high voltage bulk power supply to enable the regions to attract future industry, boost existing industry and create employment in area where it would not otherwise occur.  It is also an essential prerequisite for the increased integration of renewable electricity, the development of an indigenous renewable energy sector and the achievement of Ireland's 40% renewable electricity target.  EirGrid predicts that parts of the grid will have reached capacity within the next five to ten years.  Therefore, upgrading of the infrastructure is vital.</p>
            <p eId="para_2200">As part of its ongoing grid development programme and in line with the Government's energy White Paper, EirGrid is currently planning the construction and re-enforcement of a number of transmission lines.  These include the proposed 138 km, 400 kV Meath Tyrone interconnection development project.  The project is being undertaken in co-operation with Northern Ireland Electricity.  As a result of doubling the current power transfer capacity between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it will promote better competition, facilitate renewable energy and ensure a future secure supply of electricity throughout the north east.</p>
            <p eId="para_2201">EirGrid has been consulting extensively on the Meath-Tyrone interconnection development project since November 2007.  As part of these preplanning consultations, EirGrid was required by An Bord Pleanála to consider three potential routes for the project and to consult on these routes.  Following extensive studies, route corridor options the project were developed and were presented for public consultation.  In April 2009, EirGrid nominated one preferred route corridor for each 400 kV power line project for further study and commenced discussions with landowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2202">EirGrid advertised its intention to submit its planning consent application to An Bord Pleanála on Wednesday, 16 December.  It is currently circulating copies of the planning application for the 400 kV Meath Tyrone project to statutory consultees.  The application will be lodged with An Bord Pleanála once this process is completed.  The planning process provides for a consultation period of seven weeks.  Recognising that the application is being submitted prior to Christmas, EirGrid has decided that the statutory consultation period will commence only in the new year.  In addition, the consultation period will be extended by a further three weeks, to ten weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2203">The environmental impact statement will be available to download on-line and be on display in several venues throughout Meath, Cavan and Monaghan as soon as the planning application is made.  This information will be publicised widely through local press and radio as soon as the application is lodged.  By submitting the application now rather than in the New Year, EirGrid is maximising the time available to people to review and formulate views on the application.</p>
            <p eId="para_2204">EirGrid commissioned a report by TEPCO, Tokyo Electric Power Company, to examine technical issues associated with integrating underground high voltage cables with the Irish electricity transmission system.  This work is additional to the report by PB Power which EirGrid published earlier this year, and which examined structural and cost issues associated with high voltage, long distance transmission infrastructure.  I understand that the TEPCO report will be made publically available by EirGrid on its website, <i>www.eirgrid.com</i>, from Friday afternoon.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">The Department and EirGrid have kept the relevant Oireachtas committees informed of developments on grid development generally and issues relating to the proposed Meath-Tyrone development.  Several reports have already been furnished to Deputies and detailed discussions have taken place with the relevant Oireachtas committees.  I confirm that EirGrid will make the TEPCO report available to Members of these committees and any other Deputies who wish to receive a copy.  An Bord Pleanála is the statutory planning authority for all strategic infrastructure projects and EirGrid is submitting a full environmental impact statement, in addition to these reports to An Bord Pleanála for consideration as part of its planning consent application.</p>

          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_2208">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important issue for the Adjournment debate.  What started out as a trickle some weeks ago is beginning to develop into a flood.  Farmers have begun to contact my clinics and, I am sure, the constituency clinics of many other Deputies during recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_2209">REPS, rural environmental protection scheme, 4 payments and all other REPS payments have always been paid out in November or during the first week in December at the latest.  Following contact with Department officials yesterday, I have further cause for concern.  They indicated these payments were being processed but that they would not put up for payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2210">We are within one week of Christmas.  It is no reflection on the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, but I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, is not here to answer these questions.  I trust the reply that will be given presently will clarify the situation.  Those affected are from the farming community that has been decimated as a result of the recent mini budgets and major budgets and all the various cutbacks in payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2211">I am not referring to money that will go to bank accounts.  It goes towards the repayment of bank loans but it will not be used as savings.  It will go straight back into the economy.  This affects the farmers that have had farm waste management payments delayed for three years.  Many will go to the banks to make repayments with these payments.  Many have had child welfare supplements cut or have experienced delays in third level grant payments.  The same people are involved in many of these cases.  Within a few days of Christmas these people have been told they may not receive their REPS 4 payments.  The REPS 4 was withdrawn overnight last May and this has excluded thousands of farmers.  It is an important issue in my constituency, Mayo, which has the highest number of REPS farmers in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_2212">It is vital that this issue be resolved.  In the farming community, incomes have dropped by 28% in 2009, on top of a 13% drop the previous year.  This is untenable.  These are the farmers who see services being cut in the constituency.  Last week, the Teagasc office in Castlebar was closed down and the same thing happened earlier in the year in Crossmolina.  The agricultural offices in Claremorris and Ballina are to be centralised.  There is a disconnect.</p>
          <p eId="para_2213">I hope the Minister of State has good news for these farmers and that the money will be paid.  There is a window of Monday and Tuesday next week after which it will be too late.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that these payments will be made in the next few days.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_602">
          <from>Deputy Trevor Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_2214">Mo bhuíochas don Teachta O'Mahony as an ceist thábhachtach seo a árdú.  I hope to answer the question to the Deputy's satisfaction.  He will be aware of the background, namely, that REPS 4 is a measure under the current rural development programme 2007-13.  It is subject to stringent EU regulations which require detailed administrative checks, including plan checks, on all applications to be completed before the first 2009 payments can commence.  All applications, not only those applications received this year, but also those received in 2007 and 2008, must undergo the comprehensive administrative check required before any payments can issue.  This year, the work involved checks on some 28,800 files.</p>
          <p eId="para_2215">I am pleased to announce this major exercise has been completed in the last few days and my Department has begun the process of paying farmers in REPS 4.  The first pay run was started today and covered 10,013 farmers who will receive payments totalling €31.2 million into their bank account in the next few days.  The payment represents the first stage of their 2009 payment, which is 75% of the total due to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2216">The Department's officials continue to process payments and I expect significant numbers of files to be brought to the payment stage in the next few days.  Payment runs will continue to be made regularly so that farmers can receive their entitlements as soon as possible before year end or early in the New Year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2217">The second phase of the REPS 4 payments for 2009, the 25% balancing payment, can be made as soon as the last on-farm inspection of the year has taken place.  This programme of work is almost complete and I hope we will be in a position to start getting the 25% payments out by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2218">Although it is important that the REPS 4 payments have commenced and will continue, I wish to point out that there are some 34,000 farmers in REPS 3 who have got, or will get, payments this year.  These payments have been issuing since January and, as of today, we have already paid €209 million this year.  Tomorrow, another €8.6 million will be paid to more than 1,500 REPS 3 farmers and these payments, too, will continue to issue as fast as we can clear them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2219">REPS payments due to farmers this year will reach the highest ever levels and this trend will continue next year.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, recently secured Dáil approval for a Supplementary Estimate for the allocation of an additional €39 million to REPS for 2009, bringing the total allocation for this year to an unprecedented €369 million.  The Minister and I are delighted that arrangements to spend this additional funding are under way and that the payments will provide a very welcome boost to many hard-pressed families at this difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_2220">REPS has been one of the most successful schemes operated by my Department since its launch in 1994.  It has delivered multiple benefits to the environment in terms of water quality, biodiversity, conservation and landscape enhancement.  It has also brought welcome income benefits to farmers, with over €313 million paid out to REPS participants last year, a potential €339 million this year and a total of over €2 billion paid since its inception in 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_2221">Notwithstanding the Government's decision to close REPS to new entrants in July of this year — a decision which, unfortunately, was unavoidable, given the state of the public finances — those farmers who are already in REPS will have their five-year contracts honoured.  As I mentioned, we still have some 34,000 in REPS 3 and almost 29,000 in REPS 4.  There are another 1,600 applications, or thereabouts, that came in between the annual applications deadline of 15 May 2009 and the time the scheme closed in July.  They will be processed and, if successful, will begin five-year contracts in 2010 and therefore there will still be farmers in REPS right up to the end of 2014.  By the time the scheme finally comes to an end, payments will have topped €3 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_2222">When REPS was closed to new entrants in July, the Minister announced  he was starting discussions with the European Commission about introducing a new agri-environment scheme in 2010.  At the time, the available funding, which came mainly from modulated funds negotiated under the CAP health check, came to some €180 million for the period up to 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_2223">Following the Budget Statement last week, however, the Minister announced that the Minister for Finance has agreed to provide for the launch of the new scheme at a rate of up to €5,000 for approximately 10,000 participants, which corresponds roughly with the numbers leaving REPS in 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_2224">Outline proposals for the new scheme were sent to the European Commission earlier this year, following an open consultation process.  There have been discussions at official level since then, the most recent of those being yesterday in Brussels.  We are at an advanced stage in the negotiations with the Commission and I am confident that the new scheme, as part of an amendment to Ireland's rural development programme, can be put to the EU rural development committee for approval at its January meeting.</p>

            <p eId="para_2226">I believe that Ireland should have its own National Opera Company.  In this regard, it is my intention to establish a National Opera Company based in the capital.  I intend that over the coming months my Department, supported by the Arts Council, Opera Theatre Company and Opera Ireland, will drive the process which will culminate in the formation of this new national company. Plans for the formation of this new venture are now moving ahead apace. I am in discussions with the Chairs of the two companies involved, together with the Chair of the Arts Council, to advance the realisation of this ambition.  The technical funding of opera will remain unchanged in 2010.  This means that the opera companies will receive their allocations from the Arts Council as they did in 2009.  For the September 2010/September 2011 season, my Department will fund the new National Opera Company.</p>

            <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Deputy Martin Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2232">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 18, 21, 23 and 214 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2233">The abolition of the air travel tax was just one of a range of measures recommended in the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group as part of a Framework for Action for the period to 2013.  I refer the Deputy to my earlier answer to Priority Question No.   47909/09 in respect of progress on the Survival Actions in the Framework.  The Government has to consider any measure with tax or spending implications within the wider context of fiscal sustainability and economic renewal.  The recommendations of the Renewal Group were taken into account in framing the Budget — along with the views of the Commission on Taxation. The Commission recommended that a review should be undertaken by Government to assess the effects of the air travel tax on business in general and tourism in particular in the context of the pending inclusion of air travel in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme from 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">The Renewal Group based its Framework on its various consultations and consideration of tourism strategy.  It did not commission formal quantitative assessments.  I am advised that some analysis was carried out for Tourism Ireland when the tax was first proposed. This concluded that the impact of the travel tax on aggregate demand for air travel may not be significant although, in specific markets and at specific times, the impact of the €10 additional cost could have a negative impact on demand.  I am also advised that, in a submission to the Commission on Taxation, the Chairman of Fáilte Ireland stated that its research estimated that the introduction of the tax would result in a net loss of over €30m to the Irish economy on an annual basis.  I am also aware that three airlines commissioned a study of the impact of the Air Travel Tax, which they published last month.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">However, the range of factors which affect the numbers of passengers — including inbound tourists — are so varied that any such attempt to put a definite figure on the impact of a single tax has to rest on a large number of assumptions.  Even if a study's conclusions are robust, they must be seen in the context of the overall financial challenges we face.  The air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure and, in its absence, the revenue would be sought elsewhere.   The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">As I said earlier, the recommendation to abolish the Air Travel Tax was only part of a wide-ranging set of Measures recommended in the Framework for Action which forms, from a tourism perspective, the strategic basis on which Government is responding to the current difficulties.  I am fully aware of the many issues affecting the tourist industry, including the issues of costs and competitiveness.  Drawing on the Report of the Group, I am determined — as I have already indicated in reply to earlier Priority Questions — to take the lead in identifying and driving the right measures to assist in ensuring that tourism survives and remains a major industry for Ireland and also to position the sector for recovery and growth as the Irish and global economies get back on track.</p>

The priority now is to work with the relevant local authorities in completing the remaining 12 pool projects which are included in the current round.  Since 2000 and, to date in 2009, total expenditure under the current round of the programme has been €142.7m and funding of €7.5m has been provided for 2010 to support existing projects. Five new pools opened to the public in 2009, at Athy and Naas, Co. Kildare, Dundrum, Co. Dublin, Claremorris, Co. Mayo and Roscrea, Co, Tipperary.</p>

            <p eId="para_2240">I have not received representations regarding the assignment of causeway coast status to Donegal's northern peninsulas. Furthermore the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism has been informed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Northern Ireland, who have responsibility for Tourism that they are unaware of any such representations by the National Trust or the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2241">In terms of cooperation generally, the Deputy will be aware that tourism is one of the recognised sectors for North-South Cooperation and in particular, Tourism Ireland, a north south body, markets the island of Ireland as a destination overseas. Tourism Ireland works closely with Fáilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to encourage overseas visitors to explore the island as widely as possible. In the Netherlands, for example, promotional activity highlights Donegal and the North West region jointly with the Giant's Causeway and the Causeway Coastal Route.</p>
            <p eId="para_2242">I am glad to report to the House that yesterday I attended the North South Ministerial Council tourism sectoral meeting at which a presentation was made by Tourism Ireland on progress in 2009 and its marketing plan for 2010.  The 2010 plans which Tourism Ireland expect will deliver growth of 3% in visitor numbers next year were well received and the budget to fund these initiatives is now in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_2244">Primary responsibility for the support and promotion of film-making in Ireland in respect of both the indigenous sector and inward productions is a matter for the Irish Film Board (IFB). This agency is funded through my Department and is independent of the Department in its operations.  My Department's primary operational role in supporting the film sector relates to the administration of elements of Section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 that provides tax relief for investments in qualifying films. A qualifying film is a film for which the Revenue Commissioners have issued a certificate under Section 481. The types of film eligible for certification are — feature film, television drama, creative documentary and animation (whether computer generated or otherwise, but excluding computer games).</p>
            <p eId="para_2245">This scheme is kept under regular review in conjunction with the Irish Film Board and any enhancements necessary to retain or regain competitiveness are addressed and brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance as appropriate. The scheme was amended and enhanced in the Finance Acts of 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and most recently in 2008. The amendments in 2008 extended the scheme for a further four years until the end of 2012, increased the overall ceiling on qualifying expenditure from €35m to €50m, increased the individual investor cap for those wishing to invest finance in film in Ireland to €50,000 per annum from the previous limit of €31,750 and increased the relief on that investment to 100% from 80%. Approval from the European Commission to introduce these changes was secured in March and the Minister for Finance subsequently signed the Commencement Orders on 16 March. These were significant enhancements and have resulted in 43 film projects being approved to date in 2009, up from 38 in 2008, with a total Irish spend of €102m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2246">I recently established an Audiovisual Content Production Industry Strategy Framework Group that will assist in providing a clear vision for the future of the industry. The whole area of computer games development will be examined as part of the work programme of the Group. Following the receipt of the Framework Report in the New Year I will examine it and if there is an opportunity to further develop the industry here, then I will pursue it in the ambit of extending the Section 481 Scheme and will bring it to the Minister for Finance seeking approval.</p>

Most of the remainder of the capital allocation, over €600,000, will be used to provide for capital maintenance at the National Aquatic Centre.

In recent years, allocations to the Arts Council have represented significant amounts of taxpayer's money in any context and have effectively transformed the arts, by facilitating increased access to and participation in the full spectrum of art forms around the country.  Since 2002, Exchequer funding for the Arts Council has increased by 45% from €47.67million in 2002 to €69.15 million in 2010.  In these difficult times I was delighted to be able to secure funding of this level for the Arts Council.  For the arts, culture and film sector in 2010 I have secured €167m, an adjustment of 6% on 2009.  The Government's sustained commitment to the arts is evidenced by this substantial level of funding.

            <p eId="para_2263">A draft National Sports Facilities Strategy 2010-2015 has now been completed within my Department and has been circulated to a number of Government Departments and other relevant bodies for observations.  Following receipt of these comments I intend to submit the strategy to the Government for its consideration and publication. The aim of the National Sports Facilities strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  The strategy also identifies the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact in the relevant areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2269">We all appreciate the important role that sport plays in our society in promoting healthy lifestyles, creating a sense of identity and belonging, channeling energy in rewarding activity and bringing people together. I can assure the Deputy that this Government is committed to sport and believes in the contribution it can make to our society, for individuals and for communities. Thus the importance of the sport sector to the country is reflected in the commitments contained in the Renewed Programme for Government and the funding secured for the sector under Budget 2010.  I am committed to increasing and developing participation and interest in sport, improving standards of performance and to developing sports facilities thereby contributing to healthier lifestyles and an improved overall quality of life.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">A total of €48m has been provided for the Sports Capital<b> </b>Programme in 2010. The provision of €48m for Sports Capital projects will ensure that commitments arising in 2010 from previous allocations under the Sports Capital Programme will continue to be made and that a range of modern facilities will be brought in to use in 2010. Since 1998, over €725m has been allocated to 7,400 sports projects all over the country.  Funding for the Irish Sports Council for 2010 is €49.8m, a reduction of 4% on the 2009 levels, but is a significant investment by Government to enable this important agency maintain existing programmes and build on recent significant progress in all areas including Local Sports Partnerships, Buntús, Women in Sport, Older People and Sport, Youth Field Sports and the High Performance Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2271">The Lansdowne Road Stadium, a key sports infrastructure project, remains on schedule to be completed on time and within budget in 2010. The allocation by the Department of €4.5m in 2010 represents the retention amount of the Government's funding for the project of €191m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2272">Ireland is the third largest breeder of thoroughbreds in the world and Irish horses and jockeys consistently succeed at the highest level. An estimated 27,000 jobs are supported by both the horse and greyhound industry in Ireland and significant inward investment is attracted to the country. Taking account of the need to continue to support both industries, €59.3m is being allocated by Government to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund in 2010. This is a reduction of 13% on the funding provided in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2273">Unfortunately it will not be possible to proceed with the main Campus project in the short term because of financial constraints.  An amount of €3m however is being provided to the National Sports Campus for the refurbishment of the former Marine Institute building at Abbotstown, which will be used as a headquarters for national governing bodies of sport. Most of the remainder of the €3.6m overall capital allocation will be used to provide for capital maintenance at the National Aquatic Centre.  I am satisfied that the budgets provided for the various sports programmes in a very difficult budgetary environment will enable is to continue with the pursuit of our strategic objectives in the sport areas.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_616">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2275">The Tánaiste and I are very concerned about the current delays being experienced by businesses and individuals in the processing of statutory redundancy payments and we have taken measures to improve this situation.  However, the delays in processing are not generally of the order referred to by the Deputy if all relevant information and supporting documents have been supplied to the Department and are in order.  Currently, the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 8 to 9 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2276">On the basis of the latest figures available to end November 2009 these indicate that, on a national basis, the number of redundancy claims awaiting processing stands at 42,591.  I should point out that my Department has, since 1 January processed 45,201 claims and made corresponding payments amounting to €287m (provisional figures) which results in average weekly payments to the value of €6.5m being issued.  Given the increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first eleven months of 2009 is 73,024, up 96% on the same period last year (37,257).  This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2277">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2278">the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_2280">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_2281">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_2282">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2283">The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2773">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned on 3 September, 2009, claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  This application awaits processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 8 to 9 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first eleven months of 2009 is 73,024. This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2777">the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;</p>
            <p eId="para_2778">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_2779">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_2780">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_2781">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2782">The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</p>

The 2007-2012 Seed and Venture Capital Scheme was launched to improve access to finance for SMEs and to further develop the Seed and Venture Capital Industry in Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has committed to investing €175m under this programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2791">The Bank of Ireland Seed and Early Stage Equity Fund, which I launched in November of this year, is the eighth venture capital fund to be supported under the current scheme.  Under this €26m fund, Bank of Ireland has committed €17m and Enterprise Ireland has committed €8m, with the balance of €1m being committed by the University of Limerick Foundation.  This fund will focus on export orientated high potential start-up companies that operate in the technology (including green technology), food and financial services sectors, in addition to supporting patent and patent pending projects within Irish third and fourth level institutions.  The fund is mandated to invest between €100,000 and €500,000 in companies within the outlined investment criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_2793">Overall, my Department's Estimate for 2010, including the National Training Fund, shows an increase in expenditure of €70.7 million compared to the 2009 Estimate.  The additional funding will primarily be used to protect jobs and support those who are unemployed.  Notwithstanding the overall increase in my Department's Estimate for 2010, many Subheads will have reduced allocations next year compared to 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2794">The areas in which savings will be achieved are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2795">Reduction in funding to FÁS for training those in employment as increased resources are directed at training people who are unemployed (€6 million saving in 2010 compared to 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_2796">Reduction in grant for Community Employment training and materials overhead (€7.6 million saving).</p>
            <p eId="para_2797">Reduction in part-time third level places and ending of Science Challenge within FAS (€4.5 million saving).</p>
            <p eId="para_2798">Cessation of the FÁS Training Allowance to new entrants who do not qualify for Jobseeker's Benefit/Allowance (€3.2 million saving).</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">Reduction in Current Non-Pay funding for agencies and Offices under the aegis of the Department (€5.761 million saving).</p>
            <p eId="para_2800">Reduction in Current Non-Pay funding for Science and Technology programmes (€1.121 million saving).</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">Reduction in CE/Job Initiative allowances (€5 million saving).</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">Reduction in allocations to a range of other programmes and services (€1.343 million saving).</p>
            <p eId="para_2803">Reduction in Capital expenditure compared to 2009 (€14.3 million saving on 2009 base-line figure).</p>
            <p eId="para_2804">In addition, a reduction of €39.658 million was made to my Department's Estimate for 2010 in respect of payroll and related adjustments which will be distributed across my Department, its Offices and its agencies in the Revised Estimates Volume in the New Year.  When these payroll reductions are taken into consideration, administration costs across my Department, its Offices and agencies will fall by 10% in 2010.  Payments made to FAS participants will also reduce by approximately €15.5 million in 2010, in line with changes to social welfare allowances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2805">The measures outlined above are contributing to the stabilisation of the public finances while at the same time enabling resources to be targeted at helping enterprises to grow and create new jobs, maintaining investment in the Smart Economy, and assisting those who are unemployed through re-skilling and other appropriate supports.</p>

         the role the county enterprise boards will have in assessing flood damage to businesses, homes and the farming community around the country; and if she intends utilising the boards to assist in this project.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2852">As enterprise support agencies the interaction of the County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) with their local Community is generally confined to matters of delivering financial and non-financial supports to eligible local enterprises in the micro-enterprise sector and to the promotion of entrepreneurial activities.  It was in the context of this remit that I recently asked the CEBs to collect information on the impact of the flooding on their local client businesses in order to assist in framing the overall Government response to the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2853">The national response to the flooding crisis was overseen by the Emergency Response Coordination Committee (operating under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government). An integral part of this response is the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme which provides means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damage in their homes and is being administered by the local Community Welfare Services. This Scheme does not cover commercial or business interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">In relation to businesses affected by flooding damage the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland are available to offer advice to client businesses and their normal financial supports remain available to eligible clients. However it is primarily for the Insurance Sector to respond to affected businesses under the terms of their commercial insurance policies. This Sector should respond quickly and appropriately to claims and should ensure that payments flow back to policyholders to facilitate early resumption of business. In addition the Banking Sector has a role to play in supporting businesses coping with the impact of flood damage.  It is imperative that such businesses receive supportive responses from banks to requests for working capital loans and re-stocking loans and for any temporary adjustments to loan facilities already in operation.  Some individual insurance companies and banks have committed publicly to offering speedy and appropriate assistance to businesses impacted by the floods.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">While the CEBs have gathered some information on their client businesses that have been affected by flooding they have no broad-based role in assessing actual flood damage to businesses or in gathering information on, or assessing flood damage to, domestic premises or farm premises or the wider community in general nor indeed would they have the capacity to undertake such a role.

The figures as set out for 2010 in relation to FÁS administration and general expenses will be reduced as part of the Revised Estimates process to take account of the reduction in the public sector pay bill as announced on Budget day.  The additional short term training places announced in the Budget for 2010 will be funded from the 2010 FÁS Budget and will be delivered through efficiency savings.</p>

            <p eId="para_2908">The National Construction Centre at Mount Lucas was established to provide training of plant construction operators, including delivery of the full range of Construction Skills Certification Scheme programmes and Safepass, for which FÁS is the designated competent authority under the relevant Statutory Instrument (Recognition of Professional Qualifications Regulations 2008, SI no 139 of 2008). The Centre focuses on the development of skills used in Civil Engineering and Commercial Building sectors.  Currently there are 1 Assistant Manager (Grade 7), 1 Instructor (Grade 8) and 1 Administration Assistant (Grade 10) based in the Centre. These are supplemented when necessary by technical support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2909">In 2009 two courses took place with a total of 10 trainees.  One course is already scheduled for 2010, and more will be rolled out during the year. The mix will depend on the numbers presenting for training and the type of training required. Provision could therefore consist of 4 Construction Plant courses with 24 trainees or an alternative mix could be 3 Construction Plant courses with 18 trainees; 3 Cranes courses with 6 trainees (lower ratio) and 2 Banksman courses with 2 trainees (lower ratio).  The costs in 2009 were made up of staff costs (€207,115), overhead costs (€191,000), training allowances (€26,603 to end November) and other training costs (€41,854) including some one-off set-up costs. The budget for 2010 has yet to be finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_2911">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 7 September 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.  This claim awaits processing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2912">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted by post from March 2009 and those filed online from April 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 8 to 9 months depending on the manner of filing the application.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from June 2009.  Given the unprecedented increase in Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department since late 2008 it has proved impossible to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims with a cumulative figure for the first eleven months of 2009 is 73,024. This figure exceeds the claims lodged for the full year 2008 (40,607) and 2008 was, of itself, an exceptional year as compared with earlier years when claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2913">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2914">the reassignment of 26.7 additional staff (full time equivalents) from other areas of the Department to the Redundancy Payments area since early 2009 with ongoing review of trends and demands.  The current number of staff serving in the Redundancy Payments Section in terms of full time equivalents is 52.5;</p>
            <p eId="para_2915">the prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Redundancy Payments Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_2916">the establishment of a special call handling facility to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses who are naturally concerned about their payments, using the facilities and cooperation of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).  This centre has received an average of 12,500 calls per month this year with an estimated 60% relating to redundancy payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_2917">The provision of better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_2918">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against outstanding tax liabilities with the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2919">The Tánaiste and I continue to monitor closely the impact of these changes against the continuing influx of redundancy claims and will consider further measures to deal with the situation should current measures prove to be inadequate.</p>

            <p eId="para_2921">The Employment Subsidy Scheme is designed to support the maintenance of vulnerable jobs and prevent people from being made redundant. As a result of the First Call, companies have now committed, as part of their application, to retaining in excess of 35,000 jobs.  The Second Call is open to exporting and non-exporting companies from all sectors of the economy that employ more than 10 employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2922">The aim of the Employment Subsidy Scheme is to maximise the number of jobs retained and to ensure that the funding available for the Scheme is utilised to its full potential. It is also intended that deadweight and displacement effects would be minimised by ensuring that a multiple of jobs subsidised will be retained and the scope for firms employing less than 10 people to offer substantial commitment in this regard is very limited. The second call criteria, apart from the broadening of the eligibility to non-exporting firms and to include short time jobs, are identical to the First Call as required to be consistent with the Temporary Framework under which the EU approved the funding for the scheme.</p>

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned on 7 April, 2009, claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2925">In this case, as in all cases where the employer claims inability to pay the employee(s) statutory redundancy, the Department requires the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. This includes providing the latest set of audited accounts for the company as well as certification from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the fact that the employer has insufficient assets to pay the redundancy entitlements.  Providing this documentation is submitted and is in order, the Department pays the employee(s) directly from the Social Insurance Fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_2926">In this case, supporting information required from the employer was not provided to my Department.  The employee has been advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, this allows the Department to make payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.  This is the uniform procedure adopted by my Department in relation to all claims received where the Employer is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2942">I am aware that because of previous claims experience, householders in different parts of the country, including areas in Dublin, have found it difficult to obtain insurance against flood damage.  This is because the decision to provide any specific form of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter based on the assessment an insurer will make of the risks involved and is one which neither I nor the Financial Regulator have any influence over. This risk assessment process which insurance companies apply is essential if a company is to be able to provide its services over the longer term and continue to remain solvent. Unfortunately, this means on occasions they have difficulty approving certain types of business because the risk of claims based on previous experience is too high.</p>
            <p eId="para_2943">It should be noted however that the Government is very conscious of the difficulties caused to certain householders by their inability to obtain insurance against flood damage. This is a problem which will almost certainly have been exacerbated by the recent flooding and consequently will have to be considered as part of its broader review of this general area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2957">It is estimated that the national debt will be some €76 billion at end-2009. The main factor in the projected increase in the national debt over the period 2010-2014 is the Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for each of these years. The Exchequer Borrowing Requirement for the years to 2014, as outlined in Table 10 on page C.20 of Budget 2010, is set out in Table 1 below. Based on these projections, the estimated debt servicing interest costs are also set out below. The National Treasury Management Agency have advised that, as is usual, these estimates were prepared on the basis of the prevailing market conditions for Irish Government bonds.</p>

            <p eId="para_3001">I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 to 68, inclusive, and 70 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3002">Table 10 of the <i>Stability Programme Update — December 2009, </i>published on Budget day, sets out the projections for the 2009-2014 period which underpin the budgetary arithmetic. The underlying economic forecasts that are consistent with these fiscal projections are set out in Table 4 of the Stability Programme Update.</p>
            <p eId="para_3003">In terms of the key items that make up non-voted (Central Fund) current expenditure, non-voted capital expenditure, non-tax revenue and capital resources, the <i>White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31 December 2010</i>, gives a detailed breakdown for 2009 and 2010 on a pre-Budget basis of these items. With the exception of non-voted (Central Fund) current expenditure, the estimates included in the White Paper for 2009 and 2010 for non-tax revenue, non-voted capital expenditure and capital resources were unchanged in the Budget. The White Paper is available on www.budget.gov.ie and was published on 5 December last.</p>
            <p eId="para_3004">
              <b>Non Voted (Central Fund) Current Expenditure</b>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_3005">The main item under non-voted (Central Fund) current Expenditure is debt servicing costs.  It is estimated that over the forecast period, interest costs on the national debt will amount to approximately 70% on average of the overall Central Fund expenditure as set out in Table 10 of the Stability Programme Update for the years 2010-2014. As already outlined, the <i>White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31 December 2010 </i>sets out the detailed pre-Budget breakdown of items under this heading for the period 2009 and 2010. With the exception of debt servicing there was no change to these estimates in the Budget. As the post-budget Exchequer Borrowing Requirement was lower than that set out on a pre-budget basis in the White Paper, savings of the order of €200 million on debt interest costs were factored into the budgetary arithmetic.</p>
            <p eId="para_3006">
              <b>Non-Voted Capital Expenditure</b>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_3007">The main item under Non-Voted Capital Expenditure is FEOGA payments. FEOGA payments are short term payments to finance Agriculture CAP expenditure in the final quarter of the year, in particular the Single farm payment. The CAP expenditure is fully funded by the European Union but recoupment is paid in arrears.  Therefore FEOGA payments in the final quarter of the year are financed by the Exchequer and recouped from the EU in the following year and recorded as a Capital Resource.  Therefore FEOGA is neutral on the Exchequer over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3008">
              <b>Capital Resources</b>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_3009">The main item under Capital Resources are, as outlined above, FEOGA receipts. The other main components under this heading are other EU receipts, such as Cohesion Fund and ERDF receipts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3010">
              <b>Non-Tax Revenue</b>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_3011">The main components of Non-Tax Revenue are the surplus incomes from the Central Bank and the National Lottery and dividends on shares held by the Minister for Finance in State and other companies. In relation to the 2010 forecast for non-tax revenue, this figure also includes the one-off receipt of €140 million in respect of the winding up of Ulysses securitisation and the transfer to the Exchequer of €1 billion in respect of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3012">Aggregate forecasts for each of the headings above, for the years 2011-2014, are set out in Table 10 on page C.20 of Budget 2010.  Details of the end-2009 outturn for each of these headings will be published by the Department of Finance on 5 January 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_3014">Expenditure receipts, or Appropriations-in Aid, are Departmental receipts which, with the approval of the Dáil, may be retained by a Department or Office to offset expenses instead of being paid into the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.  The forecast of capital receipts set out in Table 10 is based on figures provided by Departments in respect of their Votes.  The bulk of capital receipts forecast for 2010 is accounted for by transfers to the Department of Transport under the Local Government Fund of €429.3 million.  There is also a once off figure in 2010 of €50 million in respect of Asset Disposals by the HSE.   The remaining €56.7 million is largely in respect of expected EU receipts spread over a number of Departments.  Forecasts for future years are indicative and are largely based on the same components, with the exception of the once-off receipts from the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_3016">The Income Levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners as a component of Income Tax.  In Budget 2010, it was forecast that income tax receipts of €11,530 million would be collected in 2010.  The precise breakdown of this target between the individual components of Income Tax will be finalised in the context of preparing the monthly profiles by tax-head.  As is customary, the monthly profiles for the forthcoming year are prepared following an analysis of the end-year outturn of the current year. However, at this stage it is expected that the yield from the income levy will be of the order of €1½ billion in 2010.  Monthly profiles by tax-head will be published in January 2010.</p>

Where the stay-at-home spouse in a married one earner couple cares for a dependent person, e.g. their child or an elderly relative, the couple may benefit from an entitlement to the home carer tax credit, which has a value of €900.  The Commission on Taxation considered the issues associated with tax individualisation in its 2009 report.

The relevant provision states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3143">"Where a credit institution plans to close or move a branch it must inform affected consumers in writing at least 3 months in advance and advise the Financial Regulator immediately thereof.

            <p eId="para_3146">The recommendation for the immediate abolition of Stamp Duty in current economic conditions would see Exchequer receipts fall even further, at a time when it is vital to preserve resources.  While the correspondence forwarded by the Deputy relates to Stamp Duty, it relates primarily to Stamp Duty on property.  It is estimated that Stamp Duty net receipts for 2009 will be in the region of €900m, of which it is expected that residential property will account for €143m and non-residential for €160m.  These estimated figures are based on the yield in the year to date.  Should Stamp Duty be abolished, this loss to the Exchequer would have to be made up elsewhere.  Stamp Duty on property will be reviewed in the context of potential changes to the taxation of property, such as the Commission on Taxation's recommendation to introduce a residential property tax and the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce a Site Valuation Tax on non-agricultural land.</p>

However, I can say that 18 of the individuals concerned were in the Health sector, 3 in the Civil Service, and 4 in other areas of the Public Service.  In almost every case the actual post in question was abolished.  Awards of notional service ranged from just under 1 year to 10 years.</p>

         the underspend of approximately €35 million on energy efficiency schemes in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, his views on the allocation in February 2009 of €75 million for this purpose; if he is satisfied that the system of allocation of grants was sufficiently efficient to ensure the money was spent; the measures he is taking now to address the serious underspend; the discussions he has had with Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources regarding an outturn which shows an underspend of over 50% of capital funding in that Department on energy efficiency measures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3287">The Government decided, in February of this year, as part of a reallocation of funds across Departments  to make an additional €75 million available for labour intensive investment in home insulation and energy efficiency measures. €36.5 million of this additional funding was allocated to the two insulation schemes operated under the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, by Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Warmer Homes Scheme and the Home Energy Savings Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3288">My Department monitors expenditure trends by all Departments and was aware that expenditure on energy efficiency schemes by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was running behind profile during 2009.  This was a matter in the first instance for the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources. I understand that due to the need to set up the appropriate systems and resources in advance of its opening the Home Energy Saving Scheme opened to applications on 25 March 2009 and applicants had six months from the date of acceptance of their application by SEI to complete works and draw down the grant.  This inevitably meant that it was the Autumn before any significant level of drawdown commenced.  I am informed that significant commitments have now been incurred on foot of applications under the Home Energy Saving Scheme and that Minister Ryan is confident that allocations for 2010 for energy efficiency will be spent.</p>
            <p eId="para_3289">The Government attaches high importance to energy efficiency schemes which is why, in my recent Budget, I allocated €90 million for the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in 2010 for a National Energy Efficiency Retrofit Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3294">As I announced in my Budget, mortgage interest tax relief will be extended until 2017 for those who took out a qualifying home loan in 2004 or after.  Tax relief at current rates for the first seven years will be available for qualifying loans taken out up to 1 July 2011 and at a reduced level once the seven years is complete, until 2017.  Transitional tax relief, also at a reduced level, will be available from 1 July 2011 for qualifying loans for the following 18 months up to end 2012.  There will be no relief for interest paid on home loans taken out after that date and the entire scheme will terminate in 2017.  Full details will be provided in the Finance Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_3295">Many of those who purchased homes from 2004 onwards, when house prices were at their peak, may now find themselves in negative equity, depending on the particular circumstances of the purchase.  However, qualification for the extension of mortgage interest tax relief is based on the commencement date of a qualifying home loan and not the equity status of the mortgage holder's home.   Put simply, negative equity will not be a criterion for eligibility for tax relief on the interest payable on qualifying home loans.</p>

The Office of Public Works intends to initiate detailed discussions with the owners of the Kennedy Homestead in Dunganstown and with other key stakeholders, such as Wexford County Council, with a view to developing proposals, which could form either specific works or more general support for the Homestead.  The Office of Public Works would be particularly interested in identifying projects, which could strengthen the link between the Homestead and the nearby JFK Arboretum.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3315">Under the new Bill, there is no specific provision to provide post adoption services. Adopted children have, and will continue to have, the same eligibility and entitlements to health and personal social services and special education needs as any child in Ireland. However, the Bill does make statutory provision for the notification by adoptive parents of the adoption on return to Ireland with a child. This notification must be made both to the Adoption Authority for the purposes of registering the child as well as to the HSE, so that the child receives all of the normal child health surveillance services available through the public health system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3316">As regards information and tracing for adopted persons, again, the Bill does not cover this area as there is already an effective administrative system for dealing with the issue of information and tracing. The Information and Tracing Unit in the Adoption Board provides an advice and referral service for those seeking to trace or to obtain medical or personal information. The National Adoption Contact Preference Register (NACPR) assists adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information, or to state their contact preferences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">In November 2007, the Adoption Board launched the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Adoption Information and Tracing Service" to set standards and provide guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally.  In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, I understand that subject to resources, the Adoption Board intends to undertake a consultation process with interested parties to determine how best to address the information and tracing needs of those who have been adopted from abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">The provisions governing the registration of domestic adoptions and the issue of birth certificates drawn from the register of adoptions are set out in section 22 of the Adoption Act, 1952. Under these provisions, the Registrar General is charged with maintaining an Adopted Children Register and also to keep an index to make traceable the connection between each entry and the corresponding entry in the register of births. The index is not open to public inspection and no information from it may be given to any person except by order of a Court or of the Adoption Board. A certified copy of an entry in the Adopted Children Register, if purporting to be issued under the seal of Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora, shall, without further proof, be received as evidence of the facts stated therein and any requirement of law for the production of a certificate of birth shall be satisfied by the production of such certified copy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">Under the above provisions, birth certificates for adopted persons are available only from the Office of the Registrar General. While it is appreciated that this may cause a degree of inconvenience in certain instances the security and confidentiality of the Adopted Children Register is of paramount importance and it is for this reason only that the restriction on availability exists.  For this reason also, there are no plans to amend the legislation to change the current arrangements in relation to this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_3321">There were 529.31 WTEs employed in my Department at the beginning of 2009. An additional 24.17 WTEs transferred into my Department during the year as a result of the transfer of youth affairs responsibilities from the Department of Education and Science, other functions from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the dissolution of the National Council on Aging and Older People and the Women's Health Council under the rationalisation of agencies programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3322">Even allowing for these additions, the overall number of people employed at the end of November 2009 had fallen by 40.03 WTEs to 489.28 WTEs. This represents an overall decrease of nearly 8% since the start of the year. Staffing levels in my Department over the coming years will be decided in consultation with the Department of Finance and taking account of the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes. Account will also be taken of the outcome of the review of my Department under the Organisational Review Programme (ORP), which is being carried out under the aegis of the Department of An Taoiseach.

            <p eId="para_3339">The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">The current policy position, as set out in the Adoption Bill 2009, is that for an adoption to be registered under the Bill it must be effected in a contracting State to the Hague Convention or in a country with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement. For non-Hague countries only those adoptions effected prior to the commencement of the new law can be registered on the Register of Inter-Country Adoptions to be established under the Bill.  The issue of transitional measures for prospective parents who are at a definable stage in the adoption process when the Bill is enacted and who wish to continue to adopt a child from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, is being examined.  Prospective adoptive parents have waited a long time and it is my intention to be as flexible as possible in relation to applicants.</p>

Planned reductions in ex-factory prices will save €121m in 2010, with knock-on savings of €20m at wholesale and retail level. These savings are in addition to savings of approx €80m in 2010 arising from the terms of the 2006 agreements with the pharmaceutical manufacturers.  It is also my intention to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution under the GMS and community drugs schemes.  This will encourage greater use of cheaper generic alternatives and lead to further savings in the State's drugs bill. The legislation to do this will be introduced during 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_3809">I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 to 139, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3810">The Health Service Executive, with my full support, has decided to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals at its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin.  Applications from people whose income exceeds the income guidelines but have a case to be considered on medical or hardship grounds will also be processed by the PCRS.  The process commenced in January 2009 when the PCRS took over the processing of all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin to the PCRS.  The phased implementation allows the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  The PCRS has processed over 63,000 medical card applications since the start of 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3811">The HSE has advised that the transfer of the case load from the two local health offices included a backlog of some 6,500 cases.  These are being dealt with as a matter of urgency by the PCRS.  As a result, resources which would have been deployed in customer relations and phone answering have been assigned to deal with this backlog.  The HSE is providing additional resources to respond to phone queries, the majority of which relate to the outstanding applications. The HSE has advised my Department that local health offices will continue to deal with queries of a general nature about the medical card scheme and will provide any assistance needed with the application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3812">The HSE has recently put in place a national on-line system to allow local health offices track the current status of applications in the PCRS.  The HSE has indicated that a facility is now available where a person can view the status of their medical card application on-line and if a mobile phone number is supplied with an application, updates by text message will be delivered to the applicant's phone.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure:</p>
            <p eId="para_3813">Improved turnaround time for the processing of applications (A turnaround time of 15 days or less for all medical card applications.  Emergency applications will be dealt with immediately with a card issuing within 24 hours);</p>

            <p eId="para_3815">Consistency of service provision to customers;</p>

            <p eId="para_3818">My Department is currently in discussion with the HSE about putting in place a dedicated telephone number for Oireachtas members for enquiries about applications being processed by the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_3819">In relation to the specific issues raised by the Deputy about the processing of medical card applications and reviews in respect of persons aged 70 or over, such persons are now required to undergo a means assessment.  Under this assessment the person is required to complete a simplified review form, and provide up-to-date evidence of their income.  To date this year, 26,713 reviews in respect of persons aged 70 or over and their dependants have been received in the PCRS.  The HSE has reported the following in relation to these reviews:</p>
            <p eId="para_3820">22,726 (85%) have been completed with eligibility confirmed to the client.</p>
            <p eId="para_3821">Additional information has been requested from 3,194 persons (12%).</p>
            <p eId="para_3822">735 (2.8%) are currently going through the assessment process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3823">58 (0.2%) lost eligibility as their current income is above the income thresholds.</p>
            <p eId="para_3824">85% of the completed reviews, where all the relevant information was supplied, were completed within 20 days, with 95% completed within 30 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_3825">The HSE has indicated that it has no control over delays where relevant information is not provided but it has confirmed that when the required information is received, the review is processed without further delay.</p>

            <p eId="para_3837">The Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the HSE administers the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme (SWA), which includes rent supplement, on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs. In February 2006, the Government decided, inter alia, that the CWS should be transferred to that Department. Provision has been made in the Social Welfare and Pensions Acts 2007 and 2008 for the transfer of the administration of the SWA scheme from the HSE to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. These provisions are subject to a commencement order.</p>
            <p eId="para_3838">On 28 April 2009, the Government considered a report on the progress of the transfer of functions programme. The Government directed that the transfer of the CWS proceed and that the associated industrial relations difficulties be referred to the national IR institutions. In the Renewed Programme for Government October 2009, the Government restated its intention to transfer the Community Welfare Service from the HSE to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3839">There are significant benefits to be achieved in transferring the administration of the SWA from the HSE to the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The Government's priority is to ensure that the transfer is managed in a well-planned and efficient manner, and that a high standard of service to the public is maintained during the transition. The transfer will alleviate pressure on the HSE and facilitate it in concentrating on its core health and personal social service functions. The transfer will not lead to any changes in the exercise of discretion by community welfare officers when dealing with applications for the supplementary welfare allowance. The flexibility and responsiveness which is inherent in the scheme will remain. This flexibility and responsiveness have been very much in evidence in the role community welfare officers have played in providing financial assistance to persons who have been affected by the recent flooding crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3840">A considerable amount of preparatory work for the transfer of the CWS to DSFA has already been completed.  The IT, accommodation and financial management aspects are well advanced. The necessary legislative changes have been made and are subject to a Commencement Order.  I can also report that all of the relevant parties (my Department, the HSE, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, IMPACT and SIPTU) are actively engaged in intensive discussions, which are being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.</p>

The Director of the Coast Guard and the Director of Services for Mayo County Council are currently dealing directly on the matter and will be meeting today 17th of December at the Council offices in the latest effort to move the issue forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_3898">As part of the necessary correction to the public finances, the overall budget for the improvement and maintenance of national, regional and local roads will be reduced by 15% from €1.9 billion in 2009 to €1.6 billion in 2010.  While reduced, €1.6 billion is still a significant investment in this very important sector and has to be considered in the context of the very high levels of funding provided for roads over the last decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_3899">In relation to national roads, I should point out that the funding being provided will allow for the Major Interurban (MIU) routes and the upgrading of the M50 to be completed by end 2010 as envisaged under Transport 21.  In addition, the 2010 funding will allow the National Roads Authority (NRA) to progress some other strategic road projects.  It will, of course, be necessary for the NRA to keep its programme for future years under review in the light of the available public finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3900">With regard to regional and local roads, a programme of works for 2010 has yet to be decided.  The level of grants allocated to individual authorities is determined each year having regard to a number of factors including the total funds available in a particular year, eligibility criteria for the different grant schemes, road pavement conditions, length of road network, the need to prioritise projects and competing demands from other local authorities.  I will be announcing the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations early in the New Year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4077">His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement and all representations received were considered in arriving at a decision in his case. On 28 June 2004 a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the first named person concerned. Notice of this Order was served by registered post dated 11 January 2005. This communication advised the first named person concerned of the legal requirement that he present himself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 20 January 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State. The first named person concerned failed to ‘present' on this occasion and, as such, was classified as evading his deportation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4078">On 14 August 2008, an application for revocation of the Deportation Order, under Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), was submitted on behalf of the first named person concerned. This application is under consideration in my Department at present. When a decision has been made on this application, the first named person concerned will be notified in writing of that decision and of the consequences of the decision.   The second named person concerned was granted refugee status in the State in 2003. This decision was conveyed to the second named person concerned by letter dated 13 June 2003.</p>

Through our Embassy in Kampala, the Government has expressed our deep concerns about the Bill to the Government of Uganda. We have also coordinated closely with our EU partners in order to raise our concerns with the Ugandan authorities as a human rights issue. On 3 December, through the Swedish Presidency, the European Union formally raised its concerns about the draft Bill in a meeting with the State Minister of Foreign Affairs.  Our Embassy in Kampala has also been engaging with the Uganda Human Rights Commission on issues relating to discrimination against sexual minorities. It has also sought the views of local human rights and representative groups on how the international community can most effectively support efforts to oppose such discrimination.</p>

            <p eId="para_4103">The Taoiseach will travel to Copenhagen today to head Ireland's delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in the final days of the negotiations for an ambitious new climate change agreement. Earlier this week, I attended a meeting of EU Development Ministers in Copenhagen in order to underline the importance of the links between climate change and development. We held discussions with Ministers from a number of developing countries, focusing on ways in which the EU can support them in responding to the enormous challenges of climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_4104">The Government and our EU partners recognise that significantly increased financial resources will be required in order to support developing countries as they cope with the impact of climate change. The EU has also stated clearly that climate change financing must not undermine or jeopardise the fight against poverty. At last week's meeting of the European Council in Brussels, it was agreed that the EU and its Member States would contribute €2.4 billion annually in fast-start funding for the three years 2010 to 2012 to support the climate change needs of developing countries. The Taoiseach pledged that Ireland would contribute up to €100 million over this three-year period.</p>

            <p eId="para_4107">EU relations with Colombia are conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In 2007, negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive Association Agreement between the EU and the Andean Community were formally launched. This Agreement will cover all facets of relations between the EU and these countries, including political dialogue, cooperation and trade. In addition, a multiparty free trade agreement is being negotiated between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community — Colombia and Peru — within the overall framework of the Association Agreement. The negotiations are being carried out by the Commission on the basis of a mandate from the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_4108">The negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement with Colombia is part of an EU strategy to support and encourage the Colombian Government as it tries to restore the authority of the State after decades of violent civil conflict. By engaging with Colombia in this way, the EU strongly believes it can influence the Government in a manner that also results in greater respect for human rights.  Ireland fully supports that strategy. We recognise that the promotion of peace and stability in Colombia requires a comprehensive, multi-strand strategy which tackles simultaneously the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict. Our approach and that of the European Union is to engage with the Colombian Government as it emerges from decades of terrorism and to influence that process in a manner that strengthens the Government's commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p>
            <p eId="para_4109">I am aware of and share the deep concern that has been expressed at the manner in which trade union activists, human rights defenders and journalists have been treated in Colombia. Ireland, along with its EU partners, monitors the human rights situation in Colombia and raises issues including such human rights abuses with the Colombian Government through the ongoing EU-Colombia dialogue on human rights and in regular contacts at political level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4110">Last month, during a visit to Colombia to present credentials, Ireland's Ambassador to Mexico raised these issues at meetings with the Colombian Minister for Foreign Affairs and with senior officials in the Foreign Ministry. The Ambassador emphasised the importance that Ireland attaches to the protection of human rights defenders and trade unions leaders and explained the considerable attention that their plight has attracted in Ireland. The Foreign Minister confirmed that this is a priority issue for Colombia and that every effort was being made to address the position in the context of a difficult security situation. In the course of his visit the Ambassador also met with representatives of Irish NGOs to hear at first hand about their concerns regarding human rights and their views in relation to the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4111">I am of the view that continuing the FTA negotiations with Colombia at this time offers the best opportunity to ensure that the concerns of EU Member States at the human rights situation in that country and, in particular, the treatment of trade union activists are fully addressed by the Colombian government<b><i>. </i></b>To this end, Ireland, along with other EU partners will continue to input to the European Commission negotiators to ensure a balanced outcome to the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and one which gives due prominence to the protection of human rights. In addition, I am writing to the EU Trade Commissioner to underline our interest in an effective human rights clause being included in the agreement.</p>

Under Vote 28, €56.4 million is allocated to programmes, which represents a reduction of €12.8 million on the corresponding allocation for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4116">Savings amounting to €9m will accrue from the fact that support for the Referendum Commission will not be required in 2010 and reductions that will emerge on our contributions to International Organisations. Many of these contributions are denominated in dollars and during 2009 savings have already been made on foot of exchange rate gains.  The Emigrant Support Programme to support Irish emigrants overseas and to facilitate extensive Irish-related cultural, business and community projects, will continue next year with a total allocation of just under €13m, a reduction of €2.2 million. This is sustainable without reducing support for frontline organisations assisting the most vulnerable and needy Irish emigrants who will remain the core focus of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4117">Expenditure will be reduced by just over €1 million following the winding-up of the programme of support for the transition of EU applicant countries and the member states that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007. This programme has been very useful in assisting these countries in transition and in developing good relations with countries where we have not had a long-term presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4118">Funding to my Department for Information services is reduced by €500,000 and funding to support cultural relations with other countries is reduced by €45,000.  The grant-in-aid paid to European Movement Ireland and the Irish UN Association is reduced by €76,000. This reflects a reduction of €16,000 or 6.4% in funding of the European Movement Ireland and the discontinuation of funding for the Irish UN Association.  All other programmes on Vote 28 retain their 2009 allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4119">On Vote 29, the proposed allocation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) in 2010 is €536m compared with €571m for 2009. However, ODA as a percentage of Gross National Product (GNP), which is the internationally recognised measure of a donor's ODA programme, has now been stabilised and, based on current projections, will amount to 0.52% of GNP in 2010. Ireland's total allocation to ODA in 2010 is €671 million, including an estimated €135 million from other Government Departments and Ireland's share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_4120">Detailed allocations across the programme have yet to be finalised but will reflect our core objectives of poverty reduction and a focus on results. I expect that we will be providing in excess of €100 million to NGOs and missionaries, over €100 million to fight HIV and AIDS and other communicable diseases and over €50 million for emergencies and assistance to fragile states. We will also ensure our commitments to our nine Programme Countries, seven in Africa and two in Asia are met.</p>

            <p eId="para_4122">Relations between Armenia and Turkey have long been overshadowed by the events which resulted in the tragic deaths of very large numbers of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire more than ninety years ago. Both sides hold sharply different historical interpretations of these events.  More recently, there have been signs of an improvement in this difficult relationship. I welcome the signature by Armenia and Turkey of protocols on 10 October 2009 in which they agreed to establish diplomatic relations and re-open their common border. The protocols must now be ratified in each country, a process that may not be easy given the long history of ill feeling between both countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4123">However, the agreement reached on the protocols has the potential to not only enhance relations between the two countries, but also peace and stability in the wider region. Hopefully, as their relationship moves forward and develops, Armenia and Turkey will also be able to come to terms with their shared past. I understand that, as part of the agreement, it is intended to establish a sub-commission on historical issues.  The Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister visited Dublin on 3 November 2009 and met with Minister of State Roche and officials from my Department. During her visit the Deputy Minister briefed on the Armenia-Turkey protocols. There was also an exchange of views on Ireland's experience of conflict resolution in relation to Northern Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_4136">In his Financial Statement on Budget 2010 made last week, my colleague, Mr Brian Lenihan TD, Minister for Finance, announced that Iarnród Éireann has agreed to participate in a new scheme, to be developed by Fáilte Ireland, as an imaginative initiative to increase tourism numbers next year.  The scheme, which is to be aimed at senior citizens visiting Ireland from abroad, will offer vouchers for greatly discounted rail travel throughout Ireland. The initiative responds to proposals from the tourism industry to extend the current free travel scheme for senior citizens resident in Ireland to British visitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4137">The potential of such an initiative to generate interest in Ireland as a destination was recognised by the Tourism Renewal Group.  Anything that adds value and sends out a message of affordability for potential visitors to the island of Ireland is welcome in the current highly competitive environment.  The Renewal Group's Report recommended that an off-season scheme be piloted, at no additional cost to the Exchequer, to widen access to free public transport for OAP visitors from abroad.  It is in that context that the Minister for Finance made his announcement.  As explained in his Financial Statement, more information on this initiative will be given by Fáilte Ireland and Iarnród Éireann in the coming weeks when the details have been finalised.</p>

            <p eId="para_4199">There is no doubt that the tourism industry as a whole, including the hospitality and catering sectors, has had a very difficult year in 2009.  This Government is committed to maximising the contribution of tourism to economic recovery in 2010.  My Department's Tourism Services Budget for 2010 is over €155m, representing an increase of 2% on 2009.  The increased allocation of public resources — at a time of major fiscal retrenchment — is clear recognition by Government of the important role that the tourism and hospitality sector will play in Ireland's economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_4200">It should be noted that Budget 2010 incorporates a range of measures and initiatives to renew Irish tourism.  Key elements build on actions recommended in the recent Report of the Tourism Renewal Group.  These measures to assist the tourism sector were welcomed by their representative federations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4201">In commenting on these measures the Irish Hotels Federation (IHF), representing hoteliers and guest house operators, welcomed the acknowledgement by Government of the important role of tourism in the economy.  The IHF also welcomed the budget measures introduced including maintaining funding in the level of tourism marketing, a trebling of the allocation for tourism product development, a new voucher scheme to enable discounted travel for senior citizens from abroad and a reduction in excise duty on alcohol products all of which will assist the sector going forward.  The Vintners Federation of Ireland also welcomed the excise duty reductions noting that they should help stimulate growth and jobs not just in the hospitality industry, but across the whole retail sector.</p>

In 2008 and 2009 alone, €52m was paid in respect of such facilities.  A further €16m is provided in the 2010 Estimates for regional arts capital projects.

            <p eId="para_4210">The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism was designated for relocation to Killarney, Co. Kerry, under the Government's Decentralisation Programme, which was announced in the 2004 Budget.  The Department, excluding the National Archives, was designated an "early mover" by the Decentralisation Implementation Group.  To date, 79 members of staff (including two service officers who were recruited locally) have relocated to the new purpose built offices which opened last December in Killarney.  However, the Government moratorium on recruitment and promotion has impacted on the ability of the Department to proceed with further transfers at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_4211">In order to provide an efficient and effective service to its stakeholders including the Minister, Minister of State and the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly when the Dail is in session, 20 posts were identified as requiring a predominantly Dublin presence while officers in those posts also spend periods of time in Killarney.  In addition, extensive use is made of the video-conferencing facilities in the Department and every effort is made to co-ordinate and "cluster" meetings in order to keep the need for travel between the two locations to a minimum.  The property expenditure for the Department's relocation to Killarney under the Decentralisation Programme is a matter for the OPW.  The total non-property expenditure to date for the Decentralisation Programme for the Department is €1.16m.</p>

This provision will ensure that commitments arising in 2010 from previous allocations under the Sports Capital Programme will continue to be met and that a range of modern facilities will be brought in to use in 2010.

            <p eId="para_4218">The National Museum of Ireland is the national repository for all archaeological objects that may be discovered.  The Museum is also charged with the conservation and display of the National Collection of moveable heritage and the expansion and enhancement of that Collection.  As a collecting agency the Museum will always have material in storage.  All archaeological objects found, with no known owner, belong to the State.</p>

Therefore I have no statutory role in relation to the functions of the Museum.  I wish to point out however, that my Department, in collaboration with the Office of Public Works, has enabled the Museum to obtain storage accommodation in Swords, Co. Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_4220">The National Museum of Ireland manages the Designated County Museum scheme.   Designated museum are legally entitled to retain objects on behalf o the State.  Designated museums have to meet strict guidelines in the care of objects.  They employ a full-time professional curator and have the resources and skills to care for objects.  The National Museum will lend objects for display only to designated museums.  All archaeological objects, on loan from the National Museums, remain State property.  Designated museums will accept an archaeological object only if it is of local interest and be used for educational or display purposes.  In general, objects that are primarily of national interest will normally be acquired by the National Museum.</p>

            <p eId="para_4223">One of the stated aims and objectives of the SCP is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities.  Since 2003, at the initiative of this Department and in consultation with DCRGA, it was decided that areas that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by DCRGA, i.e. RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force and CLÁR areas, should be treated as disadvantaged under the SCP.</p>
            <p eId="para_4224">Projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged, or as serving disadvantaged areas, are targeted and prioritised in a number of ways. They are permitted to have a lower level of minimum own funding available (20% for projects in CLÁR areas and 10% for RAPID and Local Drug Task Force areas in comparison with  the normal 30%) towards their project, and they may also receive extra marks during the assessment process.  Successful projects under the SCP in RAPID areas may qualify to receive additional top-up funding of up to 30% of their SCP allocation, payable by DCRGA, in addition to their sports capital allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4225">Through these measures the SCP has invested over €146 million in designated disadvantaged areas.  In turn, top-up arrangements from the D/CGRA in RAPID and CLÁR areas has allowed further allocations of more than €22 million to be made.  No decision has been made on the timing of future rounds of the Programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4235">In the 2010 Budget, the Government decided, as part of its strategy to manage its way through the current severe economic crisis and to return the country to prosperity, to reduce spending on public services by almost €1 billion in 2010 compared with the pre-Budget estimates. To the greatest extent possible, the savings have been sought through efficiencies rather than through reductions in services.</p>
            <p eId="para_4236">In the case of my own Department, gross funding at €415.426m in 2010 is a reduction of 13% relative to the 2009 allocation of €475.701m. Current funding is reduced by 9%, a decrease of €32.1m, and capital funding is reduced by 21%, a decrease of €28.175m.  The breakdown of these reductions is provided in the recently published Budget Estimates volume.

            <p eId="para_4287">The Deputy will be aware of my intention to put revised arrangements for this Scheme in place early in 2010, following a review this year.  Pending full implementation of these new arrangements, the existing Scheme will remain open for applications.  All applications received by my Department have been processed and grant support has been provided to almost 6,400 older people this year.  The total value of grants paid to community groups is over €2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4288">The final allocation for the Scheme for next year will not be settled until the Revised Estimates are published.  However, my intention is that monitored alarms will be made available to all applicants that might apply in 2010 either through the provision of new equipment or enhancing the capacity of community groups to reuse the stock of equipment already in their ownership.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_4290">I assume that the agencies which the Deputy has in mind are Waterways Ireland and the North South Language Body.</p>
            <p eId="para_4291">In Waterways Ireland's case, the busiest times on the waterways are at weekends and during the longer days of the summer, when overtime is required to provide a proper customer service.  During these periods (and indeed during the navigation season as a whole), staff are required to keep the locks manned and the system open.  Overtime is also incurred during the seasonal maintenance programme (e.g. weed cutting), which is weather dependent. In times of emergencies and at times of adverse weather conditions, staff are also required to work beyond their normal working hours in order to protect the infrastructure and minimise the risk to the public. I am assured by Waterways Ireland that it seeks constantly to manage overtime effectively within the constraints of managing an organisation which supports the leisure and tourism industry, with consequent seasonal focus. I might also add that the Body will be required to implement further efficiency savings next year, in addition to those achieved in relation to 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4292">In relation to the Language Body, overtime costs for Foras na Gaeilge reduced from €40,691 in 2008 to €22,252 in 2009 as a result of the implementation of efficiency savings.  I understand that the overtime costs in question relate principally to reception and security at headquarters when the premises are open to the public after normal office hours, business peaks in the Irish language book distribution section and promotional activities outside of office hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_4293">I understand that overtime costs for the Ulster-Scots Agency were significantly reduced from stg£16,884 in 2008 to stg£4,672 in 2009 following the employment of additional staff.  Overtime costs for 2009 relate specifically to peaks in workflow and specific marketing activity, which required additional work at weekends.  The Agency's policy is that overtime must be approved in advance on the basis of a clearly identified need.  I am informed by both agencies of the Language Body that overtime is authorised only when absolutely necessary and that strict monitoring of authorisations will continue in 2010, particularly in the light of further agreed efficiency savings to be achieved in the Body next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_4432">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  Social Welfare legislation provides the Health Service Executive with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority or an approved body where the reasons for that requirement include anti-social behaviour or the interests of good estate management.</p>
            <p eId="para_4433">In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant and tenant behaviour is a matter for the landlord in the first instance.  There are a number of avenues open to landlords in such cases, including the mediation service for landlords and tenants operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda Síochána and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social behaviour.  If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if effected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.  I am satisfied that existing measures in relation to rent supplement are adequate and I have no plans to make any changes to social welfare legislation in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4436">I propose to take Questions Nos. 252 and 255 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4437">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  There are 3,079 recipients of rent supplement in County Mayo.  Information in relation to the number of rent supplement recipients who are on local authority housing lists is not maintained by the Department.  This information is available from the relevant housing authority in Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_4438">The 2009 Supplementary Budget introduced new arrangements for applications for rent supplement. In order to qualify for rent supplement, from the 27 th July 2009, a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement.  A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_4439">In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside).  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support by the relevant housing authority, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.  The aim of this restriction on entitlement to rent supplement and the new working arrangements is to ensure that housing authorities remain the principal agents both for assessing housing need and for meeting the long-term housing needs of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_4440">The Department works closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and regional and national monitoring groups are being set up by that Department to monitor, support and review the working arrangements in place to regulate access to rent supplement.  The working group will facilitate co-operation and dialogue between local authorities and the community welfare service particularly in relation to the operation of the new housing needs assessment arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_4442">The person concerned applied for Disability Allowance on 21 July 2009.  The claim was assessed by a Medical Assessor and she was found to be not medically suitable for Disability Allowance.  The person concerned submitted further medical evidence which was assessed by the Medical Assessor and she was found to be medically suitable for Disability Allowance.  The person has now been awarded Disability Allowance with effect from 22 July 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4443">Her means were at €324.50 per week based on her spouse's employment.  She is therefore entitled to Disability Allowance at a weekly rate of €17.40 (reducing to €3.60 from 6 January 2010) and a child dependent allowance of €26.00 (increasing to €29.80 from 6 January 2010).  Payment will be available for the person to collect at Ballina Post Office on 6 January 2010.  Any arrears due her, less any overlapping payments, will issue to her shortly afterwards.</p>

         asked the

         the regulations and statutory framework, which her Department relies upon, to restrict a person’s ability to collect arrears of payment to which they are legally entitled when due to an oversight or lack of knowledge the person fails to make application on time and might not do so for one year or so after becoming eligible; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4465">The legislative provisions relating to late claims for social welfare benefits are set out in Section 241 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, and in Regulations made under that section. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim, the disqualifications which apply where a late claim is made, and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended.  Since 1997 a number of improvements have been made to the provisions relating to late claims for social welfare payments. For example, prior to 1997 arrears of state pension contributory claims were limited to either three months or six months before the date of claim. Legislation introduced in 1997 extended that period to twelve months with proportional payments for certain periods prior to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_4466">The legislation also provides for payment to be made on foot of late claims in the case of all schemes, other than supplementary welfare allowance, for a period of 6 months prior to the date of claim, provided that there was good cause for the delay in claiming. Changes introduced in 2000 provided for relaxation of the restrictions on backdating late claims under all schemes apart from jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance and for further payment to be made, up to the level of full retrospection if the circumstances would warrant it, where the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department, or illness or a force majeure prevented a person from claiming earlier or, the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_4467">It is generally accepted that there is an obligation on people to claim their social welfare entitlements in time. However, cases will inevitably arise where they fail to do so and the legislative provisions are designed to cater for such situations. I am satisfied that the current provisions strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand the need to exercise supervision and control of claims and, on the other hand, the need for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.</p>

Some 132,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4538">Proper household insulation is absolutely vital in tacking fuel poverty. Initiatives such as the Warmer Homes Scheme, operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have a very valuable role to play in that regard, as does funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to improve the quality of existing local authority housing.  In addition, revenue from the carbon tax will be used to alleviate fuel poverty in the home. In his Budget speech, the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government outlined details of €130 million in funding for insulation, €76 million of which will be ring-fenced for low income families.</p>
            <p eId="para_4539">The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has overarching responsibility for the energy portfolio and has convened an inter-Departmental/AgencyGroup on Affordable Energy to coordinate and drive Government policy in this area. The objective is to ensure shared understanding of the challenges and actions underway and to ensure a fully cohesive strategic approach to delivery of affordable energy initiatives and programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4540">The Inter Departmental/Agency Group has been asked to draw up an Energy Affordability Strategy for consultation early in 2010. This strategy will set out existing and future approaches to addressing energy affordability and will have regard both to the impact of the carbon tax on low income households and the range of supports outlined above in making its recommendations.</p>

            <p eId="para_4551">Like all areas of the Public Service, the Defence organization will be required to operate on a reduced budget for 2010. Within the available resources, I am committed to maintaining the strength of the Defence Forces at a level of 10,000 across all ranks, for which I have secured Government approval in the context of Budget 2010. The Defence Forces will continue to operate across all of the roles assigned by Government. There will be no new, cost-increasing expenditure measures introduced in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4552">The key current <i> </i>expenditure reductions in 2010 will be achieved as follows. Payroll savings of €14m will be achieved by a reduction in Permanent Defence Forces personnel numbers, reduced civilian employee numbers and lower levels of paid training days for the Reserve Defence Forces.  Reductions in the number of Permanent Defence Force personnel deployed overseas to Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina will achieve savings of up to €7m.  Reduced Naval Service patrol days and the optimisation of Air Corps flying hours will deliver savings of €2.2m.  The Coiste an Asgard sail training scheme will be discontinued, resulting in a saving of €0.8m. Additional Appropriations-in-Aid of up to €13m are anticipated, mainly in respect of UN receipts, property sales, cash escorts and military guards. The scheme of full cost recovery for security services will be extended to An Post, the Central Bank and other organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_4553">The 2010 capital expenditure allocation of €16m will be focused on new building works to improve the accommodation and facilities of the Defence Forces. Capital projects will be prioritised within the reduced allocation.  I am satisfied that priority programmes of investment in equipment and infrastructure will be maintained.</p>

As the final payroll for 2009 has yet to issue a small number of reservists will receive gratuities in that payroll.  Gratuities are normally paid in December of each year.  It would not be unusual if a small number of gratuities for 2009 were notified for payment in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4556">The terms and conditions for receipt of gratuities changed for 2008. The improved rates and the conditions for award of gratuities were sanctioned by the Department of Finance. The Reserve Defence Force Representative Association was consulted by my Department when the gratuity structure was being revised and the changes had their broad agreement and support.</p>

            <p eId="para_4778">The primary responsibility for the management of any waste, including costs for removal or disposal, lies with the holder of the waste; the holder of the waste is the natural or legal person in possession of the waste or the producer of the waste. The Waste Management Acts 1996 — 2008 impose a general duty of care on holders of waste.  A person may not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority to deal with any instances of illegal disposal of waste in their functional area and take the appropriate enforcement action.</p>
            <p eId="para_4779">Section 12 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended by section 100 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, requires a landlord of a dwelling to provide receptacles suitable for the storage of refuse outside the dwelling, save where the provision of such receptacles is not within the power or control of the landlord in respect of the dwelling concerned — this could arise for example where it is a function of a management company to provide such a service.  In addition, the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, which prescribe minimum standards for rented accommodation, provide that each house must have access to suitable and adequate pest and vermin-proof refuse storage facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4780">The purpose of these provisions is to ensure that facilities are available to tenants to enable them to store refuse appropriately between collections and not in such a way as to attract pests or vermin or become a hazard or eyesore to the general public. However, the presentation of refuse for collection, the manner in which it is presented and any charges imposed for collection are the responsibility of the tenant, who is the holder of the waste. Any incidents of illegal waste activity should be reported to the relevant local authorities who have significant enforcement powers available to them under the Waste Management Acts, including the power to make bye-laws regarding the presentation and collection of waste.</p>

            <p eId="para_4791">I propose to take Questions Nos. 283, 287, 288 and 302 to 304, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4792">As stated in the reply to Question No. 336 of 15 December 2009, the Renewed Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce charges for domestic water use in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. Accordingly, I will be bringing forward proposals as a priority for the installation of water meters in households, on the basis that households will be allocated a free basic allowance, with charging only for water use in excess of this allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4793">My Department is considering a number of options in relation to both the delivery and financing of the metering programme.  I will bring detailed proposals to Government early in 2010 on the approach to metering of all households on public supplies. Following the installation of water meters, which will take a number of years to complete, households will be charged for water services based on usage. The water charges will be used to fund the delivery of water services to domestic users by the local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4794">Water conservation, which includes the management of water supply systems, active leakage control and mains rehabilitation, has been the focus of a specific sub-programme under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme.   Since 2003, local authorities have spent over €130 million on these services.   Water conservation works will remain a key priority under the next Investment Programme, which will cover the period 2010-2012.  The metering of domestic connections will contribute to greater water conservation by facilitating enhanced network management by local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4795">The Water Services Investment Programme is currently the subject of a Value for Money review, the objective of which is to review the efficiency and effectiveness of the programme investment and delivery, including delivery structures, and to inform the implementation of the next multi-annual rolling programme of the Investment Programme due to commence in 2010.  The European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 prescribe quality standards to be applied and related supervision and enforcement procedures in relation to supplies of drinking water.  The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for the supervision of public water supplies while local authorities are responsible for the supervision of all other water supplies within their functional area.</p>

            <p eId="para_4797">Local authorities operate under the general supervision of the EPA in relation to the performance of their environmental functions. The Agency collects and collates data annually on water related inspections from all 34 local authorities. The most recent figures available are in respect of 2008.  In that year the total number of routine water-related inspections carried out by local authorities was 63,178.  Of these 5,137 (8%) were farm inspections relating to water.  Local authorities will submit their data for inspections carried out during 2009 to the EPA by 31 January 2010 and I understand the Agency will make these figures available in February 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4798">Discussions are ongoing between my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and local authority representatives to rationalise the existing farm inspection arrangements and to put in place a robust regime that benefits both the State and the farmer.  The aim is that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will commence carrying out inspections for the purposes of the Nitrates Regulations early in 2010.

            <p eId="para_5021">The renewed Programme for Government contains a commitment to the introduction of a site valuation tax for non agricultural land. The detailed measures required to give effect to a site valuation tax are a matter for consideration by Government, and will be informed by the ongoing work of, and discussions between, the relevant Government Departments and Agencies, including my Department, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Valuation Office and the Property Registration Authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_5023">I assume the question refers to general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund which will total some €870m in 2010. Local Government Fund general purpose grants are my contribution to meet the difference between the cost to local authorities of providing an acceptable level of day to day services and the income available to them from local sources and from specific grants. These grants are allocated having regard to a range of factors including the overall funding available for the grants, the cost to each local authority of providing its services, the income available to each local authority from local sources and specific grants and the need to ensure that each local authority receives a baseline allocation that will provide financial stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_5024">Local authorities now have access to an additional revenue stream, the €200 non-principal private residence (NPPR) charge, which was not available to them when the 2009 grant allocations were announced. As of 14 December, €53,586,540 has been collected in 2009, all of which, less transaction and administrative costs, accrues to local authorities.  The 2010 general purpose grant allocation in respect of each local authority is set out in the table below.</p>

            <p eId="para_5390">In the case of the capital programme for Water Services Investment to reduction has been applied and projects delivering key environmental and economic objectives will continue to be prioritised. In the case of social housing provision while the capital provision is reduced, significant restructuring of delivery mechanisms is being implemented involving more extensive use of leasing of units to ensure that overall housing output is maintained at a high level. In other instances where savings are effected it will be necessary to re-profile works over a longer period with the most urgent works being prioritised.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_5392">A number of economic studies carried out over the past few years, rather than a single cost-benefit analysis, provide the economic rationale for the provision of social housing through mechanisms such as the leasing and renting of privately owned accommodation. These studies include the Interim Value for Money and Policy Review of the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), which is due to be published shortly. A further Value for Money and Policy Review will commence shortly which will provide additional information on and quantification of the economic and social benefits from the leasing of properties to meet housing need. The objective of my Department is to maximise the delivery of social housing to cater for the greatest level of need at good value. The leasing initiative offers one of the most effective and efficient responses in terms of meeting this objective, which takes account of the availability of resources, market conditions and also provides for a greater level of flexibility than the traditional methods of social housing provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_5393">While the State will not necessarily gain an asset through the leasing arrangements there are a number of factors which ensure that leasing is good value in the long term for the State.  One of the biggest factors affecting cost to the State in terms of local authority owned dwellings is management and maintenance.  While management and maintenance for the first 10 to 20 years on a new dwelling is relatively low, thereafter the dwelling can require major renovation or upgrading, resulting in a substantial capital cost to both local authorities and my Department.   In leasing, it is proposed, firstly, that the responsibility for structural matters would remain with the property owner and not the local authority.  Secondly, even taking this into account, it is not intended that lease agreements would be for durations longer than 20 years. Therefore the longer term costs to the State associated with traditional social housing delivery mechanisms should not accrue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5394">It must also be recognised that, while under the traditional supply mechanisms of construction and acquisition, the State gains an asset, the economic value of this asset to the State is limited to the extent that properties are purchased by tenants at subsidised rates.   It should, of course, also be noted that in the current environment and having regard to the number of households in need of social housing support, the Social Housing Leasing Initiative offers the opportunity to house significantly more households than would otherwise be possible by relying solely on construction and acquisition programmes.</p>

I intend to increase the national provision for this scheme to €40 million in 2010 and allocations will be notified to local authorities as early as possible next year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5438">The Government's key priorities in shaping the overall housing provision for next year have been to focus the impact of necessary adjustments on the areas in which there is scope to maintain output through more flexible approaches and where the policy context supports such approaches, and to continue to direct available capital resources substantially towards the most vulnerable and disadvantaged.  In keeping with this strategy, the reform programme, now well under way in my Department, involves a shift away from construction/acquisition and a one size fits all approach to meeting social housing needs towards a more graduated system of supports.  This refocusing, in policy and financial terms, is rooted in the clearly articulated rationale set out in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5439">While the provision for the main local authority programme has been adjusted downwards for 2010, I anticipate that, through more flexible market based delivery mechanisms such as the rental accommodation scheme and long term leasing, as well as the significant increase in funding available under the capital assistance scheme in 2010, delivery across the range of social housing measures next year will be of the order of 8,000/9,000 units.</p>

            <p eId="para_5471">The Warmer Homes Scheme, for which funding is being provided in 2010, supports energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty.  The Scheme is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  SEI provides funding directly to local Community Based Organisations (CBOs) for the delivery of the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) to a set number of homes in their respective areas of coverage.  Therefore, unlike other SEI grant schemes, the Warmer Homes Scheme does not provide funding directly to individuals that are eligible for the scheme.  Eligibility is determined on the basis that the home requires the works, is privately owned and the homeowner is in receipt of the Fuel Allowance, invalidity or disability benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5472">SEI informs me that a total of 1,491 households in County Waterford had services provided to them under the Warmer Homes Scheme in 2009.  It is not possible to state what level of funding represents but this figure is approximately 10% of the total number of homes across the country that have benefitted from the Scheme in 2009.  Some €20 million was provided to the WHS in 2009.  This represents a very substantial increase on previous years and the WHS is supporting energy efficiency interventions in 15,000 low income homes this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5482">Achieving efficiencies in Commercial Semi-State companies under the remit of my Department is in the first instance a day-to-day matter for the companies themselves in the context the regulatory and market conditions under which they operate.  As regards pay I would refer the Deputy to the statement by the Minister for Finance has stated in the Dáil debate on the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill, 2009 that he does not control the pay of staff of these bodies.  They have not been covered by the public service element of pay rounds in the past and have taken an independent approach to controlling their pay bills, as happened in RTE, where voluntary reductions were agreed by the staff, or in the ESB, where there have been a number of voluntary redundancy schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5483">While these companies must be allowed to act commercially and in accordance with the normal industrial relations process, the Government is of the view that pay restraint in these companies fulfils a long-term national interest namely, ensuring competitive pricing for energy and other goods. However, the market and the regulators will impose such discipline on those bodies.  Non-commercial State Bodies under the remit of my Department, funded by the Exchequer, will be subject to the general public sector expenditure discipline, which will drive efficiencies and will also be subject to pay cuts as set out in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill, 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_5488">The Government is committed to the sustainable development of the Irish biofuels market in line with overall EU biofuel sustainability criteria and the target of 10% for renewable energy in transport by 2020.  To date, the production of biofuel in Ireland has been incentivised under the Mineral Oil Tax Relief Schemes, which have resulted in 18 projects being awarded excise relief on specified volumes of biofuel they produce.  A total of 49% of the biofuel available in Ireland under the MOTR Scheme II is imported.  The market penetration rate for biofuels as a percentage of road transport fuels was 1.6% in 2008.  The schemes were designed as an interim measure to increase the level of biofuels in the fuel mix and to encourage the development of an indigenous biofuels industry in advance of the introduction of the National Biofuel Obligation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5489">The introduction of the National Biofuel Obligation in Mid 2010 will underpin the development of the Irish biofuels market.  The Obligation will also integrate the EU Commission's guidelines on Sustainability Criteria as soon as these are finalised.  The trading of certificates under the Scheme, will also act as an incentive for Irish producers.  For each litre of biofuel sold in the market a certificate will be issued by the National Oil Reserves Agency as the Administrator of the scheme.  Certificates will also be subject to verification by sellers to demonstrate that they meet the sustainability criteria.  Biofuel obligation certificates may be traded among registered operators.  I am confident tradeability of these certificates will enable small indigenous producers, in particular, to enter the market and develop their businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_5490">Under the Obligation fuel suppliers will be compelled to include 4% biofuels in their overall annual fuel sales.  The Obligation will, through the creation of a guaranteed market demand, provide the Irish biofuels sector with the certainty it needs to underpin investment and sustainable growth.  The National Obligation will incentivise and enable the sustainable growth of the Irish biofuels market and support indigenous biofuel producers.  The EU sustainability criteria will also provide some competitive advantage by ensuring that non-EU imports meet strict environmental guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_5491">Growth in indigenous biofuels production will have a positive impact on the Irish economy and security of energy supply and sustainability by displacing both imported fossil fuels and imported biofuels.  Increased production will be progressive over time and a degree of importations will continue. The National Obligation will ensure that Irish producers are given every opportunity to ramp up sustainable indigenous production of biofuels.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5493">As the Deputy is aware the Inland Fisheries Bill 2009 which provides for the restructuring of the management of the inland fisheries sector is currently before the House. The Bill provides for the establishment of Inland Fisheries Ireland, a single authority which will replace the existing Central Fisheries Board and seven Regional Fisheries Boards.  The angling community has always played an important role in the conservation and development of our national inland fisheries resource and I do not foresee that this will change with the transition to the new structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_5494">As I have previously maintained, the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland should be small and contain a strong focus relevant to its business and to the general issue of good corporate governance. I believe the provisions of the Bill, which provide for a board of nine members, achieves this. The Bill provides that potential appointees to the board must have had experience of or have shown capacity in one or more of a number of areas including, inter alia, recreational fisheries.  It is my intention that members appointed to the board will have the necessary expertise and competencies to lead Inland Fisheries Ireland to fully deliver on its potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_5495">Additionally, in recognition of the need for and the value of stakeholder, including angler, participation in inland fisheries, provision has been made in the Bill for the establishment of a national inland fisheries forum. It is envisaged that this will facilitate input by local stakeholders into the work of Inland Fisheries Ireland. I also expect Inland Fisheries Ireland to establish effective communication channels to give local interests an opportunity to influence policies and how they are implemented at a local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_5497">Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles which are crucial to the development of the market including (i) competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment (ii) investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure, (iii) investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide to address market failures and (iv) appropriate regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5498">The OECD report is the most recent in a series of periodic reports on electronic communications markets.  The broadband market is a fast moving and dynamic one; this applies to all OECD countries. On this basis annual comparisons of broadband metrics between different countries cannot capture the full extent of market developments. For example the OECD report excludes improved penetration achieved using mobile technologies in calculating the ratings. Ireland has some 400,000 mobile broadband subscribers, an increase of 53.3% over the last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5499">The OECD and other recent reports demonstrate that broadband access in Ireland is increasing year on year for domestic and commercial users using standard or bundled products offered by a variety of service providers across a range of fixed and wireless technologies which are capable of delivering the needs of today's applications. Major enterprises already located in, or who wish to locate in Ireland can also contract with service providers who can provide high broadband speeds wherever required.</p>
            <p eId="para_5500">I recognise the need to improve availability and quality of broadband in Ireland.  I am satisfied that previous and current initiatives (including the National Broadband Scheme), along with a further measure being developed as part of the European Economic Recovery Plan, will address the broadband availability issue.  Additionally, I am determined to ensure that targeted Government action, the proper regulatory regime and a spirit of competitive collaboration within industry will address the broadband quality issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_5505">The Government recently approved the implementation of a postcode as recommended by the National Postcode Project Board.  This Board was established to recommend the most appropriate postcode system for Ireland and to look at the costs and benefits and implementation of postcodes.  The model recommended, and approved by Government, is an alpha-numeric, publicly available and accessible postcode model.  Each postcode would have a geo-coordinate at its centre and consequently would be compatible with global positioning or navigation systems.  In arriving at this model, the technical and economic consultants who assisted the Board, engaged in a series of stakeholder consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5506">As regards costs, the National Postcodes Project Board's report in 2006 estimated up-front costs of establishing a postcode address database, implementing and promoting the postcode would be in the region of €15m.  The Board was assisted in its work by technical and economic consultants, recruited and funded in 2005 by ComReg, at a cost of approximately €479,000.  Following a Government decision in May 2007, consultants were asked to review and quantify the public sector benefits of introducing postcodes.  This analysis incurred fees of €54,450 and in its assessment, incorporated similar costs for the postcodes project as the National Postcodes Project Board.  The relevant reports are available on my Department's website at <i>www.dcenr.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_5507">The benefits that postcodes will reach much wider than the postal sector, and while An Post did not request the introduction of postcodes, it has said it will in principle fully co-operate with their implementation.  I do not propose to comment specifically an An Post's geodirectory as a product per se, but in so far as the Deputy asks about it being an alternative to the introduction postcodes, it should be noted that the geodirectory is not a publicly available postcode system and is a commercial, proprietary, address database, thus failing one of the criteria for a public postcode.</p>

            <p eId="para_5514">Of the additional €75 million provided in 2009 for labour intensive investment in home insulation and energy efficiency measures, €20 million was allocated to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for investment in social housing energy efficiency.  €55 million was allocated to a number of energy efficiency schemes administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), namely the Home Energy Saving Scheme, Warmer Homes Scheme and a new Scheme of Supports for Exemplar Energy Efficiency Projects (SEEEP) for the business and public sectors.  Subsequent to the additional allocations to these schemes my Department contributed to the capital savings required of all Departments, which resulted in some reduction in the allocations in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_5515">SEI drew down most of the funds allocated for the Warmer Homes and SEEEP Schemes.  The Home Energy Saving Scheme was launched at the end of March 2009 and by the end of the year SEI will have made grant offers to householders totalling over €45 million, some 96% of the allocated funding.  The scheme has already proven successful, with 34,000 households currently approved in the first nine months.  Approved applicants have six months in which to undertake the works and draw down the grant.  The time lag between grant offer and spend meant that it was autumn before a significant level of drawdown commenced.  The level of commitments in place and the ongoing level of new applications being received point to a very significant spend under the scheme in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5516">Of the €130 million allocated for energy efficiency investments in 2010, some €90 million approximately relates to schemes operated by SEI on behalf of my Department.  The level of commitments under the Home Energy Saving Scheme, the high interest in the scheme and the planned expansion of other energy efficiency schemes, should assist drawdown of the allocation for 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_5544">The position is that my Department, in the context of delivering the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), the Disadvantaged Areas Compensatory Allowance Scheme (DAS) and the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), is required to carry out on-the-spot inspections on a number of farms covering such issues as eligibility under the schemes, and compliance with the cross-compliance regime. In 2009 some 130,000 farmers applied for the SPS, over 100,000 of these are also applicants under the DAS and approximately 60,000 are applicants under REPS. The value of these schemes to Irish farmers is some €1.9bn.</p>
            <p eId="para_5545">Each year a minimum of 5% of scheme applicants must be inspected for eligibility. These checks are carried out to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area held by the farmer and to ensure that there are no overlapping or duplicate claims.  Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out without a farm visit and using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_5546">The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance, including Nitrates, is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements or Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition apply. However at least 5% of farmers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations while 3% of sheep farmers must be inspected.</p>
            <p eId="para_5547">The on-the-spot inspections for eligibility and cross-compliance are integrated to the greatest extent possible with a view to ensuring that there is only one visit to the farm.  In 2009 some 1,430 farms were selected for inspection under full cross compliance including nitrates and the total number of on-farm visits was in the region of 8,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_5549">Under Council Regulation 21/2004 as amended the implementation date for the mandatory introduction of electronic tagging (EID) of sheep is definitively set at 31 December 2009.  I have no discretion in this regard.  I have consistently sought the introduction of EID on a voluntary basis and most recently at the Agriculture Council on 20 November 2009. Regretfully, there is not sufficient support among other Member States or from the European Commission for any further changes in relation to the date for the mandatory introduction of EID. The prevailing view at EU level is that Member States should proceed with implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5550">It is my intention to minimise costs for producers by availing of a "slaughter derogation" which allows for the vast majority of Irish sheep to be excluded from the EID requirement.  Only those animals retained for breeding and live exports over the coming years will have to be electronically tagged and so the additional costs to farmers in any given year are being kept to a minimum.  Farmers will not be required to purchase readers since, as is the case at present, an ear tag will continue to have a number on it that is readable to the human eye so there will be minimal change to current practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_5551">The necessary changes to the National Sheep Identification System (NSIS) arising from the introduction of EID will be implemented during the course of next year. My Department will shortly circulate to farm organizations and other stakeholders for comments a technical document outlining the proposed changes to the National Sheep Identification System (NSIS II).  I would urge the stakeholders to examine this document carefully and engage with my officials so that whatever revisions are made to the NSIS best suit Irish conditions and minimise the burden on farmers.</p>

The reduction in the net provision is accounted for under several expenditure subheads as published in the Budget. The main changes compared to 2009 are as follows (figures in brackets are the 2010 allocation and % reduction on 2009 as published in the Estimate for the Department).</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_5572">(€186.3m; – 26%): The reduction is due to the fact that the 2009 Vote provided €165m for expenditure arising under the pigmeat recall scheme for which a corresponding allocation is not required in 2010.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_5574">(€330m; – 11%): While the allocation for the scheme as published in the Budget Day Estimate appears to have reduced, in fact the provision in 2010 is the same as the original Revised Estimate in 2009. The reduction reflects the fact that an additional €39 million was provided for the Scheme in 2009 through the Supplementary Estimate.</p>

The reduction reflects the fact that expenditure under the Farm Waste Management Scheme which would otherwise have fallen into 2010 was approved for payment in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_5624">While the EU Hygiene Regulations introduced in January 2006 includes a derogation for direct sales at local level for primary producers, it also provides that a Member State may introduce a national measure to prohibit or restrict the placing on the market within its own territory of raw milk or raw cream intended for direct human consumption.  It is a well-documented fact that raw milk is a vehicle for the transmission of several pathogens including E.ColiO157: H7 and Mycobacterium bovis. These two examples alone pose a serious risk to public health particularly in the very young and the aged.</p>
            <p eId="para_5625">The Scientific Committee of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in its report "Zoonotic Tuberculosis and Food Safety" identified the consumption of unpasteurised cows or goats milk on the farm as representing a hazard to humans not only in relation to M.bovis but also in relation to other pathogenic bacteria. The report recommended that all milk should be pasteurised prior to consumption and that those who wish to consume milk produced on their own farm should use small-scale domestic pasteurisation units to reduce the risk of milk borne infection with M.bovis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5626">A public consultation process was undertaken last year and resulted in the receipt of submissions from interested parties relating to the proposal to extend the ban on the sale of raw cows milk to milk from sheep and goats. Following examination of these submissions by my Department's experts it was decided, with the agreement and support of the FSAI, that the consumption of unpasteurised milk is an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to public health and that a ban on the sale or supply of unpasteurised milk from all species should be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_5627">The draft legal instrument to introduce this ban is at an advanced stage.  Officials from my Department have been in consultation with the Department of Health and Children with a view to implementing the ban by means of a Statutory Instrument under the Health Act of 1947 (as amended).  Introducing the proposed ban will involve notifying the EU Commission as required by EU Directive 98/34, which deals with the provision of information regarding technical standards and regulations. This process will commence shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_5631">The<b>Common Fisheries Policy</b> (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union which was first put in place in 1983 and has been subject to reviews every 10 years, the most recent was in 2002 and the next is formally scheduled for 2012.  I welcome the Commission’s Green Paper on the reform of the CFP and acknowledge the importance of the process we are embarking on, as it will culminate in the shaping of the strategic blueprint for the European fishing industry for the next decade.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5632">On 21 April 2009 The European Commission published a Green Paper on the latest reform of the CFP in order to launch a consultation with Member States and stakeholders and to initiate a broad public debate on the future CFP reform.  An exchange of views on the Green Paper took place at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on the 25th May 2009.  A further informal discussion was engaged in at the recent November Agriculture and Fisheries Council so this is very much an ongoing process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5633">Back in May, Minister Killeen appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to oversee consultations with Irish stakeholders on the reform of the CFP.  Advertisements were placed in national and relevant fishing newspapers seeking submissions from interested parties for review by Dr. Cawley.  Minister Killeen, Dr. Cawley and my Department have been involved in a series of consultations with various fishing organisations around the country over the last few months in an effort to formulate Ireland's national position.</p>
            <p eId="para_5634">The Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) have pursued its own process to develop its position on the matter, and the result of their deliberations will also feed into Dr. Cawley's work programme and the formulation of Ireland's position.  All of the submissions received by Dr. Noel Cawley are now being evaluated in order to compile a detailed and informed submission to the EU Commission very early in the New Year.  This submission to the European Commission will be published on the Department website for information once it has been finalised and agreed.  Under the planned EU timetable for the review, a summary of the consultation process will be published in 2010.  It will be followed by a legislative proposal to the Council and the European Parliament to be adopted in 2011, with a view to its entering into force in 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_5648">Since the conclusion in November 2008 of the Ombudsman's investigation into the complaint made by a Donegal family whose application under the Lost at Sea Scheme was refused, my Department has been engaged in correspondence with the Ombudsman in relation to her findings in this case and the proposal to award financial compensation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5649">I and my Department have consistently taken the view that this scheme was properly and fairly administered by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources which had responsibility for the scheme at the time, and accordingly that there is no basis for compensation in the amount proposed or any amount.  In coming to this view, as a matter of course I took legal advice, which was considered and acted upon.  At this stage it is impossible to precisely estimate the financial outlay or potential liability that might be involved if the recommendation of the Ombudsman were acceded to.</p>
            <p eId="para_5650">It is important to note that the Lost at Sea Scheme provided for replacement capacity to be awarded (in the form of gross tons and kilowatts), equivalent to that of the lost vessel, that would otherwise have had to be purchased on the tonnage market.  No monetary compensation was provided, the applicant had to have provided a replacement vessel from their own resources, the capacity awarded could not be sold on or otherwise traded, and it could only be used by the applicant or an immediate family member in order to carry on a family tradition in sea fishing.</p>

            <p eId="para_5652">It is estimated that the allocation for forestry in the 2010 Budget will fund planting in the region of 7,000 hectares next year.

The higher level of planting envisaged is evidence of the Government's continued commitment to forestry.</p>

Another function of the NCSE is to disseminate to schools and parents, and such other persons as the NCSE considers appropriate, information relating to best practice concerning the education of children with special educational needs.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_5704">My Department's policy is to support the inclusive education of students with special educational needs across the schools system. In this context, a range of supports are provided to schools to enable them to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports available include additional teaching support, special needs assistant support, school transport and grants for the purchase of teaching materials and specialised equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5705">The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports. All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  The school in question currently has the support of two learning support/resource teaching (LS/RT) posts and one resource teacher post to cater for children with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5706">As the Deputy may be aware, the school in question is among a number of schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among its pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools).  The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through my Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5707">A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification  procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006.  There was an application for review received from the school in question. The school was unsuccessful in that process. However, in recognition of the circumstances faced by the school and to enable it avail of the Home  School Community Liaison (HSCL) service an additional allocation of support has been provided to the school as an exceptional measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_5708">The main focus of Social Inclusion measures is to retain resources in schools participating in DEIS, as there is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.  This approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which  recommended that my Department focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5709">My Department is currently preparing for the next identification process to select schools for inclusion in DEIS.  A comprehensive consultation process to include relevant education stakeholders will be put in place to ensure that the identification process meets the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.  It is not yet possible to determine when the process will be complete.</p>

            <p eId="para_5718">The levels of standard capitation will remain unchanged as a result of the recent budget. The capitation rate at primary level will be €200 per pupil, while at second level the rate will remain at €345 per pupil.  I have consistently said that it is my intention to streamline and rationalise the different grant schemes that provide funding to primary and post-primary schools, both for ease of administration and to ensure that school management has greater autonomy over the funding provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_5719">Therefore, capitation funding provided for general running costs, and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities. In due course, both grant schemes will be merged. In the interim, both grants will continue to be paid according to existing timelines and calculated separately as heretofore.  My officials will be consulting with the management bodies to consider the details of how additional funding, being provided as a result of the recent budget, for books and curricular activities can be channelled to schools having regard to the desirability of streamlining grant payments. Schools will be advised of the arrangements following this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_5721">The 2010 Budget provides €26 million to meet the cost of employing extra teachers in our schools in 2010 in line with commitments agreed in the Renewed Programme for Government.  Some €12m is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide 500 extra teachers over the next three years. This allocation will allow for the employment of an extra 200 teachers starting early 2010 and a further 150 teachers starting in September 2010.  Some €14m is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide extra teachers from September 2010 for the 2010/11 school year to meet demographic pressures and to ensure no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio. This allocation will fund 600 posts in primary schools and 330 posts in post-primary schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_5723">The level of student intake to the Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of, and demand for primary teachers.  The post graduate course was introduced as a response to a shortage in the supply of primary teachers. It was first provided in the 1995/96 academic year and has been repeated almost each year since then.  The course has not as yet been incorporated as a permanent feature of primary teacher training. The decision to provide further courses is generally made on an annual basis depending on the teacher supply situation. Intake to the two most recent such courses was at a record high of 490 students. On the course commencing February 2010 there will be 200 places.</p>
            <p eId="para_5724">The intake into the Colleges of Education in future years will continue to be kept under review by my Department to ensure that there is an adequate supply of teachers.  The number of places on both the Bachelor of Education and Post Graduate courses in recent years are detailed in the table.</p>

My Department is currently considering a number of broad policy issues relating to the recognition process for second level schools and the application from Educate Together to be recognised as a patron body at second level is being fully examined within the context of legal, financial and other factors that I must consider.  In view of the range of issues involved, it has not been possible to bring this matter to a conclusion as quickly as I would have liked.

            <p eId="para_5755">I have repeatedly stated my, and the Government's, commitment to supporting Protestant education. Indeed, it is in order to deal with the concerns expressed by some members of the Protestant community of the effect of the budgetary changes on Protestant schools that I have sought to ensure the direct engagement with those involved in Protestant education in identifying and resolving issues collaboratively.  I have had meetings with a number of groups on this issue.  The most recent such meeting was on 21 October when I met with the Committee on Management for Protestant Schools.  I extended an invitation to that committee to join a working group with my officials to identify particular measures to support the schools and consider options that might deal with their needs.  Regrettably the committee declined my invitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5756">My officials and representatives of the Bishops have remained in touch in an effort to achieve progress on the issues involved. An arrangement is now in place to provide information that can assist my officials in their work on identifying measures aimed at sustaining schools in the Protestant sector.  I retain the belief that engagement between representatives from the Protestant education sector and my officials is the best way to resolve the issues that are of concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_5758">The decision on eligibility for a higher education grant is a matter for the relevant awarding body, a local authority or VEC, as appropriate. The means test for a grant application is normally based on income in the last full financial year. Therefore, eligibility for a student grant for the academic year 2009/10 will be assessed on income from the 2008 financial year.  However, if there has been a change of circumstances at any time during the  period 1st of January 2009 to the last term  of the 2009/10 academic year, which may affect their reckonable income, that is likely to be permanent, then eligibility for the grant may be assessed to reflect those changed circumstances. For example, where a dependent student's parent experiences a permanent change in income level, for example, through a reduction in working hours or unemployment, then they can apply to their local authority or VEC to have their eligibility for a grant assessed on the basis of the new income level.</p>
            <p eId="para_5759">If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant awarding body.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant awarding body and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_5760">Apart from the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the Student Assistance Fund. The objective of the Fund, is to assist students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise, due to their financial circumstances, be unable to continue their third level studies. Information on the Fund is available from the Access Officer at the candidate's College.</p>

            <p eId="para_5763">For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or guardians, dependent mature students or as independent mature students. An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents from the October preceding entry to an approved course.  When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the schemes specify that parental income must be taken into account. Independent mature students, on the other hand, are assessed without reference to their parents' income. The reckonable income of an independent mature student is that of the candidate only and of his or her spouse where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_5764">In order to establish a candidate's status as an independent mature student, documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's address from 1st October of the year preceding entry to college. In considering whether a mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_5765">The documentary evidence normally required by a local authority or VEC to establish independent residence includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or ESB bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department. In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary proofs. While an affidavit, if accompanied by other supporting documentation, may be considered as evidence of independent living, an affidavit in isolation is not considered acceptable as sole proof of residency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5766">Apart from the maintenance grants scheme and the free fees initiative, financial support is also available to students, in approved third level institutions, through the Student Assistance Fund.

            <p eId="para_5773">I am aware of reports of an increase in the number of first class honours degrees awarded in Irish higher education institutions and the HEA has confirmed that the proportion of students graduating with first class honours degrees has increased in recent years. However, I am not aware of any direct evidence to suggest that the number of such awards is too high or is unjustified. Universities and Institutes of Technology have primary responsibility for learner assessment. Their systems of assessment, classification and quality assurance incorporate external reviews through external examiners, who review the grading and classification of examination papers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5774">Learner assessment must be considered in the context of wider qualifications and quality assurance systems. Qualifications included on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) are based on defined learning outcomes and the vast bulk of higher education awards are included on the NFQ. Internal quality assurance procedures in universities and institutes of technology are  reinforced by external review. In the case of universities, responsibility for external quality assurance rests with the Irish Universities Quality Board. In the institutes of technology, HETAC agrees and reviews quality assurance arrangements. The NQAI acts as the external quality assurance agency for the Dublin Institute of Technology. HETAC has also established procedures for the  assessment of learners which are fair and consistent.</p>
            <p eId="para_5775">Responsibility for the external quality assurance review of universities and institutes of technology will move to an amalgamated body, which will have responsibility for qualifications, including the maintenance and development of the NFQ, and quality assurance. This single body will be well placed to consider issues relating to learner assessment. As the Deputy will be aware I have established a high level Strategy Group to consider the higher education sector in its entirety and to develop a vision for its future direction. The issues of quality assurance and the awarding of qualifications will also be considered in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_5785">Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works are now available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. Details of the dates when applications from schools in Co. Offaly were received are in the attached table. The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department's website. The progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme. However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of projects at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_5896">I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS. NEPS in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for  individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_5897">The introduction of the General Allocation model for primary schools in 2005/06 means that children with high incidence special needs can get access to extra support without having to undergo an individual assessment. Children who manifest very special or urgent needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the Principal teacher will usually be assessed by the psychologist within that school term. Normally, principals of schools prioritise those children in need of psychological assessment in consultation with the assigned psychologist. Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing I would suggest that they contact the relevant local NEPS Regional Director (in this instance NEPS Southern Regional Office, Tel: 021- 4536358) to discuss the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_5899">The supply teacher scheme was initially set up at primary level over 15 years ago at a time when schools had difficulty getting substitute teachers. The supply scheme operates on the basis of an additional full-time teacher being allocated to a school to cover certified sick leave absences in that school and a cluster of neighbouring schools. If the teacher is not required on a given day to cover sick leave absences they generally assist with other work in their school such as administrative duties. There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5900">A value for money review was published in July 2006. The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers' time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties. This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences. While there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers it is considered more cost effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers "on call" all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.  The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year. The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.</p>
