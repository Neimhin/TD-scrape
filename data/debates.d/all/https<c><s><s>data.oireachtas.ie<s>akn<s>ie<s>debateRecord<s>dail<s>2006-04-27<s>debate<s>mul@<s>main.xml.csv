#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the urgent need to assist St. Paul's College, Raheny in its request for more resources and finance to deal with: the high insurance costs; the capitation grants and its inadequate contribution to school finance; the inadequate special needs services, such as delays in having children assessed and the lack of facilities for these children in terms of learning support; and to give St. Paul's College the maximum support on these important issues.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the number of people being refused medical cards or having them removed at a time when the Government is claiming to provide additional cards or at least doctor only cards. Each application has to be scrutinised by many different people who must justify their existence instead of leaving the decision regarding cards to the community welfare officers who interview the clients and in many cases know the unique situation of each individual or family over many years. Would the money spent on increased administration not be better utilised on the provision of medical cards to those in need especially in cases like cancer etc. where families are in trauma?

#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the failure of the Minister for Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to provide 24-hour ambulance cover to the people of Scariff and all of east Clare. In this area, people's lives are endangered when they are left without rapid response ambulance cover which is crucial in emergencies.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the need to stop the cutbacks in the home help services; the need to extend these services; the need to significantly increase the nursing home subvention payment; the need to provide additional public funds for the elderly and in this regard to provide funding to renovate St. Michael's ward, St. Patrick's Hospital, Cashel, thereby providing 30 additional beds for the elderly at a minimal cost of €1 million; and to ask the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the matter.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Having considered the matters raised, they are not in order under Standing Order 31.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	It is proposed to take No. 17, Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006 — Second Stage, resumed; No. 16, Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006 — Second Stage, resumed; and No. 18, National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006 — Second Stage, resumed.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Dáil, on rising today, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 May 2006.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I have one proposal to put to the House. Is the proposal that the Dáil on rising today, shall adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 May 2006 agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Why is the House not sitting on Tuesday?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It is hardly worth making a major issue out of losing one day. However, with 62 Bills promised for 2007, I take it that this indicates we will have a shorter summer recess and therefore we will not oppose this proposal.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I understand that it is a bank holiday weekend. The suggestion was that the House returns on Wednesday, with the agreement of Members. On the legislative programme, we have a very good legislative programme for the coming session and I hope, with the co-operation of everyone, we will have a good outcome from the debate that will take place.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Is the proposal agreed? Agreed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Following on what the Minister for Finance said, on the last occasion between Christmas and Easter the Government only published 50% of its list of proposed legislation. As we now approach the summer season with 400,000 provisional drivers on the roads, 120,000 of whom are waiting for driving tests, will we see the road traffic Bill in the next ten weeks, dealing with outsourcing of driving tests because young drivers are paying €23 million extra on insurance premia and so on? Is the Minister in a position to tell the House that the road traffic Bill will be published and debated in the House during this session?In view of the fact that there is clearly a difficulty under the Education Act with the CBS decision on St. Michael's school in Inchicore, where following the demolition of those flats new apartments will be built there in a few years leading to a necessity for school buildings and facilities, will the Minister for Finance request the Minister for Education and Science to intercede with the CBS and the community to ensure provision of education for the children of that area now and in future?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The Deputy should address a question directly to the Minister for Education and Science on that matter. The Minister may reply to the first question.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	In regard to the road traffic Bill, it is our intention to bring forward that legislation this session. It is something that has been sought by the House for some time. It will provide an opportunity for Deputies to discuss road safety and road traffic issues.Regarding the question of driver testing, the Minister is anxious to find an interim arrangement that will enable us to deal with that backlog on the basis of obtaining the co-operation of those who are employed in this area to allow him to deal with a situation where clearly the quality of service that needs to be provided for the demand cannot be provided from the existing complement. We will continue to engage with them in the hope that co-operation will be forthcoming.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I note that in the legislative programme for September 2003, the judicial conduct and ethics Bill was promised and the Taoiseach undertook that it would be enacted in 2004. I do not think anybody inside this House or outside it reading this morning's newspapers or listening to the news headlines can be in any doubt about the real urgency that attaches to this Bill. The Minister has said he has a very heavy legislative programme and I notice that the judicial council Bill is now promised on the C list to be published in 2007. It was first promised in 2001 and the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, will be able to advise the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on why it was withdrawn in the context of Nice I in 2001. Six years later all that has changed is the name. It is now called the judicial council Bill.Can I ask the Minister for Finance whether anything can be done to bring forward this Bill? Surely that is the primary task of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than casting envious eyes on the job of the Minister for Finance and telling him how to do it in terms of taxation. From reading the newspapers this morning it is clear that there is an urgency about this Bill. It might have been enacted by now. A commitment was made that it would be enacted in 2004. Can anything be done to bring forward this legislation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I am advised that the draft heads are being prepared in the Department, taking into account work done by the Constitutional Review Group, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution and the Chief Justice's committee on judicial ethics. While I do not wish to comment on a specific case, it is also fair to say that there has been a continuing legal challenge and a jurisprudence has developed as a result of the situation regarding Judge Curtin which has been playing through in the courts in various guises through the various applications that have been made to the courts. Therefore, it would be most imprudent to proceed without taking into account the developing jurisprudence emerging as a result of that rare situation where it is being contemplated by the Oireachtas that there may be grounds for the termination of the judge's appointment.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Surely the evolving jurisprudence is one issue, the question of this Chamber legislating to provide for judicial misbehaviour or misconduct is a separate thing. By all means we should have an eye to the emerging jurisprudence but a Bill promised to be enacted in 2004——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Deputy Rabbitte, we cannot have a debate on the matter this morning. I call Deputy Sargent.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	——is now promised only for publication in 2007.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Deputy has made his point. I call Deputy Sargent.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The point I was making is that considered contributions have been made to the policy formulation process by eminent groups such as the Chief Justice's committee on judicial ethics, the Constitutional Review Group and Oireachtas joint committees. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution, under the chairmanship of Deputy O'Donovan, has been charged with the difficult task of trying to deal with this situation that has arisen in a specific case. We are all mindful that we have to tread very carefully to make sure that constitutional rights are upheld and that fair procedures are respected.In regard to the general situation, the draft heads are being prepared. A great deal of work and consultation has taken place with the relevant personnel. It is an area where we have to be mindful of the separation of powers and principles in the Constitution. It is not a simple issue but that is not to say it is one on which there has been undue prevarication. Much careful consideration has been given to this question. The fact that there is a case before us has to influence how we try to proceed in a way that does not appear to be pre-emptive.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	It is much more difficult to deal with the case because we have not had the legislation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I wish to ask about the Government's promised legislation on disabilities. The Disability Act, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill were intended to all go together in implementing the Government programme in that area. The Comhairle (Amendment) Bill is in abeyance. Will it be taken before the summer recess, given that we have had an announcement about a chair of Comhairle, a high profile former journalist from the Press Gallery——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I am sorry, Deputy, but we cannot discuss the contents of what might be in the Bill. The Minister can reply just on the legislation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The Government needs to tell us where it stands because it cannot appoint a chairperson before the legislation has been passed.I expected to see a date for the animal health Bill, given the bird flu threat that exists, yet UK doctors have attacked the Irish bird flu plan because no public health observer has attended a recent exercise on the Border with Northern Ireland.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	On the legislation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Is there any date for the animal health Bill or is there any seriousness about addressing the threats which face this country and our EU partners as well?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Minister to reply on the legislation.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	31	In regard to the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill, it is often the practice that appointments are made pending statutory powers or amendments being brought before the House. It does not stop these public bodies from effectively discharging their functions and responsibilities. Following calls made in this House for some time we are bringing forward important legislation in this session in regard to health reform, the road traffic Bill we have just discussed, and a whole range of other issues which are not only relevant but topical and important. The programme in this coming session is aligned far more to political priorities than was the case in the past and should be welcomed on that account.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Will it be taken before the summer?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	In regard to the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill, it will be taken in due course.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	What about the disability strategy?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It is unlikely to be dealt with in this session——
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	There were three legs to the strategy.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	38	——given the priorities that this House has been calling for to be dealt with that will be dealt with.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	39	What is the point of it?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	It is not possible to indicate that.

Given the urgency that might arise, is it intended to bring it forward at an early date?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	It is not intended it will be forthcoming this year. It may emerge next year.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	49	It is fortuitous that the Minister for Finance is taking the Order of Business today because under promised legislation it is necessary for him to move rather urgently. I do not know if he is aware that he is the main creditor of a construction company that has gone into liquidation owing the Revenue Commissioners €2.5 million and the workers more than €300,000. This relates to No. 41, company law consolidation and reform Bill. Can we deal with a situation where a company can go into liquidation on one day and continue working the following day with the same workers?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	50	That does not arise on the Order of Business.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	51	It does arise for the Minister for Finance. He is being defrauded of money. I thought we had got rid of this kind of cowboy operation where the same company could transfer from one name to another. I am referring to the PSK construction company defraud as reported in yesterday's newspapers.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Specific matters will be dealt with on the basis of the emerging facts. It is not possible to say when that Bill will be brought forward. I will make inquiries as to the current position regarding the specific matter raised by Deputy Quinn.

For the first time in a series of programme commitments it is not now expected until 2007. Will it be addressed in the time remaining for this Government before the next general election?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	54	That will be decided when the Government decides on the parliamentary programme for the final session. I moved it to 2007 when it was indicated to me that it was unlikely to be ready by 2006. I prefer to give the Deputy the updated accurate information than continue with the idea it would be brought forward this year. I note with interest the fact the Deputy's party is interested in that area.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I wanted to ask about the animal health Bill but my colleague has already done so. It is interesting that there are only two Bills relating to agriculture being brought forward in this session and neither are regarded as urgent. Will the Minister make arrangements for a debate on agriculture in light of the position regarding nitrates——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	56	That does not arise on the Order of Business.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	57	——and the difficulties in dairying?Second, in light of the needs of farming, when will the charities Bill be dealt with?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The charities Bill which has been a long time in gestation should be dealt with some time later this year. I would welcome a debate on agriculture but it is a matter for the Whips.

Good, at least that is a promise kept, not like the one on the Monaghan Hospital issue on the last day before he left office as Minister for Health and Children.The Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006 at last provides a legal framework for a scheme to repay charges to fully eligible people who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long-term residential care. Progress has been far too slow on the part of Government in repaying people on whom these long-term care charges were illegally imposed. It contrasts greatly with the expeditious way in which the Minister moved forward to regularise the exacting of payment from people resident in long-term nursing care.It is well over a year since the courts confirmed that people had been wrongly charged and therefore were entitled to refunds. Legislation and the scheme to repay the money wrongly taken were promised for this time last year. This is the legislation.The Bill confirms that repayments will be made to those who were wrongly charged and are still living, and payments will be made to the estates, usually the nearest surviving next of kin, of those who were wrongly charged and who have died since 9 December 1998. I understand that is the intent.The Government has stated this Bill will become law before the end of May and I want the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, or the Minister, whoever is delivering the summation of Second Stage, to clarify with certainty the intent to ensure the passage of the legislation and, hopefully, the early initiation of the process of repayment.I note the Government has already promised that repayments will start shortly after the passage of this Bill but this, of course, is dependent on the Health Service Executive appointing a private company to administer the scheme. At this juncture, I seek clarification on the need to contract out this work. Does the Health Service Executive lack the resources to administer the scheme? The HSE has already invited people to submit details to it if they think they will qualify for repayment. There is obviously a great number of these as they include the next of kin of those who have died in the period to which I have already referred.In reply to a parliamentary question from myself in October last, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, stated that a national helpline had been set up by the Health Service Executive to allow people to register if they believed they or a family member were due a repayment. Up to the date she answered, in October last, she indicated that some 18,000 applications had been registered with the HSE. She stated the helpline would continue to operate and further stated there was no need for anyone who had already been in contact to make further contact, that ultimately the system which would be put in place would initiate the follow through to the initial contact by the applicant parties.I understand the helpline is continuing to operate. In the summation contribution from the Government side, perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, or his colleagues would indicate the updated numbers of people who have contacted the helpline in the period since October last so we will know exactly the figures we are now considering.If a private company is contracted for the work of making the repayments, are we to presume the data built up to which I have already referred by the Health Service Executive will be transferred to this company? Surely the private contractors would not need to start from scratch. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, would give us an indication of the transition involved if a private company is to anchor the process of repayment entitlement, assessment and the initiation of the repayments.We are told that repayments are due to approximately 20,000 people who are still alive and that approximately a further 40,000, perhaps even up to 50,000, estates will benefit.The bottom line in all of this is that elderly people were illegally charged and must now be reimbursed with the minimum of further delay and bureaucracy. It is no exaggeration to state that it is clear to everyone, and must be an embarrassment to those on the Government side, that there has been such a delay in bringing this legislation forward and initiating the repayment schedules. The tragedy is that the State's shabby treatment of older people under a succession of Governments has caused a great deal of distress. I doubt there is a Deputy who has not become aware of that within his or her constituency.The Government's handling of this particular repayment scheme has caused enormous confusion and worry. People, especially older people in residential care and their families, have been and are worried about it. Proper adequate information must be made available to the public to ensure any confusion remaining is ended quickly. There must be clarity before the scheme gets up and running and everyone, including elected representatives, must secure all the detail of the methodology of application, processing et al. It is extremely important that such matters are addressed speedily. We need to know the steps beyond the helpline and I hope all that information will be shared quickly.The issue has also raised many questions about the way the State supports or fails to support older people in long-term residential care. The National Economic and Social Forum published a report in November last entitled Care for Older People, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, will be familiar and which did not get the attention it deserved. It describes the barriers to the development of community services for older people and it refers to perverse investment incentives. It states:The present official funding of services is not consistent with the policy objective of encouraging community-based responses. Considerable resources are invested in nursing home care responses, some of which are unnecessary and inappropriate.That is relevant to the debate. Bungling by the State resulted in people in nursing homes being wrongly charged and a huge bill was incurred by the Exchequer, which this legislation is designed to meet. The National Economic and Social Forum exposes the fact that in failing to support community-based care fully, the Government is denying older people the most appropriate care and, at the same time, spending large sums on inappropriate nursing homes places. In addition, the private nursing home sector is being subsidised through large tax breaks.I urge the Minister to produce accessible, clear and legible material to explain the repayment scheme fully. It must be presented in a clear and understandable way, without the forbidding and complex constructions of the census form, which will have caused a great deal of concern, particularly for older people. As public representatives, we are a buffer in this instance between the State and the wider community, for which the legislation is intended. We need to assist people at every step and to explain to them in clear terms what are their entitlements and what they need to do to claim them. Perhaps, when the Minister of State replies, he will elaborate on this detail. It is important that the debate should ensure a complete understanding and awareness of the process from start to finish and that nobody is left out of the frame.Will the Minister of State indicate whether it is intended to set a timeframe on the application process for repayment? That is an important issue because people may present later for a variety of reasons such as confusion or disagreement with next of kin and so on. The scheme should be open ended or, at least, the expiry date for applications should be well down the road so that nobody is left out and feels disadvantaged as a result. Given the many years of illegal charging, a long period should be provided to allow people to explore and pursue their entitlements properly.
#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the repayment of charges which were found to have been levied illegally on elderly people, but the debate should go beyond that issue. The primary objective should be to discuss the type and level of care an elderly person can expect to receive when he or she needs it and the debate should also include the question of whether there is agreement on the principle of people paying towards the cost of care and how much they should pay. Previous speakers have dodged that issue and we will not have such a debate. We have mainly witnessed attempts at political points scoring and I will fall into the same trap during my contribution as I comment on the issue raised by Opposition Members.I have been involved with health boards for more than 20 years and I have always been concerned about catch-all phrases such as "care of the elderly" which are used to categorise people. Care of the elderly is a handy category for anybody aged over 65 and it is easy for administrators to use such a description. The equivalent description of those aged under 65 who need high level care is the "chronic young sick". These are two examples of how the State tries to depersonalise the services needed by such people. I would not like my contribution to be totally negative because great work is being done throughout the State on behalf of the elderly and younger people in need of long-term care. We are afraid to get too personal about the people needing such services and I am concerned about the tendency to lump people into a suitable category.Field workers such as those implementing the southern region's Ageing with Confidence project know their client's names, needs and personal requirements but legislators, departmental officials and other decision makers prefer to categorise them in easily identifiable groups because that is handier. It is only when we, as public representatives, deal with the problems facing people at the coalface that we gain an appreciation of what we have legislated for in this rarefied atmosphere. We must never forget that we legislate for individuals, no matter how we categorise them. I fall into that trap when I refer to people aged over 65 and so on. Every elderly person has needs, which are changing, many for the better. Activity programmes promoted by health boards and other interest groups such as the Irish Heart Foundation have had hugely positive benefits. On the other hand, unfortunately, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is increasing and it has not been properly addressed. The State must be prepared to respond more quickly to changing needs.I do not blame the Department because Ministers can make their own decisions, but there is a reluctance to address issues when they are highlighted. When private nursing home subvention was introduced in the late 1970s, a condition was laid down that if the elderly person owned his or her own property, it had to be sold if the need arose to fund the service. A threshold of £75,000 was set and if the value of the person's property exceeded that, it had to be sold. Despite fighting and arguing for between ten and 15 years about the need to recognise increased property prices, the Department was reluctant to adjust the threshold. That is an indication of how reluctant the State is to respond to changing circumstances.If it is agreed the underlying principle is to work to cater for all the medical needs of an individual, we will have made a good start. If we decide that such care should come free of charge or that some level of payments should be made after a certain stage, that is also okay. However, we need to be consistent. Those in this House who state they are opposed to the principle of means testing for services for old people should not also be critical of the decision of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to give medical cards to the over 70s. I argued for that initiative for many years. People at a certain age should be entitled automatically to free medical cards. However, we have got complaints about this from the same people who now urge no means testing.When I started my career in local government, the most humiliating aspect in the care of the elderly was the pensions board. That board was made up of the honourable members of a local council who could delve into the personal details of any elderly person applying for a pension. I am glad that I personally boycotted that board, but there is still an element of that old-fashioned thinking. After the medical cards initiative, we received complaints that millionaires would avail of it. It is ridiculous to think that a millionaire would queue among 20 or 30 others so that he could avail of his medical card, yet people still made political points out of it.Such convoluted thinking also arose during another welcome initiative for the elderly for which I lobbied successive Ministers. Concern has been expressed in this House on many occasions about our unfortunate people who had to leave this island. We often say that we owe them a debt. The best example of repaying that debt came with the courageous decision made by the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, to give those people credit for pre-1953 stamps. Contributions at that time did not contain a pension element and successive Ministers of Finance had opted to follow the Department's guidance on this issue, which was not to give credit. Elderly Irish emigrants in many countries are now enjoying a reasonable pension thanks to that initiative. I believe that the payment from this country is their entitlement. Did those who raise concerns about our elderly emigrants applaud and support this initiative? No. They and their parties questioned and criticised the cost. So much for the concept of caring for the elderly and doing away with means testing. We need to establish standards and levels of care, but we also need some degree of consistency in supporting that concept.These issues have been raised at the Committee of Public Accounts and criticism has been levelled at those who took such courageous decisions. They were easy targets and the cheap criticism was that it cost too much. We can be a caring community or we can be a firm of accountants, trying to get the balance sheet right all the time. Our population is growing older and while we once had the distinction of having the youngest population in Europe, the obvious outcome is that at some point we will have one of the oldest. This legislation has one eye on the past, but also has one eye on the future and the implications of this Bill will be far reaching. We must make some decisions such as whether we provide services that are required by the elderly, whether we respond to their needs in a humanitarian way or whether we take the side of the accountants. We should not criticise decisions that affect the balance sheet if we do not make an allowance for the good of a particular initiative. It has distressed me, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, to hear critical comments when the figures do not turn out as projected. I would prefer to take the initiative when we see the justifiable need for it.There is a conflict between those who want rushed legislation and those who say that such legislation is seldom successful. The same people again seem to be on both sides of that argument. We need to be consistent. The Minister spoke about the possible exploitation and manipulation of the repayments scheme. The majority of the people to receive money are elderly, but in some cases it will be their estate and a proportion will also go to the mentally impaired. When the potential abuse of a patient's private property is considered, it is crystal clear that safeguards must be put in place as part of this Bill. Not everyone is happy with the current position regarding patients' accounts in the general medical services, despite several recent changes. Due to the existence of eight health boards in the past, there has been much inconsistency throughout the country in how these accounts were handled, especially the charges that could be levied for staff wages. There have been many debates on the issue, such as the use of patients' funds to provide a better environment for them. However, proper legislation is not in place to cater for patients' accounts, especially for those who are mentally incapable of making their own decisions. We need a standard formula for patients' accounts generally. I have no objection to a reasonable charge to deal with the millions of accounts throughout the country, but the system should be transparent with no opportunity provided for anyone to delve into the funds. These people have been wronged once and we must ensure they are not wronged again.In its last budget, the Government put new measures in place to fund child care and this Bill is a means of helping those at the other end of the spectrum. It will assist in providing for older people in their community, but we need much more transparent rules on what will be provided to whom. For the past 30 years, there has been much confusion about what is involved. We have had three or four different Acts in this area, including an Act dealing with subventions for private nursing homes. That was very welcome at the time because families were going destitute trying to cater for an elderly relative or friend. That Act was amended to allow for extra subsidies and there were three or four Acts that covered care and related issues. It was so complicated that even Members of this House had no idea from where it came. On the original issue, Deputy McManus, now a member of the Labour Party, stated that the kernel of the problem was that the State broke the law and mugged the elderly and frail. I remind Deputy McManus that it was a former leader and Minister from the Labour Party who brought in the original legislation. I may be wrong in crediting her as a junior Minister in the early 1990s but she has certainly been around for a long time and, given that she holds a brief on health care, I would have expected her to familiarise herself with the genesis of this problem. She could at least have found out who was in the wrong.Every Government of the past 30 years has failed on this issue. I have raised it on a number of occasions but instead of being given satisfactory replies, I was quoted articles, financial subventions and bed contracts. The problem became so convoluted that nobody knew what was happening. However, Members of this House should be familiar with the basic fact that the former Minister for Health, Mr. Corish, introduced a Bill without also bringing primary legislation to allow for charges. The various people who have tried to tamper with it since then are equally guilty and we have all failed in many areas of care for the elderly.We need to change our ways and to stop patronising people. A great deal of good work is being done. The active age concept is being fostered by the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power. We do not need to patronise people because for the most part they are capable of looking after themselves. If they need hospital care, they should get it, regardless of whether that involves beds in Bantry, which I costed against nursing home care in 2001, or elsewhere.The reason we have so many nursing homes, which are most welcome, is that the State failed to provide beds for elderly people in need of care over the past 30 years. Having failed to cater for these people, the final insult is then to tell them that they are holding up beds or to degrade by calling them bed blockers.As a long serving Government Member, I felt guilty when I was informed of the result of a survey carried out in 2002 which indicated that 200 extra beds were needed in Cork alone to care for the elderly. Despite the shouting I have done with regard to care for the elderly, I believe I let my people down and we need to redress that failure. This Bill will deal with historical aspects but I appeal to the Minister of State to build a new regime for the future. We have the money to do so and should be frank in deciding whether a charge should apply or if the full pension, which is topped up for the over 80s and others who need extra help, and the cost of a bed will be paid. People cannot be Tadhgín an dá thaobh on every issue and sooner or later they will have to admit they are concerned for the elderly and that free medical cards and beds should be provided. They cannot have it one way here and another way in the Committee of Public Accounts. I appeal to them to put the elderly first because, although many elderly people will never require any services, thanks be to God, the population is aging and people will need help. For example, I have concerns about our inability to cope with Alzheimer's disease.This Bill is a sort of a fait accompli in that nobody will vote against it but we should use it as a fulcrum to improve services. A great deal of money will be available. There are patriotic people who will refuse the refunds because they want the money to be used for care. Any such money should be ring-fenced for the care of older people. I hate categorising people but, being in the older age group myself, I must be careful when describing us. I foresee a positive outcome and wish the Minister of State well in the job he has been given of sorting out 30 years of political incompetence.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and want to respond to some of the issues raised by Deputy Dennehy. It is important to note that the State has failed our elderly in many ways. The shortage of State run nursing homes is not in the best interests of elderly people because these homes could solve the problem of step-down beds and ease the pressure on accident and emergency units.St. Mary's nursing home in Castleblaney, County Monaghan, is an example of best practice. In former times it was regarded as a poorhouse but people are now queuing to stay there because of the excellent service it provides, not only as a nursing home but as an Alzheimer's disease unit. When Fine Gael entered Government in 1994, two vacant wards in the home were turned into a treatment unit for Alzheimer's disease which, with its accompanying day care service, has become a great success. We should try to expand these services, so that people who have given service to the country over many years are given proper care in familiar environments.Home care, which Deputy Dennehy discussed, cannot be over-emphasised as a means of keeping people out of nursing homes and getting them out of hospitals at an early stage. Despite the promises made by the Minister of State on this issue, I do not see any change on the ground.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Minister of State might explain why a County Monaghan resident with an amputated limb and other serious problems receives two hours of home help per week. She previously lived in County Donegal, where she was given 12 hours of help. These issues must be addressed on a regional basis. Every person, wherever he or she lives, is entitled to equal treatment. Further home care subventions are needed because, while the carers allowance is all right, it is means tested. The allowance could help to keep people out of hospitals and nursing homes and would relieve accident and emergency problems.This Bill was not drafted by accident but as a result of the extremely hard work done by Deputy Perry in bringing this issue to the attention of our party leader and others, having it discussed in this House and, eventually, forcing the Government to admit that it was operating an illegal system. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was fully informed of this issue in 2001 but it is only today that action is being taken. How many elderly people have suffered because of this practice and passed on to eternity without knowing that the money would be refunded? The media are quick to condemn this House and to allege we do not have a role to play, although there are few from the media listening to this debate. This issue came to light through the activity of this House and an astute Opposition. Many Deputies will issue press releases in the next few weeks and months about how many millions of euro they got back for their constituents. Not one penny would have been reclaimed for constituents but for the work of Deputies Perry and Kenny and the indepth efforts of Deputy O'Dowd to expose the nursing home scandal.The Bill only puts in place the legal basis to make repayments to those who were illegally charged in public nursing homes. People who are still alive, or their representatives, will have the right to claim back what was illegally taken from them. What scares me most is that a private company will be employed at a cost of some €40 million or €50 million to send out these payments. I know more about agriculture than about health, and I make no apology for that. The Department of Agriculture and Food can press a few buttons and pay the cheques that are needed for all aspects of farm payments without a private company being involved. Who will dig out information on each patient? I suggest it will be the HSE at local level, which will hand on that information to this private company. It does not make sense to employ a private company to collate this information and issue the cheques. It would be better to give €40 million or €50 million to the HSE and employ extra people if necessary, although with the number of administrators maybe some people could be moved from other areas to do the job. Last week I was trying to have a medical card replaced for a person who was clearly having personal difficulties. The community welfare officer has known the family for years and is convinced the person should have a medical card. However, unlike a few years ago the community welfare officer must go through four or five layers of bureaucracy before that card can be issued. Each layer has to raise some queries to justify its existence. If that process were costed I wonder if it would show that it is better to spend the money on people in need than on administration. Personnel could be taken from this process and used to administer the refunds. I ask the Minister of State and his senior Minister to reconsider giving so much money to a private company to deal with the issue.When the Bill goes through and the structure to pay the money is set up the forms should be made as simple as possible. We do not want a situation where the elderly or their families cannot understand the forms. Former Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, once told us the EU insisted on certain forms for farm building grants, and they were approximately 50 pages long. When I was in Cavan for a publicity stunt and got my first look at the forms, I could not believe I was getting a book rather than a form. Some years later somebody who understands farming better, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and I give her credit for that, provided a short, readable and usable form that satisfies the EU. All things are possible if the will exists. I urge that the form be readable and as simple as possible. I acknowledge that millions of euro are involved and applications must be scrutinised, but let us not go over the top. If it has to be done by legal people, that service must be paid for but we should not allow costs to escalate on a large scale.This Bill deals only with patients in public beds, such as St. Mary's Hospital in Castleblayney or the beds owned by the HSE in nursing homes such as the Sacred Heart Nursing Home in Clones, where my mother was well looked after, along with many others. Many were forced into private nursing homes because public beds were not available and they are as entitled to a refund. Their pension was taken from them although the subvention covered the balance. The same amount was taken from people in private nursing homes and I suggest it would be better to deal with this than to let it go into a long legal battle that will cost everybody more money and delay the right of people to be repaid. I do not suggest that everybody who went to a private nursing home is entitled to a refund; some people decided to go there and did not try to get into a public nursing home. However those who requested a place in a public nursing home, who filled in subvention forms and who had no means other than their pensions are as entitled to get their pensions back as anybody else. I urge that this element be examined and treated seriously. As I said earlier, the delay has meant that many people have died before this issue was dealt with.As one who was involved in the debate on the over-70s medical cards, it also worries me that there is no definite figure on how many are entitled to a refund. I apologise that I was not here to listen to the Minister's speech. I question that situation. Although we have been discussing this situation for a number of years and it is over a year since this Bill was promised, we still cannot put an accurate figure on it. The over-70s cards were originally estimated to cost €19 million but finally cost over €52 million and I wonder how long any business that was run like that would survive. Although I want people to be paid as quickly as possible, and in that context we will not object to this Bill, I want to return to people who were forced into private nursing homes. I know one father who had Alzheimer's disease and whose family desperately wanted to get him into St. Mary's Home in Castleblaney, but there was no room. This was nobody's fault. He had to be moved to a nursing home in Cavan and family members had to pay a significant amount of money towards that through no fault of their own. It would be very unfair if somebody who was lucky enough to get a bed in the special unit in Castleblayney got their money refunded, to which such a person will be legally entitled under the Bill, and that simply because there was no bed, this other family was not repaid. The man's widow must now provide for herself but because the €20,000 or more in their savings was utilised, she has little or no income to live on.I will move to another part of the Bill which has major implications, in particular for the people of my part of the country, where nursing home subvention has been very difficult to access in recent years. From memory — I apologise if I am not exact — there were approximately 270 subvention cases in Monaghan at the time of the previous election. Immediately after, a catastrophe occurred when it was found that there was insufficient funding to justify that number of cases and an attempt was made to reduce the figure to 150. It was then increased to 170 and, eventually, following much pressure from me and others, it was increased to approximately 210 or 220. People of 90-odd years of age were on a waiting list to get subvention. It is in that context that I suggest subvention is very important to my area.In one case, a lady was put into a nursing home in the west. She was dealing with a home that had never had dealings in the north east before. The executive was amazed at the difference between the areas, in particular due to the lengthy and tight scrutiny of a person with no means and because there was such debate whether the person would be covered from the day she entered the nursing home. Eventually, a compromise was reached and the family paid for a month or so. No other case made it clearer to me the differences in practice in different areas.There is an urgent need to reconsider the funding in the north eastern health area, whether it is called a health board area, HSE area or otherwise. The area has experienced an enormous increase in population, in particular in the Louth-Meath area, and a similar increase in the need for care of the elderly. However, it has not received anything but the national increase in funding. There have been cutbacks in subvention, home help and similar issues. These are facts I stand over. The situation in that area is not comparable with other areas.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The 109,000 people of Cavan and Monaghan have had 10,000 medical cards removed, although some have since been replaced. In the city and county of Cork, which have a population of 500,000, only 8,000 cards were removed. There must be a major problem with funding and a major discrepancy.To return to the need for speedy and proper subvention, Cavan General Hospital constantly has 20 to 30 patients on trolleys. There is no doubt this mostly results because people do not vacate beds quickly because there is no alternative accommodation for them, either at home or in nursing homes. The speedy and increased availability of subvention places would obviously relieve this problem and would be more cost effective for the HSE than keeping beds filled with patients who could be elsewhere. It is a scandal that 25 beds of the psychiatric wing in Cavan General Hospital are empty constantly when those beds could be put to other use. I accept that nobody would want a parent or other relative in a psychiatric ward but the ward could be changed and renamed to rectify that situation. There are also long-term beds at Lisdaran which could be changed to short-term use to ease the situation and relieve delays.I welcome that this money will be paid and I hope this happens quickly. However, comments from the Government side suggest that the Government believes a significant amount of that money will not be claimed or requested. I want an assurance that money which is donated will be put into a proper public fund and utilised for the elderly, not for political or other skullduggery.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I thank the Deputy. The Bill provides for a clear legal framework for a scheme to repay recoverable health charges which were wrongly imposed on fully eligible persons for publicly funded long-term residential care. A significant and long-standing feature of our health system of publicly funded long-term care has been the principle that it is fair and reasonable that people should make some contribution to the cost of their long-term care.Most families in my constituency were happy with the long-term care their relatives received in County Longford in both private and public nursing homes. They had no problem making a contribution towards that long-term care because the care in Longford, in public and private nursing homes, is second to none. I am sure the standard is good throughout the country but the standard in my constituency is probably the best in Ireland, with a good quality and delivery of service, good accommodation, good food, good care and good medical attention. That said, I fully accept the Supreme Court decision which found the charges unlawful. We will make that right. Almost all involved told me they were happy with the care and service and did not mind having to make some contribution towards the cost of the service.The Bill will enable full repayments of public long-stay charges to be made to all those who were wrongly charged and are alive today and the estates of all those who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998. It will also allow anyone wishing to put money into various health services to do so from their estates if they do not wish to take up the money. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation with reference to the consumer price index. All repayments to living persons and their spouses will be exempt from income tax. I welcome the important provision that repayments will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits.The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates, as is only right. As I said, the scheme includes a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right and have the money assigned to fund one-off service improvements for older persons and those with disabilities. The application process will be as simple and, importantly, user-friendly as possible, while also providing appropriate safeguards against fraud and the exploitation of those who cannot manage the repayments they will receive.My experience of health care in my constituency is that those administering it, from management through to nurses, doctors and other staff, provide a user-friendly service. That is also the experience of patients availing themselves of the various services. We recognise both that there is a great deal of pressure on staff in the Health Service Executive and that one has a very trying and tough time when one is ill. It is hard enough to be on top of one's form when one is in the best of health, but being sick makes one vulnerable.The patients are very considerate and understanding people and accept a great deal. Sometimes relatives may be a little impatient or hard, and we must recognise that those who work in the health services are due some consideration too. We must advance care for the elderly, with everyone working as a team. Everyone must understand everyone else and work together for a health service of which we can be proud. We can certainly be proud of all those involved in it.The background to the long-stay charge was that on 16 February 2005 the Supreme Court found the Health (Amendment) Act 2004, which contained provisions to introduce legislation to provide a legal basis on which to charge medical card-holders for the maintenance element of inpatient services in long-stay care, to be unconstitutional. Like everyone else, I believe we must observe, obey and respect the courts of the land.The main elements of the Bill address the application process for repayment, how an application is determined, the payment of settlements, the donation of repayments to fund improvements in specific health services, and the operation of patient private property accounts. I hope we do not encounter too many difficulties with that and that common sense will prevail, with relatives, management and the HSE reaching a suitable arrangement to avoid more disagreement.As in everything else, I welcome the inclusion of an appeals process. A special account will be established to facilitate repayments. I also welcome the Government's audit of the scheme. It is estimated that up to 20,000 people still alive, and a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates will benefit. The cost will be approximately €1 billion. Some €400 million has been earmarked for 2006, and the balance will be required in 2007-08.I am glad that the care and service that people receive in public and private nursing homes have improved, although they were always good and very well run in our constituency. People may seek more public beds for the elderly, and perhaps we should try to create more, or work with the private sector so that it designates a certain percentage of such beds in all new private operations.Regarding the elderly, it is important to highlight the many positive developments in their care recently. In case anyone gets the wrong idea from having listened to a previous speaker, we must state that older people are a core priority for the Fianna Fáil-led Government. We are committed to developing a comprehensive range of services for them and will ensure that they can live in dignity. Where necessary, we will provide for them to receive care at home too.I am sure all Members attended on budget day. The Minister referred to the €150 million package in the 2006 budget for new care services for older people, which is the largest ever and will mean a major improvement in home — and community — based support. Thousands in need of care will receive new services and support in 2006.When I tour my constituency or visit the elderly, either at home or in nursing homes, I find they are the happiest people in the country. They are an example to us all, being patient, friendly and courteous, displaying great faith, hope and charity. They are very understanding and undemanding, in most cases content with their lot, and have great peace of mind. They have lived their lives and have seen everything, gaining vast experience. They are quite content and not avaricious or greedy. Once they enjoy a certain standard of living, they are very happy. Most will remind us of expectations in their youth and middle age. They never thought they would see the day when they would be so content, happy and satisfied with the way the Government is treating them, particularly in respect of pensions. As promised, the €200 per week target will be reached and will be paid to these people who deserve it. They worked hard all their lives and made many sacrifices to educate their families. Without their sacrifice, commitment and dedication, we certainly would not enjoy the benefits we enjoy today. Everything comes at a price. Some must make sacrifices for the benefit of others. The elderly of today made major sacrifices so that we could enjoy the benefits.I welcome the fact we owned up, said we were wrong and tried to rectify the situation as quickly as possible. As a goodwill gesture, the Government agreed to make  ex gratia payments of up to €2,000 to those wrongly charged and who were alive on 9 December 2004. So far, the Health Service Executive has made payments in excess of €21 million to approximately 10,800 people. People in my constituency did not expect to get €2,000 as they were happy with the way they had been treated. When the announcement was made that the Government was prepared to make an ex gratia payment of €2,000, many people could not believe it because they felt they had received great care and attention and were looked after. Some 99.9% of people were happy with the system the way it operated. The only aspect about which they may not have been happy was the fact there were not enough beds and there were waiting lists.When the Supreme Court decision was made, it was agreed the money received by the HSE as a result of the imposition of unlawful charges would be repaid. The legislation will allow repayments to be placed in patient private property accounts. These accounts need to be regulated given the significant amount of money which might be in them as a result of repayments of long-stay charges. Patients' private property refers to money and personal possessions patients have with them on admission to care. In the case of long-stay patients, the property also includes regular pension payments. Patient property accounts are operated by the HSE and formerly were operated by the health boards and support clients in managing their financial affairs and assist them in dealing with various aspects of daily living. The patient private property account system manages the private money of long-stay patients which may include pension income, maintenance charges, spending money or comfort payments to patients or clients and lodgments to accounts. This scheme will be operated in the most equitable and effective way possible.The HSE said that in the circumstances it was necessary to put a new procurement process in place and subsequently placed an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European Union on 2 February 2006. We expect the appointment of a successful company at the end of April with repayments likely to commence in June 2006. The people can look forward to this happening.I do not believe there are any dissenting voices. This Bill has the unequivocal support of all Members of the House. I do not believe anybody could disagree with this legislation since all those wrongly charged for inpatient services will be repaid in full. It is unfortunate people were wrongly charged. We cannot, under any circumstances, condone anybody not obeying the law.I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Power, and will continue to do so as long as he continues to do the great job he is doing. I fully support the Bill.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I wish to deal with this measure under a number of headings, namely, the history of the saga which goes back to the early 1970s, the hand-over between the former Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Tánaiste, the first Bill which was deemed unconstitutional and the one we are now discussing and the prospects for administration. It is important to state at the outset that if anybody wanted to do a PhD on public administration in the Irish governmental system over the past two decades which span the administration of different political combinations, this would be a wonderful test case to examine. I have some experience of it from my time in Government.The complexity of the issue and the structure which presides in health as distinct from local government is a major contributing factor to all of this. It is also important to state that nothing wrong was done. What was done was illegal but it was not wrong. I do not believe anybody has challenged the fact that somebody with a non-contributory pension getting full-time care should make a contribution from that pension to his or her upkeep since he or she is in care 24 hours per day, seven days per week. What was wrong about it was that it did not have statutory underpinning.A former leader of my party was the first Minister to introduce the system or to give it his accord. On numerous occasions, things have been done in good faith, were deemed to be correct and were politically sanctioned but did not have the necessary legal statutory authority for them to be implemented. This is one example. I understand from the contribution of my colleague, Deputy McManus, that the only person who really spotted the problem was the late John Boland who had an eagle eye and a sharp tongue. In the short two month interregnum after the Labour Party left Government in 1987 when the election was inevitably coming, he clearly saw this legal lacuna and that the gap would have to be properly underpinned by some type of statutory measure. It was on the table for the incoming Fianna Fáil Minister for Health, the Ceann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, but for reasons we do not know and probably never will, unless the freedom of information legislation or the 30-year rule reveal otherwise, it was not high on the agenda of that slash-and-burn Government. I do not believe the Minister of State, Deputy Power, supported the head of it at the time but those were different days.We fast forward then to the view of the chief executive of the former Southern Health Board who raised a possible problem. He got the legal opinion which brings us up to the eventful day — 16 December — in the Gresham Hotel. That takes us to the modern history and the hand-over.I wish to focus on a test case of how bad this Administration is and how utterly incompetent it is as a collective entity. Although the Minister of State, Deputy Power, has been sent into the House, as Deputy Kenny said, his hands are clean. He was a million miles away from the scene of the so-called cock-up. The Labour Party and Fianna Fáil introduced the system of programme managers and special advisers to ensure the political corpus of a Minister could be in three places at the one time. It was also to ensure civil servants could have political direction that knocked heads between different Departments, safe in the knowledge their loyalty to their own Department was in no way compromised by their need to accept a political compromise authorised by a programme manager with the clear authority that would come in due course from the Minister. It was a very good system, it worked extremely well during my experience with Fianna Fáil and it was about governance rather than publicity. It was about fast-tracking decisions and avoiding cock-ups and mistakes. Frequently Ciaran O'Meara or Greg Sparks would have addressed me, Ministers from Fine Gael, the rainbow coalition or Fianna Fáil as follows, using language that no civil servant could ever employ: "For Christ sake, Minister, if you don't get your act together on this matter, the party will be in serious trouble". Self-evidently, civil servants cannot adopt that language, nor should they. They can draw attention diplomatically to what, in the words of Sir Humphrey, might be a very brave decision to make. However, they cannot be as brutally frank as a programme manager needs to be and should be. It is hard to be such.I say advisedly, from my vantage point of limited knowledge, that programme managers and special advisers were more concerned with the image of the former Minister for Health and Children than the content of his head. If he did not have time to read the documentation discussed in and around the meeting of 16 December, he could have consulted the two advisers who were paid to read it to look out for landmines and problems. One of them, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, did so. However, he is not of the same party and he is very inexperienced in political terms, although he may be a wise man in many other respects. He did not deal with the issue. The former Minister of State, Deputy Callely, says he spoke to the Taoiseach and was to talk to the then Minister about the issue, but there is no record of this. Ultimately, at a meeting of the committee that subsequently inquired into this matter, the former Minister denied all knowledge of it. However, the former Secretary General of the Department said he did brief him. We know what happened thereafter. The current Minister, Deputy Harney, took over the job. She knew everything about everything, and still does, and introduced a Bill that was struck down because it was not unconstitutional.To return to my suggested theme for a PhD, let me put in context the difficulty the Department of Health and Children faced at the time and which it faces now. Given that the current Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, was previously a member of a county council, he may accept the analogy I will draw. There is never a problem like the one in question in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government over what is being spent in Kildare County Council in light of what the Custom House knows. The legal and administrative structures and the political traditions, dating from the commencement of the County Management Acts, ensured that the Custom House had, at all times, a very good handle on what was happening. It had a local accounts auditor supervising and finding out relevant information. More important, at the local level the administrative staff from the county manager down, under the scrutiny of the councillors — I am primarily talking about management rather than politics — had a dominant but not a domineering relationship to the technical staff, be they engineers or architects. The same cannot be said for the structure in the health system. The Department of Health and Children, which was not housed in an elegant Gandon building like the Custom House but in what is probably the worst building in the city, and certainly one of the most unhealthy, had a semi-detached relationship with the local health boards and various health agencies. This relationship was not of its making because of the historical way in which the health services increasingly came within the public domain.From calculating Estimates while in the Department of Finance, I know that, of all Departments, the Department of Health fared worst because it could not get a hard handle on figures. It did not receive the figures and there were so-called demand-led schemes. I produced three budgets in the Department of Finance and at all times got the impression that the Department of Health was dealing with estimates of figures based on estimates coming from estimates. It was always difficult. Additionally, the management history of the Department of Health and Children is probably one of the worst, with the exception of the management histories of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Agriculture and Food. Can one think of any other Department in which a senior civil servant took the Secretary General to court on the grounds that a promise of promotion had been reneged upon after a serious performance by that person in respect of a health scandal? The Department of Health and Children, through no choice or fault of its own, went from crisis to crisis owing to agencies for which it was ultimately responsible.It is against this background that we should examine this Administration and, in considering this Bill, determine whether lessons can be learned and applied. I am not in the business of attributing blame and asking people to take responsibility — the electorate will ultimately make this choice. However, if one is trying to manage what is perhaps the most complex and expensive Department in terms of its budgetary allocation, and perhaps the most difficult because of the dominance of health professionals in the system, as opposed to the position of environmentalist professionals in the local government system, who represent the technical side rather than the administrative side, and who come into the Department from a smoothly run Department such as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the smartest thing is not to fire the general who is in charge.Consider the circumstances that would obtain if any one of us elected politicians worked in an organisation that was constantly in the front line, dealing with agencies that were not telling the truth and in some cases telling lies, and had a Secretary General with a reputation among his peers for commitment and professionalism, which I certainly noted. The former Minister for Health and Children, who had responsibility, paid advisers to read the briefs and two Ministers of State who knew there was a landmine ready to blow up, claimed he knew nothing about the matter in question, yet, to protect the security of this coalition Government, the current Minister, Deputy Harney, instead of demanding the head of the former Minister, fired Michael Kelly. When she could not fire him properly he was promoted to a higher-paid job.Some day somebody will write this story in its entirety. The political group in this Chamber, charged with a very professional Civil Service, will not come out of it well. If collective responsibility means anything, it must be noted that the current occupants of these benches have reneged on the mandate and responsibility the citizens of this Republic give to us. This is why there is a lesson to be learned from this saga.The issue does not just extend this far. The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, had no direct responsibility in the matter. Where do we stand now? We, on this side of the House, are supposed to scrutinise legislation and it is our task to hold it to account. Nobody has a monopoly on truth and no drafter of legislation can see around all the corners all the time. When the first Bill to address the overpayment issue was introduced by the current Minister for Health and Children, my colleague Deputy McManus said it was probably unfounded and unconstitutional. However, the Minister, who knows everything and who was to transform the health service with a magic wand, refused to accept this criticism. On foot of the culture she engendered by effectively politically sacking the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children within a week of entering office, what other senior civil servant will have the nerve to try to tell her something? Would the Minister of State or anybody else do so? What kind of climate of terror and intimidation was created among a group of individuals who did not know the hell what was going on in most of the hospitals because they were told lies, but who were politically accountable therefor nevertheless? I do not refer to high-speed senior management expertise but to common decency and respect for citizens who, because of the political vow of neutrality they make to ensure a non-corrupt Civil Service, for which we are eternally indebted, are defenceless when treated in the manner I have described.The first Bill was found unconstitutional and contrary to the advice of this House. It was introduced because the current Administration knows everything. If the Minister for Health and Children does not, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform certainly does. They have an obsession with private sector magic wands that will cure every ill in the country. I know Fianna Fáil does not believe in these because they are patent nonsense, but it must go along with the Progressive Democrats because it needs their votes.If one passes through Dublin Airport this summer, one will recall the insistence of the Progressive Democrats that Aer Rianta be broken up and that the new terminals should compete against each other. Nowhere else in the world is there such a nonsense in terms of infrastructure provision but, because of that ideological stand-off and since the tail is wagging a very big populist dog, millions of passengers will be put through hell in the airport as a consequence.We have the same nonsense in the method of administration by hiring a private company to do something for which no private company has the expertise in this country. There is no expertise in the private sector to administer payments of this kind retrospectively, yet in the public sector three such organisations exist. The Revenue Commissioners do this kind of work all the time and have fantastic expertise. They run the public service payroll. If we did not want to use them to do it, we could use the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which is also on the payroll. It has a body of expertise and entrepreneurial skill, and has the wisdom of experience having learnt from mistakes made in the past. Why was it not possible to get a task force of the best administrators from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and perhaps the National Treasury Management Agency to deal with the problem and when the problem was dealt with, the group could have been stood down and the individuals could have returned to their sections?This in effect is what a Department is: a semi-permanent task force set up to address a particular problem, staffed by professional full-time civil servants with the assistance of external consultants where needs be. The Department of Supplies during the Second World War, the Department of the Gaeltacht, the Department of Labour and the Department of Equality and Law Reform were all established for specific tasks and when that set of tasks was completed, the Department was stood down and the civil servants moved to other Departments.There is no need to waste citizens' money of the order of €50 million for administration. If that figure is not accurate, perhaps the Minister of State could correct me. The company that gets the contract will interview people from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners. Nobody will get a fee for this. The company will pick the brains of officials and will write a report based on the knowledge taken from staff employed by the State. It will then charge the Government a fortune to tell it what these people are paid to tell it professionally if it had the courage to listen to them in the first instance.There is a lesson in this sad saga. It is about arrogance and incompetence combined with a sense that the Government knows it all and that nobody can tell it anything. When that point of incompetent arrogance is reached, the emergency panic button that is the key to a successful democracy kicks in. The real value of a democracy, as the people of Nepal are struggling to discover, is not the right to elect a government but the right to fire one. It is not the right to choose the government of people's liking, but the right to get rid of the government that has become incompetent, incapable, blind and deaf. While I know, admire and like many Government Deputies individually, sadly, collectively, like a team, their performance is worse than that of Leinster last Sunday.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Much has been said and much more will be said on this issue. I do not disagree with much of what Deputy Quinn said. The last thing we want to do is use vulnerable people in nursing homes as a political football. I do not suggest that anybody is deliberately trying to do so. There is no point in apportioning blame at this stage. I am sure this will be investigated at some other time. We need to try to achieve excellence in public administration in our health service. If we do so we will be working in the interest of patients, the public and staff.It is important that people in long-term care and their families should have clarity about how care will be provided and paid for. It is important too that where mistakes are made, they are recognised, responsibility is taken and the lessons are learned and applied. Many mistakes have been made and many changes of direction have occurred, some of which have been poorly thought out. Let us not apportion blame. The issue of charges for those in long-term care has been ongoing for some time and has continued under various Governments of all political parties. The issue of the charges is being addressed in as good a way possible in the circumstances.Notwithstanding that the policy had consistent support and that people received a benefit for their payment, the Government believes that repayments should be made because a mistake was made. We should all be sufficiently honest to hold up our hands and say the money belongs to those people and they need to have it returned. I heard other contributors make valid points. The issue that triggered the matter in the public mind was the debate about Leas Cross nursing home, many of whose 116 residents regarded it as their home, which became the pilot for the investigation into how this debacle took place.The Bill will ensure that all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive, and the estates of those eligible persons who were wrongly charged and died since 9 December 1998, will have the charges repaid in full. The issue of the Statute of Limitations and related issues may need further clarification. As 20,000 people who are still alive and a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates will benefit from repayments under the scheme, it indicates the scale of the problem. Even if €1 billion needs to be repaid, so be it. However, let us try to learn from what happened.Essentially we are discussing the care of the elderly. It is a moot point whether this has been a priority for Governments of all parties up to now. However, from now on we must put the needs of the elderly at the forefront. While the Bill concentrates on repayments of money illegally charged to people in nursing homes, let us try to get to the stage where fewer people need to end up in nursing homes.I heard another speaker refer to the county homes. In their time they did a fantastic job. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Costello, will know that St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park provides the very highest possible quality of care for the elderly. While it is a fairly austere building, the quality of provision is second to none. We need to ensure that level of care is replicated elsewhere. While they have been much criticised, I pay tribute to the health boards and now the Health Service Executive for the way they have developed homes in the public sector. I would much prefer to see more provision delivered through the public sector than through the private sector. However, we are where we are.Last week a senior official in a hospital in the Dublin area told me that it had been given permission to purchase additional public beds in private nursing homes. He also told me that those beds would be acquired in places as far away as Wexford, Drogheda and Dundalk. Most of the patients in my constituency go to a northside hospital where they are being accused of being bed blocking. Transferring them to somewhere in Drogheda or Wexford would be a great imposition on their families. It is unfair and the issue of distance needs to be borne in mind. We should drive our policy to ensure families can expect that their mostly elderly parents can be looked after in their own homes. I have heard other people referring to the home help service, which was an amateur Cinderella service for many years. The Government has been much criticised, but it should be credited with putting the home help service on a much more secure footing. It is not that long since the providers of that service were paid not much more than pocket money. I accept they are still not being paid much more than the minimum wage, but they are now working towards the provision of a paramedical service. That is an area we could develop much more.The issue of nursing home packages trips off the tongue very easily. I have learned, from the inquiries I have made, that it may be more difficult than people think to put together a nursing home package. Not only will nurses have to come in to look after patients in their homes, but services like occupational therapy, doctor on-call services and physiotherapy will also have to be provided. We need to ensure, before we raise people's expectations by deciding to provide thousands of nursing home packages, that we are able to put such packages together.I raised the issue of appropriate housing for elderly people during a debate on another Bill. Local authorities should step up to the plate in that regard, but they are not all doing so. I am most aware of the experience at Dublin City Council level. I credit that council for pioneering good quality housing for elderly people. I have noticed recently that the council is working in partnership with organisations like Respond and co-operating with the HSE to provide centres in which a model of care that works and could be replicated is offered. Respond, Dublin City Council and the HSE are working together in Finglas, which is in my constituency of Dublin North-West, to provide and manage a centre in which elderly people can live in a manner that is quite independent. Although they have their own homes, they are dependent on the provision of services like those offered by nursing homes, such as meals and medical services. That is an example of an approach that works.The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, is familiar with the Odenswood day care centre in Finglas, which is another example of an intervention facility provided by the HSE. The centre provides care, in the form of medical and personal services, for up to 80 patients each day. Those who want to spend half a day in the centre have to stay on a waiting list for six months or a year. There is a need for many more centres of that nature.I cannot understand why much more use is not made of the disabled person's grant scheme, which is probably administered reasonably well in Dublin, as a means of keeping people at home. I have heard of sorry cases, like the case of a woman whose leg had been amputated. Her family wanted to provide hand rails so that she could get into her House. She had to be kept in hospital for an additional 12 weeks while an occupational therapist was found to write a report, to supplement a report which had already been written, to recommend that hand rails and a walk-in shower, etc., should be provided. There is no reason such issues cannot be more speedily resolved, with a little more inter-agency co-operation.I am sure the Acting Chairman, Deputy Costello, is aware of the imminent transfer of some long-stay patients from certain units in James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown. Their families have not been given sufficient notice of the transfer of their relatives to public beds in private hospitals throughout the Dublin area while units 3 and 5 are being refurbished which, in my experience, will take two years or more. Although the families will be able to cope with the disturbance that will be caused, the patients will experience great difficulty. I know of patients who have been in the units in question for up to eight years — the hospital is their home. We know about the trauma that can be associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, for example. We need to streamline such issues and learn from such cases.This Bill represents an effort to address the injustice that was perpetrated on elderly people and their families by all parties. There is no point in saying that one party was more responsible than another. It should not have happened, but it did. I hope the repayment scheme will be administered with minimum fuss. It should be done speedily, efficiently and in a most transparent fashion. The Money Advice and Budgeting Service has a role in this regard. It worked quite well when awards were being made by the Residential Institutions Redress Board. The Department of Health and Children should encourage those who operate this repayment scheme to engage with the budgeting service to ensure that people to whom a fairly substantial amount of money is suddenly paid look after that money properly and wisely. The budgeting service has a good record in that regard. With that caveat, I welcome the Bill.

The announcement by the Minister for Health and Children that people in long-term care institutions in the State had been wrongfully charged for their stays is still a vivid memory for me, as it is, I am sure, for all the Members of the House. That issue has been fully debated in the House. The Bill under discussion is the result of the Minister's commitment to repay the moneys which were wrongly taken from patients.

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	140	The huge amount of money that was taken from patients under defective legislation — the cost has recently been estimated at more than €1 billion — must be repaid. I understand that more than 20,000 people who are still alive will be eligible to recover money, on foot of this legislation, and refunds of moneys will be paid into the estates of almost 50,000 people who have died. The recent Supreme Court judgment highlighted the fact that the Statute of Limitations means that the estates of people who died before December 1998 will not be eligible for repayments, unfortunately. I welcome the fact that the repayments will comprise not only the actual charges which were imposed on patients, but an amount that takes account of inflation, calculated by reference to the consumer price index since the time when the person was wrongfully charged. The payment of the extra amount is just and correct because patients have been denied the use of the money in question since the illegal charge was first imposed. It is obvious that any interest they may have gained from such moneys should be included in the repayment scheme.On an unrelated but similar issue, I have frequently wondered why the Revenue Commissioners do not adopt a similar approach when they are dealing with tax refunds in the cases of people who have overpaid their tax liabilities. I recently heard about the case of an individual who received a tax refund in February 2006 in respect of tax that was overpaid in 2004. She did not receive an additional amount that was calculated to take account of inflation in the intervening period. I suggest that the Revenue Commissioners should follow the example being given by the Minister for Health and Children in this Bill. It is interesting that all repayments to living persons will be exempt from income tax. Such repayments will not be taken into account when the means of individuals are being assessed for health or social welfare benefits.I congratulate the Minister on this progressive and innovative legislation, which recognises that patients were wrongfully charged in the first place. Therefore, what these people are getting, in effect, is the return of their own money. While they will be getting it all in one sum, this should not and will not deprive them of any benefits to which they might normally be entitled. It is not the fault of the individual patient that money was wrongly taken from him or her. Therefore such patients should not be penalised in any way because those moneys are being returned to them now.Since this issue first came to light I have been approached by a number of constituents representing patients who are still alive, thankfully, but also others who are involved on behalf of relatives who have died. The words of one particular lady resonate with me. She said, "The care that my late father received while he was in St. John's Hospital in Sligo, was of the highest order and I do not wish to avail of the repayment". I welcome the provision in the Bill that allows any eligible person to waive his or her right to a repayment. The fact that any money so waived will be assigned to fund one-off service improvements for older people and those with disability, is also very welcome. It is important that such money is ring-fenced for those improvements to which it is assigned.I will even go further and ask that if possible, the money should be used for improvements in the institution in which the patient resided. In that way the institution that provided the care to the patient will benefit directly. This idea might not be administratively possible, but I ask the Minister of State to examine it. After all, if any institution provided care that was of such a high standard that the patient or his or her relations felt positive about, it is surely only right and proper that it should be first in line to benefit from the generous waiving of the repayment money.As I said at the start, the amount of money involved in this process is very large — close to €1 billion. When one considers that the total health budget for 2006 is €12 billion, then the enormity of the repayment cost can be appreciated. The potential for fraud or wrongful repayment is recognised and I welcome section 17(2) which makes legal provision for the recovery of any moneys obtained through fraud or overpayment. Every euro must be repaid correctly, but because of the enormity of the sums involved, due care must be taken that the moneys are repaid to the correct persons. It is also important that there is a clear appeals mechanism in place for those who believe they might not have been treated correctly in the repayment process. Section 16 of the Bill deals with the appeals process in some detail. Hopefully, it will not have to be used. However, if a situation should develop where there is a dispute between an applicant and the repayments scheme, then the appeals process, as proposed, is transparent and fair.I am glad that the Bill deals with the unfortunate situation of patients who have a degree of mental or intellectual impairment. It will ensure that where there has been a deterioration in the intellectual capacity of a patient, his or her rights are protected by the use of a patient private property account. This will mean that any funds accruing to patients in this category will be used for the benefit of the individual and that the money can be invested on behalf of the said patient. This Bill will correct what was a serious wrong to patients in long-term care institutions. It is right and proper that the Government is taking this line of action. It will be successful, with sufficient safeguards in place to ensure there is no misuse of the enormous amount of money involved. I commend the Bill to the House.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and to deal specifically with some aspects. Like other contributors I am concerned about the need to ensure there is proper care for the elderly.The delay in bringing the legislation before the House has been remarked on by many speakers. It is unfortunate that the elderly have had to wait such a length of time since this matter was first raised by Deputy Perry. They have had to wait until now to see some movement on the moneys illegally deducted from them which the State has a duty to repay. If the boot were on the other foot and the patients or their families were obliged to pay the State moneys for services, a time interval of this duration would not be tolerated under any circumstances. Many people have asked me whether the repayment had been made, why they did not get it and so forth. People do not understand why there has been such an extensive delay in bringing this legislation before the Dáil.No doubt there is a need for proper funding of care for the elderly. The elderly population is growing. One in 20 old people will need long-term care at some time in their lives. Much of this will be for a relatively short period — three to five years on average. It is important that the State identifies, plans and finances proper care for the elderly.We see a growing difficulty with nursing homes. The subvention system has not been reviewed for six years and a great deal has changed in the interval. Most of all, the cost of nursing home care has grown substantially and the level of subvention has not increased proportionately. Will the Minister of State comment on the need for a full re-examination of nursing home subventions?People have great difficulty in understanding the approach being taken by the Health Service Executive and the Department towards the public-private use of long-term care for the elderly. There should be clear criteria on who is eligible for long-term public care, with clearly outlined reasons for any refusal of an application. The present situation seems very vague and it is difficult to understand how decisions are arrived at. Such matters should be very transparent. This would assist public representatives who can only tell constituents at present that HSE policy is to steer people towards private nursing homes. While the HSE considers admitting people to public nursing homes, neither the criteria involved nor the examination of applications is transparent. There is need for much greater transparency to remove much of the suspicion, including many of the incorrect reports we get as well. There is no way to examine the systems for determining whether a person qualifies for a private or public facility.I have long been concerned about the mechanisms for consulting elderly people in hospital on their treatment and discharge. In most situations discussions take place between the family and the consultant or the hospital authorities. Often the patient is ignored or not informed about what is happening. This is wrong and very disrespectful to the individual patient. Just because people are elderly does not mean they do not have views, stresses or concerns about their conditions. While some families keep their elderly relatives informed, in many cases families are not in a position to reassure elderly patients who are admitted to hospital for strokes, heart attacks or other serious problems in regard to their future. In many cases it is obvious that patients are not in a position to return home and their future is often discussed at one remove from them. That is an area we should examine to ensure that the approach taken to patients aged 85 is as inclusive as it would be in terms of patients aged 25 or 35.The maintenance of people in their homes for as long as possible should be seen by the Minister and the HSE as an investment rather than a cost because it is preferable to paying nursing home subventions and the cost of public nursing homes. Home helps could be used much more effectively and more extensively to assist people to stay in their homes. I heard of a case recently where the home help of somebody in receipt of five hours of home help was unable to continue and another person was obtained who lived six miles away. The person in receipt of home help was informed that their home help hours would be reduced to three hours and they would have to pay for the travel expenses of the new home help.Despite numerous assurances following discussions in this House we have not moved towards integrating and rationalising the area of special housing aid for the elderly, essential repairs grants and disabled person's grants for people aged over 65 years. The present system is confusing and leads to a waste of resources. Work should be completed by local authorities according to clearly set criteria and a proper budget should be supplied which would considerably reduce the administration of the system.Essential repairs grants can be quite effective in improving the housing conditions for the period of an elderly person's life. The special housing aid for the elderly scheme has a similar function but is much more cumbersome in terms of completing the work and although the cost to the person concerned is less, delays are more likely. The disabled person's grant is similar to the essential repairs grant but the need for an occupational therapist's report and other requirements before a decision is made can result in considerable delays and makes the system cumbersome. We need an overall policy on the level of care to which elderly people are entitled. The denial of moneys to people that is outlined in the Bill does not augur well for the State's approach to the elderly. This must change.I wish to address the issue of people with medical cards in private nursing homes, to which some of my colleagues have also referred. Has the Department examined the situation whereby elderly people are in private nursing homes who were refused admission to public nursing homes despite the fact that they had medical cards? Does the Minister of State accept he has some responsibility for this area? Events may proceed in such a fashion in the courts that it is decided there is some responsibility for the State towards those with medical cards who were refused beds in public nursing homes and went into private nursing homes.I am aware of many people with medical cards who went directly to private nursing homes because they were advised by hospital authorities, doctors and others that it was pointless applying for long-term care beds in public nursing homes. As a result, these people made the decision not to apply for those beds. As a politician I have often advised people that the chances of obtaining a bed in a public nursing home are very small and that in the interests of the patient and because of the delay in the decision making process, it would be advisable to go to a private nursing home. Many people have not applied for long-stay beds in public nursing homes even though they have medical cards.Those who will benefit from the repayments outlined in the Bill are, for the most part, in the final years of their lives in long-term care and do not have much time to enjoy the refund. It is disappointing that there has been such a delay because many people who would have had some enjoyment from the refund have now passed on without having had the opportunity to do so. In reply to what the Minister of State said about the average length of a person's stay in a nursing home, it is two to three years, which is not a long time.I understand the Department of Health and Children has made ex gratia payments of €21 million to 10,800 people. As the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, pointed out, the HSE, which assists the new organisation responsible for making the payments, will have to pay people who are alive first, which amounts to 10,000 people. The Minister of State may be correct but I understand that repayments are due to up to 5,000 deceased people who have died since the first legislation appeared in November 2002. If the Government continues at this rate, most eligible people will have passed away before the payments begin. The Supreme Court reinforces this in its statement that whatever expectations may exist, it is an indisputable fact that the Bill will affect many people who are old, poor, disabled, mentally and physically ill and in many cases will have all these conditions. Such patients will have little or no capacity to understand their rights under the legislation or to protest against the unlawfulness of the charges nor will they have the pleasure of enjoying the refunds being made by the Government.The explanatory memorandum provided with the Bill consists of one page. We are accustomed to receiving detailed information in explanatory memoranda to Bills whereby sections of the legislation are explained in more detail. The Government has had more than a year in which to prepare this legislation and I expected the explanatory memorandum to be more detailed. Many of us are not very legally literate when it comes to reading legislation——

We questioned on a number of occasions the reason the HSE could not undertake this work. Deputy Quinn referred to other efficient and experienced Departments such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs who would be capable of doing this work. The Department of Health and Children has successfully dealt with the surviving 10,000 people in a very short period by making ex gratia payments through the use of departmental records. It is surprising that an outside company is required to deal with the estates of the 40,000 to 50,000 deceased people. Any delay incurred if the HSE undertook this work would not make much difference to their estates and will certainly not make any difference to the patients themselves. I am surprised the HSE, considering its staffing, is not in a position to undertake this job when it was perfectly capable of dealing with matters up to this point. One of the reasons for the establishment of the HSE was to rationalise the system and create efficiencies within the overall system for the delivery of health care. I am confident the HSE has sufficient staff numbers to address this issue. I ask the Minister of State to explain the reason he has not considered the expertise within the HSE rather than going to an outside organisation. Is the Minister of State passing a vote of no confidence in the HSE by outsourcing something which is a matter of public administration?The mistakes were made by the Government and should be dealt with by the HSE if it is to demonstrate the improvement it has supposedly brought to the health services. The HSE began collecting information on who was entitled to repayment. Employing consultants to administer the scheme seems strange when the HSE has already dealt with ex gratia payments worth €20 million to more than 10,000 people. The Minister of State informs the House that a consultancy firm will be engaged in April. Will the Minister of State confirm that the consultants have been engaged and whether contracts have been signed or will this be announced at a later stage?I hope the forms which must be completed by patients or their families will be as simple as possible. Patients or their families should not be required to make claims in duplicate. If the HSE has most of the information there should be no need for patients to complete forms. Whatever way it is administered I hope the forms will not be used as a delaying tactic to avoid making the repayments.

#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I intend to hold on to it.The delay in bringing this Bill before the House is outrageous. The Bill seeks to address a wrong that was perpetrated on one of the most vulnerable sections of the community and who deserved a quicker response. As other speakers have pointed out, if the Minister for Health and Children's predecessor, Deputy Martin, had read the memos from his staff on the illegality of nursing home charges, we might not have had to wait so long. However, given that Deputy's habit of seeking a report or inquiry on everything that came his way, we might have had to wait even longer. It is more than 14 months since the Supreme Court deemed the Minister, Deputy Harney's Bill to be unconstitutional. It was a shameful attempt to legalise blatant fraud. Since then, the introduction of this Bill has been deferred from one quarter to another. It has been a source of deep embarrassment to all Members of the House since then that any query we received asking when repayments might be made could only be answered with uncertainty due to the foostering and bumbling of the Tánaiste in trying to put a repayments mechanism in place. There is now supposed to be a user-friendly, uncomplicated process which is independent, transparent and through which swift repayment will be made to all those due repayments since 9 December 1998. I hope it will do exactly what it says on the tin.The need for an independent and overseeing body for the administration of the repayments process and management of the private property accounts should be explained to the House, considering there are Departments such as the Department of Social and Family Affairs which pays millions of euro every week in benefits. Why is there a need to pay an outside agency to take charge of the repayments?Similarly wasteful has been the tendering process for a body to make these repayments. The Health Service Executive so much enjoyed the process the first time that they did it twice. If ever there was an illustration of the lack of public confidence in the Department of Health and Children, it was that the first tendering process could not attract one suitable company willing to be associated with this shambolic administration.This repayment process will be audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. He should intervene now and insist that the repayments be made by existing Departments which are already audited by his office and so save the taxpayer enormous expense. Although the House has debated the overcharging by nursing homes and the Travers report dealt with the history of the levying of those charges, the simple fact remains that except for Mr. Michael Kelly, a senior civil servant who was far from being solely or totally to blame, no one has been held responsible for not taking action on the overcharging when notified of it. There is anecdotal evidence that when challenged about the legality of the charges in individual cases, some health boards simply stopped charging those individuals. The practice was highlighted in the annual reports of the Office of the Ombudsman in 1989, 1992, 2001 and 2003, yet no action was taken.Due consideration should be given to those who are not competent to make a claim which is unfortunately the case in a substantial percentage of those entitled to make a claim. The Minister should ensure that workshops staffed by employees of the health service visit the various nursing homes and ensure that all those who are entitled to repayments make a claim.In my constituency a share of patients live in St. Joseph's in Raheen and in Ennistymon and Kilrush geriatric hospitals. I have visited those hospitals, some of which are of a very high standard. The patients enjoy great care but I can tell the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, that the staff work in atrocious conditions.I strongly urge the Minister to set up visiting workshops. A faceless telephone helpline is useless in these circumstances. It is time for the Government to face up to the health care needs of the elderly. A comprehensive report to tackle the care needs of our elderly is urgently needed. This needs to be addressed positively with elderly care specialists and support teams based in the community, and we need to put an end to the statement that caring for the elderly is increasingly problematic in the health system, which merely promotes ageism in society.Given the delay in bringing this Bill before the House, the length of time the practice of illegally collecting the charges continued, and that no claims prior to 9 December 1998 can be made, it would have been appropriate that the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, would at least have included in the Bill a deadline by which repayment claims received would have been paid, but even this consideration to the elderly in the community was beyond her.Let me deal with a statement made in this House last night, that patients, before being discharged into the community, are seen by a doctor and then by an occupational therapist, and then when they are discharged they are visited in their homes by an occupational therapist. Is the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, aware that one must wait six months to get an occupational therapist in County Clare, unless one is able to pay up front?Subvention is another matter. A lady whose mother is in a nursing home came into my office the other day. On applying for subvention the health board wanted her to sell the family home in order that her mother could remain in care. Would anyone in this House today like to see their family home sold? Often the family homes and farms such people own are part of family settlements. The health board will demand that those homes be sold to keep a loved one in care. A generous subvention should be given and home help made available on a regular basis, which is not the case.People looking for home help in my county cannot get it. In west Clare an elderly man who needed home help in January last was told to apply again in April when the money became available.This is the Government which tells us we have a great health system on which it has spent millions. It has squandered, not spent, millions on it. A root and branch analysis of the health boards was never undertaken. The Government commissioned various reports such as the Hanly report. Currently in the mid-west it is conducting a survey of what we need in our hospitals. This is another survey costing more money. The Government can dish out money for electronic voting machines, to the horse racing industry and to the GAA. Being a true GAA man myself, I welcome the latter spending. However, the people who need the money are the elderly in this society and the Government is not giving it.I visited a geriatric home in my county last week and met the loved ones of two people in that home who are suffering from the MRSA super bug. One of those patients was in a semi-private ward and the other was in a public ward. When I asked the nurse in charge why those people suffering from this deadly MRSA bug were in public and semi-private wards I was told that they could not put them into a private ward because they did not have one. When I stated that nurses going out for lunch should change out of their uniforms, a nurse came to me and said there was nowhere for them to change unless they did so in the ladies' toilet because there was no staff room. That is the position in St. Joseph's Hospital in Ennis. The Government can proudly state that this is the health service and we are spending money. We are not spending it; we are squandering it.I want the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to visit Ennis again. I stated yesterday evening that the accident and emergency department in Ennis hospital was so crowded a few weeks ago that patients were put in the reception area and no fire or safety measures were in place for the vulnerable people concerned who were unable to care for themselves. Will the Minister of State undertake to come back to visit and see for himself the institutions in Clare, especially the geriatric homes, and compliment the doctors, nurses and staff who give an excellent service in atrociously poor conditions

Many of the Deputies on this side of the House do not get much time to speak and we relish any such opportunity. There is certainly much to say on this issue.The first aspect of this Bill to which I wish to refer is the delay. Other Deputies have spoken about this and I will do so as well. It is 14 months since the Supreme Court rejection. The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, introducing the Bill on Second Stage, stated "It is regretted that, due to the detailed and complex nature of the issues involved and the need to consult with a broad range of agencies and interests, the drafting of this Bill has taken longer than anticipated."At the end of the summer recess my colleague and party leader, Deputy Sargent, in the interests of North-South co-operation and the east-west dimension following the British-Irish Agreement, asked that the House should sit in line with the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, etc. and once again the Government decided to take early holidays. In January, the same occurred. There were two months of legislative time when we could have been working. Unfortunately, we did not get that opportunity. The work could have been done sooner and we could have debated it, but unfortunately time for dealing with such issues is not allocated.I do not accept that it is a drafting issue. It is an issue of trying to find space within the legislative programme to discuss it. The last time we had a chance to speak on the Bill was on 30 March, almost a month ago. That is because of the logjam of legislation and the preponderance of statements on various issues which the Ministers feel compelled to spend a day debating such as yesterday's motion on accident and emergency services by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. That is not good legislative practice or good Government. If we had more time——

#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	149	That is fair enough. I did not request it. I would prefer an opportunity to deal with legislation as well as statements and we do not get that opportunity.I understand that in the old days this House sat until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Perhaps it should return to that practice because, as an Opposition Deputy, I find it difficult to get chances to speak on many of the major issues outside my portfolio. I would welcome such opportunities. I rarely get 20 minutes, as is the case today, to speak on an issue. My point is that, notwithstanding Easter, it is the already the best part of a month since this matter was discussed. If the summer and winter recesses were shortened and brought in line with those of the UK Parliament, we might get business carried out a little more efficiently and would not be seen as a laughing stock by our colleagues across the water.Although every Deputy, myself included, likes to be out working in the constituency, particularly as an election approaches, if I were out at a public meeting or knocking on doors and was told that I would get an opportunity to speak at 11 o'clock at night, I would gladly take it. As it is, I have my chance to speak now. The last time I contributed on this issue was during the debate on the Health (Amendment) Bill in March 2005. I outlined my disgust at the legislation, which was aimed at legalising the charging of elderly patients for their care through pension deductions. While this robbery has been legalised, the legislation concerns repayments to those against whom the robbery was deemed illegal.I welcome the specific generalities of the Bill in that context but I have a number of queries, the first of which relates to the appointment of consultants. Is it a "Harneyism" that outside consultants must be appointed? Is it because of their relationship with big business that the Government parties must go the business route and they will not resource their own staff and teams adequately to address issues? A motivated, properly resourced team comprising officials from the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and other Departments would be more appropriate. Significant amounts of taxpayers' money has been wasted in the past on consultant reports. Consultants will be appointed in this instance to set up a scheme to repay the stolen moneys and, in that context, I welcome the move but is it logical to appoint external consultants? It is not enough to state it is such a complicated issue that consultants are needed. Deputy McManus referred to similar schemes such as that which addressed payments to married women. That was dealt with internally and I do not know why this issue cannot be addressed internally, as it would be more accountable.I am reminded of my efforts to question the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism. More than 50% of the questions I tabled are referred to the Irish Sports Council, the Arts Council and Fáilte Ireland and the problem is such outside bodies are not accountable. Increasingly, the Government cannot be held to account by this Parliament because of the crammed legislative programme and its tendency to pass the buck. In this context, the buck has also been passed and it will be difficult to scrutinise the impact of the legislation when it is enacted.In principle, I agree with the notion of legally reinstating the moneys to families and individuals from whom it was stolen. In March 2005 I stated it was an even greater sin, having known it was illegal and morally unjustifiable, to legalise the robbery. I said half jokingly that the Tánaiste and Minister of Health and Children and the Government were a bunch of robbing hoods and she was the Sheriff of Nottingham robbing from the poor and giving to the rich. The Government needs a few Robin Hoods and perhaps it will introduce fairer distribution in the taxation system rather than allowing high earners to get away scot free following the next election.The people who were robbed contributed to the State's success over the years. Unfortunately, the Minister is not present because, as a constituency colleague, I would love to rub it in. The Progressive Democrats continually raises, as at its conference last weekend, the need to cut taxes. The economic sensibility of further tax cuts can be debated on another day but the Progressive Democrats, under McCreevy's system, has reduced taxes. Some argue it has worked well while others argue if they had opted for the Berlin model, we might have better public transport, health and education systems because revenue would be distributed more efficiently. The relevance of the Progressive Democrats commentary on the tax system and tax cuts is found in the poignancy of the creation of the Celtic tiger because the people who were robbed, who are very elderly or deceased, paid tax at the highest rates. They lived through the Charlie Haughey hairshirt period and the oil crises of 1973 and 1979. Young people do not know what is like to live through a crisis. Our elderly lived through the tough economic circumstances of the 1950s. They tried to benefit from the boom in the 1960s but there was another recession in the 1970s. Their blood, sweat and tears paid for my third level education and paid for young people to travel before returning to live and work in Ireland and earn high incomes. The elderly are being told, however, that they must pay for their health care. The system could have been organised totally differently but the opportunity was not taken.While the lucky few will get their money back, which is welcome, as we go forward, countless thousands of others who paid tax at the highest rates but who are no longer working and are in receipt of a pension have been told their health care is in their own hands and their blood, sweat and tears was in vain. Deputy Durkan is nodding in agreement and I welcome his support because he is slightly older. I can only speak on the basis of the experience of my parents and grandparents, which is not quite the same. It is difficult to put oneself in somebody else's shoes. Any right thinking member of society would say that charging elderly people in nursing homes was daylight robbery. I reiterate my protestations about legalising such charges and I propose a number of alternatives.As education spokesperson, I have pointed out repeatedly that the Government consistently fails to take into account the social and economic costs of its activities. When I raise issues about investment in education, the Minister for Education and Science asks whether I would like investment in special education needs to be cut back to pay for the McIver report or she says she may not roll-out educational welfare officers if class sizes are to be reduced. Investment in education, as highlighted by the High/Scope Perry preschool project, pays for itself. Similarly, preventative health care also pays for itself.I do not know what it is like to be old and infirm but I have dealt with constituents who are. I was contacted by the relative of an 80 year old woman who had been told she would have to wait three years before she would be assessed by an occupational therapist and then she could apply for a grant for a shower unit. I kicked up and, in fairness to the HSE, it was pointed out that whoever spoke to the relative was incorrect and that a person over the age of 80 must only wait a year. Miraculously, because the issue was raised in the House, an occupational therapist slot was found within a few weeks. Politicians blow their own trumpets a great deal and claim this, that and the other but I do not claim I secured that slot for the woman, although some politicians would. However, if the error had not been brought to the attention of the HSE through this House and the media, which embarrassed the Government, that woman would not have her shower unit. I am approaching middle age and I am in the whole of my health. The health care system could be constructed in such a way so that those who get regular exercise and engage in a programme of preventative health care reap the benefits in later years. I am not just talking about the private system of insurance whereby if one engages in exercise, one gets reductions in health care insurance, but the actual health care system itself. Why is there no official scheme for rewarding people who engage in exercise? We have heard much about the medical card for those over 70, but what about some form of incentive for those who go to the gym? I read in Time magazine that the fastest growing age group for fitness and lifestyle issues is the over 60s. There is no reason a person over 60 cannot sweat through exercise as such a person will be healthier and will cost the taxpayer less in the long run. I keep referring to the costs of the system because the Progressive Democrats Party always looks at the bottom line. If we invest in preventative health care, money will be saved down the line.An inter-agency approach needs to be taken by various Departments. For example, some of my constituents are involved in active retirement associations and it has been statistically proven that the more someone is involved, the more likely brain activity will continue and there will be lower instances of illnesses such as Alzheimer's and osteoarthritis. Active retirement associations that get involved in physical and intellectual activities should be applauded and encouraged. However, as staff costs in the vocational education committees rose last year, the charges also rose for retired people who wanted to sign up to art classes and fitness classes and so on. The Minister for Education and Science refused to provide any funding to pay for the increased costs. While some pensioners were able to absorb the cost, others on lower incomes were not so lucky. The threshold for the definition of a senior citizen moved from 55 to either 60 or 65.The adage that the Government has been cutting taxes but getting at us by stealth is also true in respect of the elderly.

They must pay one way or the other and society must pay as a result. If an elderly person is not able to interact with society, that person is more likely to end up in a nursing home. The majority of people over the age of 60 are active and independent. Any financial incentive to encourage people to be active should be followed. Some people will end up in nursing homes and some will need medical assistance, but let us ensure that such assistance is given gratis to people because of the contribution they have made in the past. That is the least they deserve.Older people also make a contribution through part-time work, community employment schemes, voluntarism and even by getting back to work. I know of one individual who worked for 40 years, retired for four years and is now back in full-time work. He enjoys it and is making a very positive contribution. Older people have a huge contribution to make but they are not being valued sufficiently. I would like the Minister to take that on board and to change the system. If the Government will not allow for the proper subsidised treatment of elderly people in nursing homes, then it should at least invest money to create incentives for older people to get involved in activities such as adult education and physical activity. Many people feel isolated and they sometimes do not know what is available, so more money needs to be spent on advertising and creating incentives. If a small amount of money is put forward in these areas, it will save the taxpayer in the long run. Even in Progressive Democrats speak, that makes sound economic sense.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. This problem has existed since the early 1970s and it has been a shambles since then. Almost every political party in this House has been in power and had responsibility for the Department of Health and Children in that time. Since the late 1980s, the political establishment and the Department were aware that the system for charging patients in long-stay institutions was illegal, yet they did nothing about it. Different Ministers from different parties were in charge of the Department, knew this system was illegal and refused to do anything about it. That is a scandal and it will be written about in the years to come because there is adequate information in this story for a bestseller. To add insult to injury, the current Minister brought in a Bill that was deemed unconstitutional. Now we must deal with this Bill.It is time that politicians, especially those who worked in the Department over those years, admit that they have a political responsibility for what happened. They should not try to pass the buck to someone else, be it a civil servant or a Minister of State. The buck stops with the political head of the Department of Health and Children. Every party had members in that Department, they were aware that these charges were illegal, yet they refused to do anything about it. It will go down as a lesson to be learned in the political history of this country.I am astonished by the proposal that some outside agency will arrange for the repayment of these charges at a horrendous cost. A huge amount of resources and public money have already been wasted by this Government on PPARS and €1 million per year is spent on securing and storing the voting machines bought by the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, even though they will never be used. It is now proposed to spend somewhere between €20 million and €50 million — nobody knows the correct figure — on making these repayments. There is adequate expertise in the public service. The Departments of Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs, the HSE and the Revenue Commissioners all have experience in repayment schemes and the knowledge required to do a good job. Once a template is put in place for a scheme of repayments, the process becomes routine. It is a scandal to suggest that we should waste further public money. I would have thought that publicity over the waste of public money would have brought some people to their senses but that obviously has not happened.The people who were effectively robbed by successive Governments and Ministers for Health created today's Celtic tiger. They worked hard and paid their taxes while others ripped off the country. However, they now find themselves being ripped off in their old age. There is no doubt that the 1916 leaders we have been celebrating, such as Pearse and Connolly, who spoke about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, would turn in their graves if they knew of this saga or of the way in which the public has been ripped off. PAYE workers have paid more than their fair share but a golden circle of people in politics and business ripped off the country in the latter half of the 20th century.If we are to resolve this problem, we should address it in its entirety. The Tánaiste and the junior ministers at the Department of Health and Children and the HSE know full well that this Bill only deals with half of the problem and that thousands more elderly people have been forced into private nursing homes. Medical card holders who have requested beds in public institutions have been denied the medical services to which they are entitled. Some years ago, the Ombudsman clearly indicated that this was also illegal and I believe that the Tánaiste and her Department should address that matter in this legislation.Nearly 500,000 people over the age of 65 live in this State, the vast majority of whom can look after themselves or be looked after at home. They do not want to stay in nursing homes or public beds but would prefer to see out their days at home in the company of their families and communities. Between the 1970s and 1980s, when I worked in the health service, and today, much attention has focussed on the provision of community care services. However, the substantial initial costs of providing these services are not being met, even though the investment could bring significant returns.Home help services have, in effect, been reduced in recent years. The maximum home help available to any individual in my area and, I am told, elsewhere in the country, is about one hour per day excluding Saturdays and Sundays, when no help is available. Anyone who believes that people can be looked after at home in their communities on the basis of a diminishing home help service does not live in the real world. Elderly people who come out of hospital and live alone receive one hour per day of help. That level of assistance probably lasts for one month, after which it is further reduced to two or three hours per week at most. Home help services are the key to ensuring that elderly people are able to look after themselves or be looked after at home in their own communities, which in turn would create significant financial savings for the State. However, the will does not exist to provide proper community care services. The laundry and chiropody services which should be provided in the community are non-existent.If elderly people are to remain at home, the way in which carers are supported is vital. Despite improvements in past years, carers have not been properly resourced. The means testing of the carer's allowance is particularly unhelpful in looking after people at home. The fact the carer's allowance will not be paid in addition to the carer's basic social welfare payment means that, for example, a person who is dependent on a spouse's payments gets a carer's allowance of €180 but loses the €120 adult dependent allowance. This amounts to a small payment for caring 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.There should be significant changes to the carer's allowance. It should not be means tested and should be payable in addition to social welfare payments. Further publicly funded elderly beds are necessary too. St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel, which is in my constituency, is a geriatric hospital that provides a fine service. One of its wards, St. Michael's, has the capacity to provide a further 30 elderly beds at a cost of €1 million. The waiting list for that hospital is 176, which means people must wait at least two and a half years for admission. Many on that waiting list will not be alive when they are called. The hospital staff frequently contact relatives of a person on the waiting list only to find the person has died. If we could provide another 30 beds at a minimal cost that situation would be alleviated.I wish to address funding. People will say my suggestions will cost a fortune. They will cost money, but this country is awash with money. There was a €6.7 billion revenue surplus last year and since this Government came to power in 1997 there was a revenue surplus of €39.6 billion. That surplus should be used to provide human services such as health, education, housing and additional gardaí, particularly for community and drug policing. Most of that money is being used to provide roads, bridges and broadband. This is poor economics as everybody knows that capital projects in most, if not all, European countries are, and should be, funded by borrowing. I can hear somebody saying we almost bankrupted the country before by borrowing. However within EU rules we can borrow up to an additional €4 billion a year. When the country was nearly bankrupted before it was due to borrowing for day-to-day expenditure by a previous Fianna Fáil Government.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, which has been much talked about. As the last speaker said it has been ongoing for the last 30 years and has been dealt with by different Ministers, civil servants and health boards. I was a member of a health board in the 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s when this was discussed at health board meetings. I recall the views expressed and it is interesting to look back. Some people who had worked hard all their lives, striven to rear their families, fought hard to eke out an existence in this and other countries, survived high interest rates and illness and suffered much adversity over the years, were referred to an institution when they are no longer able to fend for themselves at the end of their days. There are situations due to the absence of family or different work patterns in which that is the only way they can be accommodated. An interesting debate used to take place when interest rates were in the early 20s that it would be unfair to expect the State to look after people in these situations and that there should be a payment. I have no problem with the payment but the underlying logic was that as long as a person had a house it should be sold and the person's assets liquidated to pay for his or her maintenance in an institution. I often thought how callous and thoughtless people can be. Did they not realise that the day may come when they will find themselves in that situation? Oddly, some of the people who expounded that theory were older then than I am now. I could not understand how thoughtless people were to think that those people, who had worked through hard times and survived should pay the ultimate price by having their houses taken. There were circumstances in which the house was sold over people's heads to pay for their maintenance in an institution. That is a sad reflection on our society then and now.People have spoken on the merits of the Celtic tiger and it is great to know we are among the richest nations. By our deeds we will be judged. When people come to judge us and write about us the way we treat the less well off in our society, our children and our elderly will be the basis on which they will come to their conclusions.Deputy Healy said the payments were illegal. They were not, but no legislation had been provided to facilitate the making of charges. It was identified in the 1980s but nobody had the guts to introduce reasonable legislation. Everybody saw the opportunity to make more money from the system. Let us examine what is happening. I am dealing with a mother and daughter who jointly own the family home. The mother, by virtue of the nature of her illness, is in a nursing home. The subvention for which she qualifies is the paltry sum of €34 per week whereas the weekly charge is €900. The daughter, who is still at work and is the joint owner of the home, has been told that her mother's half of the home must be liquidated and the payments put towards maintenance before any change will take place. That is a disgrace.The bureaucrats who work in the system and who come up with such conclusions and make such decisions should think about their own day, because their own day will come and it will be a sad day if they are treated in such a callous fashion. During the 1980s a senior official in the health services fell into serious bad health and was hospitalised over a period of years. He found himself and his family almost destitute as a result of paying health bills. The wise will tell me that he should have had health insurance. He had insurance but after a certain period of serious bad health that insurance was no longer economical. The wife of the unfortunate man wrote to me to explain the family position to the effect that the family home had been sold and the next stage was the decision whether he would be discharged into private rented accommodation for the short time he still had left to live.Imagine treating a person who had worked in the health services in that fashion. Whatever we might be called — Celtic tigers or otherwise — we have much to answer for in the context of how we have treated some people in this time of wealth and affluence in this so-called caring society, with its aura of how good, giving and caring we are. We have a lot to learn.I welcome the Bill in so far as it deals with the situation. However, if it does not deal with the type of situation to which I have just referred and if reason does not prevail with those who are given the job of making decisions, we are wasting our time. As Deputy Crawford stated, it would be best if the same time and energy were given to medical examinations and accident and emergency services, and the same emphasis were placed on prescribing and on medical cards, as is placed on the interrogation of those who are deemed to qualify or not for an entitlement. It is crazy that we should be impervious to what is going on. We hear daily of the billions of euro that are being spent in the health services but we do not seem to consider carefully where and how they are spent.In recent years I dealt with the case of a constituent who had a serious illness which turned out to be terminal. He was living in conditions which were not ideal and did not have any institutional help. Eventually, he managed to get limited home help but he was then forced to look for an institution that would cater for a person in his situation. This patient required 24-hour, heavy, ongoing nursing care. It took me three weeks of a continuous barrage of telephone calls, letters, parliamentary questions, repeat telephone calls and so on before I eventually had to identify a particular ambulance driver and the personnel involved to chaperone the person into an institution where, unfortunately and due in no way to the excellent care he received, he passed away. If all the time and energy spent in attempting to get accommodation and treatment for the unfortunate man had been devoted to providing the treatment, it would have been much easier and cheaper for all.We are reaching a situation where there are so many preventative barriers to the achievement of the entitlements of various categories of people, especially the ill and elderly, that it is no longer possible to access these entitlements. Many people throw up their hands and decide it is not worth trying and that they will not humiliate themselves by going any further down that route. I know of a family where the father and mother both required care and attention. As no family member was at home or nearby and in a position to provide that care, the parents were lucky enough to get into a nursing home, which cost approximately €1,000 per week. No subvention or other payment was received because the unfortunate people owned their house. That is the sad penalty. They owned their home and it was deemed that it should be liquidated to pay for their upkeep. The husband of the couple passed away and, eventually, the wife was referred to the same institution. It is a repetition of the same old story. I could paper the walls with the letters that went backwards and forwards in that regard.Decisions were made regularly which we knew had no basis in law. Even with the passage of this Bill, I do not know where we will be in a few years because I cannot be sure the situation will change and cannot foresee how it will change. If we are to have the same interrogation and the same treatment of elderly people whose only option is institutional care, then we will not make progress and the degree to which we pride ourselves on our caring society will not add up.Deputy Gogarty reminded me that last week one of the Government parties came out with a unique proposal, which it has not yet achieved but which it obviously intends to carry out, to abolish taxation and provide services. I know there are experts, financial and otherwise, in this House, the country and worldwide but I am sorry to have to suggest that in most democracies attempts to achieve this have failed so far. I presume if we re-examined the theory of gravity and the case of the falling apple, we could qualify the theory in various ways and perhaps disprove it. However, I am interested to know how one part of the Government, the lower end, will prove that it will deliver health and other services with virtually no taxation.If that party is still around at the following general election, it will abolish taxation entirely and pay a premium to the people of the country by and large. Is that not the obvious direction to go? Why not do it?

We live in a time when we cannot provide hospital services, including accident and emergency services, or adequate staffing for medical, surgical or general hospital beds. We cannot provide adequate staffing for schools, the health services generally and local authorities.I would be interested to know where we will be in another four or five years if we continue in this way. Let us not cod ourselves but ask the salient question. For example, when we reduce revenue to the system, let us by all means take full credit, telling everyone that we will ease their burdens. However, let us also tell them that there is a down side to it and that the so-called coping classes referred to in recent weeks also need care and attention, retirement, hospital services and institutions at various times. Let no one forget that all members of Irish society, from whatever social and economic strata, are human. They will all have to rely on the kinds of services about which we are talking, unless they are superhuman.I know that it is not easy to say that we will increase subventions, in which case all the private institutions will up their charges, absorbing the entire benefit. Notwithstanding all that, a means other than that now in use must be found to determine an equitable way of dealing with the extremely vexed situation of subventions and the entitlement that I believe everyone should have, since the notion that those with a property should render themselves homeless before receiving any help is crazy.I know what people will say. For the site of an ordinary house in suburban Dublin, the going rate can now be €1 million to €5 million. However, we are living in cloud-cuckoo land, since that will not continue. No one should be in any doubt about that, and the farther that we go down that road, the nearer we approach the bubble bursting.The Minister of State will remember the person in County Kildare who told me in 1980 — during a Fianna Fáil Government, which makes it worse — that he had lost IR£1 million within the previous 12 months.

I raise that to explain what happened then, something that very few can remember. The price of all property dived overnight for no reason. There were various worldwide fears of oil shortages connected with Iran, and the gentleman said that the value of his property had gone down by IR£1 million in one year. He counted himself lucky to have survived to tell the tale.We must consider what will happen if we continue as at present. I mention that in the context of this legislation, not because I wish to have a swipe at someone but simply because we must realise that, in theory, if one wishes to consider institutional care for someone in the greater Dublin area, he or she has no chance at all if one applies the principle that the person must sell his or her house, and that house is worth €1 million to €5 million. Unfortunately, the reality is that they will not get anything and may as well sell now.The sad part is that many of those people struggled through the 1970s and 1980s, and in the 1990s just about managed to free themselves of debt in the face of very high interest rates. Ultimately, all that we can offer them is an apology that, now that they have lived their lives, struggled, worked hard, and earned their money by the sweat of their brow and paid taxes, we must take from them their houses, which in reality were only lent to them for a short time. I do not believe in that philosophy. The State, particularly when it boasts of less intrusion, should practise that itself.I thought that all the repayments would have been made by now. I am not sure that it was such a great administrative problem. All the records are readily available, and it should not have been necessary to go through so many legal loopholes and wrangles to make the repayments. It should have been possible to work out a simple resolution whereby people were repaid whatever they were entitled to.It would do no harm to remember that in certain situations some will appear to be better repaid than others. We all know that this will ultimately emerge. In those situations, I hope it will not be necessary to go to court to resolve problems, if anyone fails to receive what is a right or entitlement. We would be far better off if attempts were made to resolve the issue without costing the State any more and hope that lessons that should have been learnt over the past 25 years will stand it in good stead and that we will not repeat the mistakes.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I am very pleased at the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It has been spoken of for a long time and was slow in coming before the House, but it is here now to deal with illegal nursing home charges. It shows that the State is willing to take responsibility for its actions and make amends for what it has done.As public representatives, we all deal with the needs and concerns of elderly people daily. We are increasingly concerned about their vulnerability as a group in modern society. Care of the elderly is an issue that often seems to come bottom of any list of priorities. That the present Bill has been necessary shows real concern at the potential exploitation of the elderly, internationally and otherwise.The elderly are very vulnerable for several reasons. One area in which vulnerability manifests itself is older people's capacity to achieve the type of care and accommodation that they want and need to see out their lives. Often the elderly find that they are not listened to nor are their views treated with respect. The dominant factors determining where and how they live become "convenience" and "cost-effectiveness".The 2004 annual report of the Ombudsman pointed to a range of discriminatory practices that elderly people in Ireland must endure daily. The discrimination identified by the Ombudsman extended beyond goods and services and related to a general attitude that the elderly are a burden. The report of the Ombudsman stated:Above all they worry about the increasing tendency in society to view them as redundant and wasteful of resources...One of the most distressing aspects of the A and E crisis, as noted by those who witnessed it, was the fact that those who suffered most were often the elderly, frequently robbed of their dignity as hard pressed and otherwise caring staff nonetheless were forced to carry out certain tests and interventions in public areas of the hospital.Discrimination in the provision of goods and services on grounds of age is illegal under the Equal Status Act 2000, but we must ensure that the law is upheld in this context and that elderly people are aware that they are legally entitled to equality and have avenues to seek redress if their rights are violated.It is a strange way for a country to treat its citizens given that we all aspire to reaching old age. By 2011, it is estimated that people aged 65 and over will represent 14% of the population compared with 12% now. By 2050, that percentage will have risen to 24%. Discrimination on age grounds is not the only obstacle constantly faced by Ireland's elderly population. As many Oireachtas Members who deal with elderly people regularly will say, elderly people are often fearful of what the future holds.My colleague, Deputy Healy, referred to south Tipperary. Many constituents have come to us expressing concern about the future of St. Patrick's Hospital in Cashel. I acknowledge the work of the Tánaiste in bringing to fruition a huge hospital plan for the constituency of south Tipperary which involves Our Lady's Hospital and the now South Tipperary General Hospital. However, there is a real fear among staff, workers and the community at large about the future of St. Patrick's Hospital. It is an old hospital with a great history of looking after the elderly. It is hugely respected because of its work down through the years when people were poor and could not afford to be looked after in their own homes or communities. St. Patrick's Hospital took up that challenge. The pride among the workforce of that hospital in the way it looked after the elderly people in our constituency is recognised by anybody associated with the health service.The downsizing of the hospital would have a detrimental effect on our community. I urge the Minister of State to bring to the attention of the officials of the Department and anybody else concerned with this issue that the people of South Tipperary need not only the continuation of the hospital but its development. There are few hospitals here that have the record of this small hospital in looking after people. It is a flagship and could be held up as an example in any debate on hospitals and looking after the elderly. I urge the departmental officials, the Minister of State and the Tánaiste to take cognisance of what I have said and to highlight the need for this hospital for the people in my constituency.If an elderly person wishes to remain in his or her home, the State must endeavour to facilitate this. A key plank of such an approach would be giving proper value to the important role carers play in our society. In this context, a more flexible approach to the habitual residency clause is needed. I know of one person in South Tipperary who left her job and family in America, came home to look after her elderly mother and was refused the carer's allowance. I have written to the Department and have fought this case. I am extremely disappointed that this woman who left her family and returned here did not get the carer's allowance. The State is now paying a large amount of money to support her mother simply because we could not change the rules in regard to this individual. It is quite unfair and draconian to do this to do somebody while she cared for her mother. I appeal to the Government to consider these people who are quite willing to look after their folks in their homes but because they have lived and have property in another country, they are not looked after.The need to promote the highest standard of professionalism in our hospitals is crucial. Care of the elderly is a specialised area and nursing homes need to be staffed by health care professionals with a knowledge of geriatric health. As many nursing staff as possible should possess a diploma in geriatric nursing. The Health Service Executive needs to inform nursing homes of nursing seminars, up-skilling programmes, etc. These events are taking place but nursing homes are not being adequately notified. That is a very important point. Nursing home proprietors should have incentives for nursing staff to be up-skilled. Non-nursing staff of nursing homes need skills also and these opportunities should be made available to them.Staffing ratios in nursing homes also need attention. Last year the INO repeated its call for a review of staffing levels and conditions of accommodation for older people in public nursing homes and cited some shocking ratios. It is important staffing ratios are determined by the Health Service Executive. Other important areas to be considered in respect of nursing home regulations include the need to give priority to social interaction, nutrition and hygiene, especially dehydration as an older person can become dehydrated in a short period.There are many wonderful nursing homes here and it is unfair that some horror stories can taint the whole sector. The best way to preserve the integrity of the nursing home sector is to ensure the conditions under which a nursing home receives its licence are rigorously enforced. There is a case to be made for creating a new monitoring body to deal with nursing homes, particularly new ones. The Government bears a crucial responsibility in respect of care of the elderly. I hope it takes its role seriously and that this Parliament does everything it can to uphold and value the rights of the elderly. I hope this Bill will go some way to address the wrong done to the elderly by the State over many years and that we will learn from our mistakes and ensure nothing similar to the illegal nursing home charges scandal happens again.The housing aid for the elderly scheme has provided great assistance to many elderly people over the years. Costs have risen dramatically, including oil and energy costs. There is a great need for people to have their homes insulated, particularly the older homes. In next year's budget a massive increase should be given to the housing aid for the elderly scheme. It is crucial and has played a vital role in the quality of life for many people. I urge whatever Department is responsible to take that on board because it is a hugely important scheme providing great benefit to many people.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I am glad to be able to speak now because there is a transition year group, which includes my daughter, in the Visitors Gallery. I hope to have the opportunity to meet them when I finish my contribution. The business of legislating should be complex, involved and considered. There is a particular responsibility on Government before presenting any legislation in this House to illustrate that it has undergone such a process. Unfortunately, the convulsive history of nursing home charges shows that not only this Government but successive ones have failed to tackle this issue properly.I remember being involved in a debate on the Health (Amendment) Act in the final days of the session before the Christmas recess in 2004. All Stages were dealt with on the one day. Despite the many protestations of Members on this side of the House that this was the wrong way to consider the Bill, and that any apparent flaws in it would be shown up quickly, the Government insisted on pursuing this course of action. It was left up to the judicial arm of the State to highlight the exact legislative flaws of the Bill. The lesson that should have been learned is that rushed legislation is never good.Later amending health legislation was given more consideration. However, the time allowed for this was short by comparison to the average time allowed for considering a Bill in the House. The questions that should have been addressed at all Stages of the debate went unanswered. There was a considerable interval between this and the Government's substantial presentation on how it wants to deal with repayments of what are coyly referred to in the explanatory memorandum as "wrongful" nursing home charges, which affected elderly patients in particular.It was somewhat ironic that some weeks after the publication of the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, a second explanatory memorandum was produced with a note of information on the original. It states the original contained a number of errors and that it had been reprinted to correct them. It also stated all copies of the original should be disposed of. If anything is illustrative of the utter cock-up the Government has made of the matter, it is that piece of paper. It indicates a lack of consideration and of appropriate political will to deal with the issue properly.The Government, along with all previous Governments since the mid-1970s, has been indifferent, has prognosticated and has not really wanted to deal with it. However, since court decisions brought it into the open, its response has been hurried and panicky. Ultimately, those who have been affected and who seek proper redress are not being properly served. That said, the issue of repaying nursing home charges is still only a single element of what should be a more comprehensive response as part of the Government's general care policies. The idea that the State sponsors, through the taxpayer, tax reliefs for the creation of private nursing homes and buys bed space in a number of private nursing homes at full market cost to remove those who have been charmingly referred to in the public health system as "bed blockers" indicates the philosophy of the Government and the priority it affords to care. The same emphasis is not placed on care within the home by close relatives, nor is it placed on voluntary care within the community or on supported care through the home-help system.If the amount of State resources or taxpayers' money forgone by the Exchequer in support of what is a health industry were given, in proportion, to those caring within the home, members of voluntary organisations and those supporting semi-supported care through the home help system, the nature and scale of the problems in private nursing homes would not even begin to become as pronounced as they now are. The Government is not interested in the holistic approach I advocate. It wants a quick reaction to dig itself out of a hole of its own making. This approach will not be of any long-term benefit to the mainly elderly people who have suffered as a consequence of the Government's lack of thinking and foresight and its general lack of policy.Some years ago, the home help scheme in the then Southern Health Board area was run by individuals who were more or less voluntary in most aspects of their work. The rate paid by the health board was 50p per hour. At the same time, the State was adopting an approach involving private business ventures and the use of taxpayers' money which did not necessarily meet the care needs of many thousands of citizens.If we are serious about having a proper care environment for all citizens, a Bill of this type should consider these wider issues. It should certainly address the care environment in which many find themselves in private nursing homes, which are often situated miles from anywhere and certainly miles from the communities from which the patients hail. This lack of connection and ongoing community support is such that many are forced to live their final years with a quiet indignity because the State and their communities have somehow given up on them.Circumstances could be so different. This Saturday, in what is my constituency but which because of redrawing will unfortunately become part of Cork North-West in the next general election, I will have the opportunity to attend an awards night at the Westgate Foundation centre in Ballincollig. It is a centre of excellence for the care of elderly people. It is such because of its integrated approach. It marries all the elements I have described and has a large number of voluntary service providers and paid and specialist staff. It receives some funding from the Health Service Executive and also from other State bodies, it has adopted a community outreach approach and people use its services on a myriad of levels. Some use it as a day service centre for social outreach or for health care needs and others attend for long-term care. A community of elderly people has chosen to live in a retirement village at the centre and it comprises volunteers and support workers as much as anything else, yet Government funding is not such that the centre is being recognised as a benchmark for the provision of other such centres throughout the country.The Westgate Foundation had an opportunity to locate another centre in Macroom, approximately 20 miles from Ballincollig. Lynch's Lodge Hotel, which was bought by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the OPW for a sum of €4.5 million to accommodate asylum seekers and refugees, was subsequently deemed unsuitable for this purpose. The organisation behind Westgate made an attempt to acquire the premises to develop a second centre for a new cohort of people in the mid-Cork area. Unfortunately, the State agencies' approach, involving the Health Service Executive, the OPW and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, did not make the premises available but put it back on the market and sold it for €3.5 million. During the biggest property boom the country has ever experienced, a building on which the State had already spent €1 million could have been used for productive, care-giving purposes to benefit the community. That this was not done was all too indicative of an inadequate Government response to care provision.The Minister of State represents the larger party in the coalition. I have given up attaching any care-giving qualities to the junior partner in the coalition. I hope that someone in the background of the Minister of State's party would at least be concerned, troubled, prepared to ask questions about and make changes to the current policy, but unfortunately I do not get that sense. The priority that could and should be given to this area is not given because it is deemed that the people most affected are those least likely to vote, who are least likely to have a political voice and are not likely to change political configurations in this Chamber for future Governments. It is a damning indictment of any representative in this jurisdiction that the generation that helped to develop the State and brought us to the degree of prosperity we now enjoy is being treated so shabbily.The Bill could have been broadened and given more meaning for the wider population regarding care in the family setting. As people in nursing homes have their capital assets assessed and the income of their sons and daughters is also assessed, it means that out of necessity many people's health needs can only be met in their family homes. The State offers a bandage solution to meeting the needs of many such people through the home help system. Despite the Government's promises of increased funding, the personal experience of Members of the House is that this is being spread ever more thinly as the population grows older and hours are taken from individual elderly people and given to new applicants to the scheme rather than properly resourcing it.The greatest neglect in State resources and the need for support relate to family care cases. I have spoken in the main about the elderly as this legislation largely addresses them. I could as easily talk about those in long-term health care and those with disabilities. A woman in my constituency has an adult daughter with spina bifida. In the past her accessing the available State resources in terms of direct funding, services or materials needed entailed being exposed to a regime whereby special nappies needed by her daughter were subsequently weighed in their soiled state to determine whether that woman and her adult daughter were entitled to additional funding. That situation has only arisen in recent years. Our health and social welfare systems are still riddled with such anomalies.People are trying to live ordinary lives with an additional burden thrust upon them. The State chooses to stay out of cases where it is most needed while at the same time uses taxpayers' money to buy beds in private nursing homes and support those who are only involved in the care business in terms of the commercial imperative it offers them. This is most readily seen in the decision of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to support a private care agency, called "care givers". If anything sums up the Progressive Democrats approach to care giving, the need for people to get care and how that service should be provided, it is the attitude that it can be reduced in every circumstance to euro and cent. As long as we have an attitude that the problem can be solved through finance and not through other forms of support and acknowledgement, the type of legislation circus in which we have been involved since the first Health (Amendment) Bill was presented in the House will continue.The Government's majority determines that the Bill will be passed. However, the Government cannot have any certainty that it will not be open to subsequent challenge, judicial review and change. Such a scenario is more likely than not because the Government failed to take the opportunity to be considerate and involve itself in addressing all the complexities of the issue. When we go to the doorsteps and meet individual carers the Government will get a very resounding answer about its callous and indifferent approach to the issue.

There is no need to revisit the debate as to who knew what or when. This matter has been not only discussed in this House but was also dealt with extensively in the media. Obviously, the Civil Service was also involved. I am delighted that the repayments will commence in June. The key point is that those who had pension or other payments deducted illegally must be repaid promptly. Many of these people are elderly and some may be mentally infirm and could even be wards of court. All Members agree that there must be no more delay with these repayments. It is a complex issue and I understand that a public procurement process must be followed. On behalf of my constituents who may have been affected I urge the Government to ensure that there is no further delay with the scheme.I am delighted with the introduction of the private patient accounts, which is well overdue. It was remiss of all of us not to have considered in the past how pension and other social welfare payments would be handled in the case of those who are elderly or infirm. That issue can and will be fully addressed with private patient accounts.This should be the first stage of a debate on care for senior citizens at a time in their lives when they may not be able to care for themselves. We need to do more to support households, not just carers, but also families. Most elderly people would prefer to either stay on their own in their own house or live with their family in, for instance, a granny flat. I have considerable experience in dealing with elderly people in my area. Most of them do not want institutionalisation, which should be regarded as a last step. We all know how expensive it is. I urge the Minister of State to review this area. It is much more expensive to have people in residential care than it is to have them in the community. I also pay tribute to the many voluntary groups which support the elderly, not only in the community but also by offering house visits. Some of the groups have had difficulties with their budgets, although most of them are being looked after. It is not good enough that many of them have to spend weeks or months scraping the barrel, contacting their local public representatives and making sure their finances are in order. I am calling for a guaranteed roll-over payment to be issued to all community groups which assist and support the elderly in their homes, in day care centres or in community groups.I welcome this Bill, which will undoubtedly place a large strain on the Exchequer. A sum of €1 billion has been mentioned. The Army deafness cases were spread out over several years, but the payments in this instance cannot be spread out over several years. We have to face our responsibilities quickly and without any encumbrance. As many of the people in question are elderly, I would like a clear timeframe to be set out for the payments. If the payments start in June of this year, I respectfully suggest we should aim to complete the disbursement of all the moneys within a year.I thank my friend, Deputy O'Connor, for giving me some leeway. This matter should be referred for ongoing monitoring to the relevant Oireachtas committee, which should receive monthly progress reports on the disbursement of these moneys, all of which should be disbursed within a year, if possible. I welcome the Bill.

The constituency of Dublin South-West, which I represent, is generally accepted as having a young population. There are more than 26,000 young people at school in Tallaght, which is the third largest centre of population in the country. Although Tallaght has a young population, it is an aging population. The challenges of the aging population are presented acutely in many areas, including the area that is so ably represented by my colleague, Deputy Mulcahy. I know the Minister of State understands the challenges we face.I often say that I bring to politics my experiences and those of my constituency. I have been contacted by, and received some correspondence from, my constituents about the issue of repayments to the elderly, which is of concern to many people. Some Members will be aware that Tallaght, despite what I said about the profile of its population, is lagging behind in its provision of nursing home accommodation. It is clear that this matter will have to be examined by the planners in the Department of Health and Children and the HSE. Elderly women in the Tallaght community have been cared for in St. Brigid's home at Crooksling in Brittas, which does a tremendous job, for quite some time. Kiltipper Woods care centre on the Kiltipper Road in Tallaght, which was developed recently, is a tremendous facility that offers a tremendous service to the local area.I have often mentioned that many constituents contact me to highlight the need for accommodation for the elderly, which is an issue that upsets people. I have encountered similar circumstances in my family, for example when an elderly uncle went to a nursing home when he was no longer able to cope. He was very happy at the nursing home, even though it was in Bray, which is a long way from his local area of Iveagh Buildings in the inner city. He thought he was a long way from home. Many of my constituents continue to speak to me about nursing home needs and facilities.Members are aware that I live within sight of Tallaght Hospital, which faces many challenges. I spoke about Tallaght in a positive way during the debate on accident and emergency services in the House earlier this week. I referred to the challenges which are faced by Tallaght Hospital, like many other hospitals in the region. The number of beds in Tallaght Hospital relates to the provision of care for the elderly in the area. Families are encountering challenges, as far as people in beds are concerned, in Tallaght Hospital, St. James's Hospital and all the other hospitals in the Dublin region.I would like to be associated with the comments of Deputies who spoke positively about the home help scheme. I remind the Minister of State that it is important that we understand the merits of the scheme. A very successful home help project in Tallaght is run by the Tallaght Welfare Society, of which I am a board member as a volunteer. The project employs 150 home help workers, who care for more than 450 elderly people. I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that such projects represent the way forward at a time when there is a great deal of pressure on our hospitals and facilities. I strongly believe the way forward is to care for people at home, for example by helping them to be comfortable and safe in their homes and offering a great deal of support and assistance, which is what they want. I hope it is something we will continue to consider as we make progress.I want to refer briefly to practices in nursing homes, specifically to a practice I recently raised with the Department which is being examined by the HSE. I have to be careful when speaking about it, as I do not know how widespread it is. I have been told that the pension books of elderly people who are in public beds in nursing homes are being retained in some cases. Family members of some elderly people have raised this issue with me because they are wondering about the legality of the practice. They do not know whether the practice is allowed. It is right that an issue of this nature should be raised during this debate. I hope the Department will tease it out.I heard the Tánaiste speaking about the former health boards. I do not normally disagree with her. I was a member of the former Eastern Health Board from 1994 and the founder chairman of the former South-Western Area Health Board, which was based in Naas. That was my background for over ten years. While the former structures were not quite right in some respects, I felt there was some merit in the system whereby representatives of health boards visited various institutions, particularly nursing homes. The Tánaiste has said she does not want public representatives to check systems etc., and perhaps that is fair enough. This debate raises the question of accountability of public and private nursing homes. If public representatives do not have an opportunity to visit some of these institutions under the HSE structures, as they did under the health board structures, to see what is going on, some other sort of system needs to be put in place. I do not suggest that the system whereby public representatives visited the institutions was perfect, as that was clearly not the case, but it did a job. I have listened to people raising concerns during this debate and I am sure many more concerns will be raised. I am not criticising the industry in so far as that is concerned. However, there is a need for accountability and the Department needs to find out what is going on. There have been a number of well publicised cases in recent times where questions have been raised in that regard. The Minister of State will understand that people have questions to ask. The public would like to see better accountability as regards nursing homes which are earning very good money in caring for the elderly, and perhaps he might look at that.The public is very anxious that this issue should finally be put to bed. I do not want to be too party political in front of my good colleague, Deputy Perry, but Fianna Fáil has been responding to the needs of the elderly over a very long period. It is only right that successive Governments should do that. I am proud that at the end of this year the next budget will affirm the Government's absolute commitment to looking after the elderly. As regards pensions, our targets from the previous general election will be well met. I hope this is something that will continue.At this morning's conference on lone parents in Farmleigh I made the point that there are another 400 days or thereabouts before a general election, or so it is said. Many issues will be raised and certainly health will be one of them. Future provision and care for the elderly merits pride of place among all the important issues requiring our attention in the lead-up to the general election. I hope people will not be vying with each other to decide what will be offered in terms of election promises. The elderly deserve the support they receive from the political system, and that is as it should be. As the number of elderly people — including many of us in this Chamber — grows over the next decade or so, it is important that we continue to do that.Many public representatives have been asked by different organisations and committees about the delay in introducing the legislation. It is important to recall that following the Supreme Court decision in February 2004, the Department understood that a number of implications had to be dealt with. The judgment required detailed consideration to ensure that all the consequences for policy and law arising from it were taken on board in a positive and responsible manner. We now know that a Cabinet sub-committee was formed to consider all the implications of the decision, especially the issue of a repayments scheme to repay the moneys owed.The Government announced in May the key parameters of the repayments scheme that had been agreed. It was deemed that legislation was required, given the scale of the repayments involved and because some of the recipients were among the most vulnerable people in society. Legislation was also required to put appropriate safeguards in place to prevent fraud and the exploitation of those who receive the repayments and who are not in a position to manage their financial affairs. That is an important point, as has been stressed by many groups and organisations. I hope these repayments will go to the people who deserve them and that the moneys are not spent on administration.Legislation is also required to ensure that those applying for refunds receive them as soon and as expeditiously as possible. My colleague, Deputy Mulcahy, made a suggestion which I support. While I do not want to tie anyone up in bureaucracy, as the Government convenor on the Joint Committee on Health and Children, I agree that it has a role to play in monitoring the situation and in keeping an eye out for the public interest. I am a strong supporter of the Oireachtas committee system. It is very important that it is used properly. Sometimes we read in the media that the Dáil is on holidays yet again. It is not pointed out, however, that many of our colleagues attend joint committee meetings, as was the case last week and this week again. The Joint Committee on Health and Children is one of the busier forums in that regard.I am pleased to note that the simplified applications process was an aspect the Government chose to concentrate on to ensure it was as user-friendly as possible. I am also glad that the Tánaiste took account of the need to ensure that adequate provisions were in place for the project. It is clearly significant legislation and this is an important debate. It is not a question of rubber-stamping matters, but I hope the Bill will be passed and implemented as quickly as possible.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I am delighted to speak on this very important issue. It is great to see the legislation before the House, finally, since I broke the story initially on the issue of entitlement and the illegality of the deductions. Uncertainty as regards refunds to elderly people caught up in the nursing home care scandal and their families and how they will be repaid has been put to rest. That is certainly a good thing.Some €1 billion will be paid to 20,000 people living in nursing homes who are directly in line for a refund and between 40,000 and 50,000 estates of those who died before their losses could be made good. Many of the people concerned were concerned that the refunds would be taken into account in future assessments of their social welfare and pension benefits. However, the Bill clearly states that in the case of living individuals the payments will be exempt from income tax and will not be taken into account when means testing benefits. That is very significant.Of significance, too, is the fact that the modest State pensions of ladies and gentlemen in public nursing homes will no longer be raided to pay for their keep. No more than €120 a week out of the total pension of €193.30 will be withheld. At least patients occupying public beds will have a sense of independence. That is a major achievement and it is certainly needed.We need more public beds to be made available for nursing home patients so that fewer people will have to liquidate all their assets to pay for private care, which is a commonplace occurrence. Fantastic facilities are available in Sligo in Ballymote, St. John's Hospital in Sligo town, Nazareth House and quite a number of private nursing homes which have State beds within them. Those are excellent facilities. Given the difficulties in the large public hospitals with people bed-blocking in some regions while space is available in private nursing homes, it is a pity that people cannot be moved into them, perhaps for periods of respite. The State should deploy more public beds in private nursing homes as well.Unfortunately many people are not in a position to pay for private nursing homes. The subvention system is inequitable. Families in Sligo, for example, may have to pay twice as much as their counterparts in Dublin to keep loved ones in nursing homes. Nursing home fees can amount to €700 or €800 per week and discretion is given regarding subvention rates in the Dublin region. If a person in a nursing home is paying a fee of €800 per week, for example, after the subvention rate and pension the family may only have to pay up to €200 in Dublin but a family in Sligo will have to pay €400 for a facility that costs the same in Sligo, which is twice as much as Dublin. This is yet another case of Government bias towards the Dublin region and blatant discrimination towards the western sea coast. Families in Sligo have to pay hundreds of euro in additional fees. Because of this there are empty beds in many nursing homes in the north west due to the unfair rate of subvention. This matter must be examined.A case was brought to the High Court in regard to nursing home charges for people with medical cards and the Government was forced into repaying this money. The Minister guillotined the Bill in 2004 which meant she fully intended only giving everybody a once-off payment of €2,000 with no intention of making it retrospective. At least the legislation now proposes to go back six years. The big issue goes back prior to the last general election and the decision to give everybody aged over 70 a medical card, regardless of means. The Health Act 2001 established the entitlement of people and showed the State was clearly wrong in deducting charges from people who had a full medical card.Equally, another case is pending in regard to elderly medical card holders who have been forced into private nursing homes where they are paying top fees. A case is currently being taken on this issue. The families of those patients who have been forced to resort to private nursing home accommodation intend to challenge the Government in court on this matter. When this case is overturned the €1 billion which has been referred to may appear small in comparison with the possible level of claims.Likewise, there may be claims from people who sought a contract bed. Age Action Ireland is fighting this case as well. There are cases where people over the age of 70 with full medical card entitlements had sought contract beds but, in spite of their entitlement to them, were forced to go to private nursing homes. They will have a justifiable case to take. There is no ambiguity about the entitlement that goes with having a medical card. I suspect that when this case is being decided before the courts a similar decision could be taken as when the Supreme Court decided in favour of the people who were illegally charged. People are now being paid back retrospectively up to a period of six years.Having pushed this case is one of the political achievements in which I take great pride. It was fantastic that the Supreme Court upheld this judgment and brought the Government to task on this issue. One must remember that if the Government had its way, it would only have paid a once-off amount of €2,000 with one day's retrospection from the date in December 2004 when the Tánaiste introduced the emergency legislation, which went to the Supreme Court and proved to be unconstitutional. The President, Mrs. McAleese, would not sign into law the Tánaiste's legislation.If the Tánaiste had her way none of this money would be paid back. It is important to put this on record, in addition to the fact the President would not sign the legislation into law and that it subsequently went to the Supreme Court which upheld that decision and resulted in the State having to make retrospective payments for a period of six years. It is regrettable it has taken so long to pay back this money despite the fact that within a week the Tánaiste could pay it instantly when she thought there would only be a once-off payment.A total of 10,000 patients were paid a once-off payment of €2,000, which amounted to €20 million. It has been said that the delay to date is due to the fact this is complicated legislation. I have no doubt it is but what is now required is that the process should not be unduly drawn out in light of the fact the recipients of this money are elderly. The matter should be dealt with decisively. I hope the payments will start as quickly as possible.A number of anomalies arise. Dealing with the estates of deceased patients will give rise to a number of difficulties. This was brought to my attention by a constituent in Sligo. He contacted the Tánaiste with regard to situations where people die intestate. He was concerned about the mechanism for the disposal of repayments due to those who died intestate. He wrote:I think all will agree that this is a unique situation, requiring unique legislation. Notwithstanding the terms of the Succession Act, I am sure our legislators can draft particular legislation to deal with the disposal of repayments to those who died intestate. In virtually every such case the reason the deceased failed to make a will was that they were unaware they had any assets. [That would be the case.] Therefore, there is an onus on the Government to endeavour to right this wrong in so far as it can.Perhaps the legislation could include some, or all, of the following with regard to the disposal of such repayments:1. The onus be on a claimant to register their claim.2. A time limit within which a claim must be registered.3. In addition to their relationship to their deceased, the successful claimant(s) be required to prove they had regular personal contact with the deceased in (say) the five years prior to the death of the deceased and/or had financially supported the deceased in some way during their time in the nursing home. (This would disallow claims from relatives — close or distant — who had no contact with the deceased in many years, if ever).4. Where there are two or more claimants, a body be established to decide the wishes of the deceased based on the grounds of probability, and the decisions of that body to be final.In this particular case the patient at St. John's died in his 93rd year and clearly the probate could take years. It is disappointing to see all the possible gain lost in legal fees and searching for extended family members. I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, will take on board the problems in regard to people who have not made a will and die intestate. The onus is clearly on the Government to draft legislation that will deal effectively with the possibilities of making those payments. This situation will demand careful consideration as up to €20 million will be paid out in Sligo and the north-west region alone.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2, together.Since I took the decision to publish crime statistics on a quarterly basis at the beginning of 2003, I have consistently emphasised that care must be taken in interpreting the statistics, especially when considering short term fluctuations or extrapolating trends over short periods. I have emphasised this both when the level of crime has decreased, as it has in the majority of quarters since 2003, and when it has increased, as it did in the last quarter.First, I wish to refer to the long-term crime trends. The level of headline crime in 2005 was actually lower than that for 2003 by 1.6% and for 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore in 1995, when we had a population of almost 3.6 million, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population — 15% of crimes less per 1,000 of the population in 2005 compared with 1995. To put this in context, during the two full years of the rainbow coalition Government, with a population of 600,000 fewer than at present, the headline crime figures were as follows: 1995 — 102,484; 1996 — 100,785, a rate of over 500,000 crimes for a five year Government at a time when our population was much lower than now.The figures for the first quarter of 2006 paint a mixed picture. Of the 25 headline offence categories, 13 showed decreases and 12 recorded increases. Furthermore, there was an increase of 8% in the overall figure for the quarter compared with one year previously. This increase is less than that for the last quarter of 2005, when it was 10%.Crimes against property account for the majority of the increase in headline crime for the first quarter. I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that he has instructed the regional Garda commissioners and divisional chief superintendents to devise and implement strategies in their areas to target, track down and bring to justice persistent offenders. Furthermore, I have made available a further €10 million to the Garda Commissioner for special Garda operations tackling specific forms of crime including burglaries and other offences.Murder and manslaughter is up by three in the first quarter, from a total of nine to 12.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	171	It has gone from seven to 12.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	172	No. One of the problems is that homicide offences had risen but this term includes verbal threats to kill. While no level of murder is acceptable, I would advise the Deputies that Ireland has one of the lowest murder rates in the western world. For example, the homicide rate in Glasgow, a city of comparable size to Dublin, is 5.5 per 100,000 of the population. The comparable figure for Dublin in 2005 is 1.7 per 100,000 of the population. Deputies Howlin and O'Keeffe will be interested to learn that the rate of murder and manslaughter in Ireland in 1995 was 1.47 per 100,000 of the population. The comparative figure for 2005 is 1.41 per 100,000 of the population.The combined total of murders and manslaughters for each year since 1995 is as follows:1995 = 531996 = 461997 = 531998 = 511999 = 472000 = 562001 = 582002 = 582003 = 532004 = 452005 = 58There have been significant reductions in the quarter in all but one of the five sexual crime categories, which show an overall decrease of 36%. In particular, there have been significant decreases in the offences of sexual assault, down 42%, unlawful carnal knowledge, down 32% and rape of a female, down 20%.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.There has been an increase in detections of possession of firearms, up 8%. Increases in possession offences are overwhelmingly due to police detection work. There has also been a reduction in the offence of discharging a firearm, down8%. Operation Anvil has contributed significantly to these encouraging developments. The most recent figures available to me show that since the introduction of Operation Anvil one year ago next month, more than 500 firearms have been seized, which has a corresponding effect on the level of use. To date, Operation Anvil has resulted in more than 2,300 arrests for serious crimes, including murder and serious assault. The operation is being extended and strengthened. Following my request to the Garda Commissioner, it has been extended nationwide this year. This has already resulted in a number of arrests, the seizure of a substantial quantity of drugs and ammunition and the targeting of criminals who travel to parts of the country outside the Dublin metropolitan region to commit burglaries and other offences. It has resulted, for example, in the arrest of a number of persons from west Dublin in the Garda southern region for a number of residential burglaries and the arrest of a person in the south eastern region for a series of burglaries who had recently been released from prison in the UK.Initiatives under Operation Anvil are ongoing and focused on what is most required. They are monitored closely by senior Garda management in the light of crime trends at divisional level. In addition, the Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the organised crime unit at the national bureau of criminal investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity. Enforcement by the unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.I am determined that disturbing trends will be addressed and, despite an increasing population, we should continue to enjoy relatively low crime rates. I am particularly concerned at the increase in the level of murders. While the detection rate for murders remains in general high, the rise in gangland killings and the lower level of detection for them remains a cause of concern. I note that no cases of manslaughter were recorded for the quarter.High on the Government's list of policing priorities for 2006, which has been incorporated into the Garda Síochána policing plan for the year, is the continued targeting of organised crime, including drug trafficking, and the gun culture associated with it through the use of specialist units and targeted, intelligence-led operations. Garda strategies are in place for dealing with drug offences which are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs. These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies both within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national and international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution. These strategies continue to result in operational successes.While it is the case that a number of the increases in headline crime statistics reflect increased enforcement activity on the part of the Garda Síochána, the overall picture indicates there absolutely is no room for complacency. The Government's decision to continue to devote unprecedented resources to the fight against crime shows that it is not complacent, as does my insistence that those resources be deployed at the front line of policing in the State.The Garda Síochána this year has the highest level of resources in its history — €1,290 million — an increase of €146 million or 13% on 2005 and over 100% on 1997. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is €83.5 million, an increase of €23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase is greatly assisting the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The €83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.Implementation is well advanced of the Government's decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006 and 14,000 attested gardaí in two years' time. The Commissioner is now deciding how to distribute and manage these additional resources in the areas where they are most needed. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the first group of newly attested gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested gardaí will come on stream every 90 days from here on in.The decreases in the two categories of robbery of cash and goods in transit and robbery of an establishment or institution, down 38% and 7% respectively, are encouraging. However, recent events have highlighted that a radical lapse in standards has occurred. It had been intended that the Private Security Authority would introduce licensing of the cash movement sector at the end of a voluntary compliance period where the industry would be given time within which to bring its standards up to the requisite approved standards, which would form the basis for licensing. As a result of recent developments, however, the chief executive of the authority has advised me that she will bring forward proposals for the introduction of mandatory licensing of this sector as quickly as possible. Regulation of the cash in transit sector is only one aspect of the functions of the authority which was established to regulate the entire private security industry. These include licensing companies and persons providing a whole range of security services. The authority has already commenced licensing contractors providing private security services in the door supervisor and security guarding areas as well as licensing for suppliers and installers of intruder alarms.The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. It addresses such matters as the preservation of crime scenes, increased periods of detention in the case of arrestable offences, a general power of search in relation to all arrestable offences and also powers for the Garda Síochána to issue search warrants in circumstances of urgency. The Bill also contains amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act 1990, provision for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain lesser public order offences and the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements.It is widely acknowledged that our legislative provision for tackling crime, especially serious and organised crime, is already one of the toughest in Europe. Nevertheless, I have brought forward a range of proposed additions to the Bill. Key proposed additions include the creation of criminal offences in relation to organised crime, the strengthening of provisions on the imposition of the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking, new offences of supplying drugs to prisons, provisions for the establishment of a drug offenders register, provisions to deal with anti-social behaviour; provision to deal with the Supreme Court decision that a judge could not issue warrants if he or she was outside his or her district, new provisions to allow the courts to suspend or partially suspend or to adjourn sentences on conditions which will motivate the offender to stay away from crime, such as participation in drug treatment programmes and provision to allow for restriction of movement orders including electronic monitoring.Furthermore, because of my concern about firearms in general and in order to ensure public safety and security, I propose to bring forward a wide range of amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925-2000 in the context of the Bill. Included in these new proposals are measures which will require all persons wishing to legally hold a firearm to satisfy the Garda that they have provided secure accommodation for the firearm; allow the Minister to deem certain firearms as "restricted" by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre, action type and muzzle energy of the firearm — in future any person wishing to obtain a certificate for such a firearm will have to apply directly to the Garda Commissioner; introduce new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as "sawing-off" a shotgun; increase fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts; create mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.I also intend to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, and thus enable the Garda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders.Furthermore a comprehensive package of proposals on juvenile justice issues has been brought forward as Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill by my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children. The enactment of this Bill is a top priority and I hope to see it on the Statute Book by the summer.I assure Deputies that the legal, operational measures and resources in place to tackle crime are kept under continuing review and any further measures and resources which are required will be made available.I assure the House that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review, and I will continue to do all in my power to maximise the level of resources available to the Garda Síochána.I have set out in tabular format the percentage changes in indictable-headline crime, 1995 to 2005.YearFrequencyPopulationCrime Rate per 1000% Change on 1995% Change on 1996% Change on 1997% Change on 1998% Change on 1999% Change on 2000% Change on 2001% Change on 2002% Change on 2003% Change on 2004% Change Year on Year1995102,4843.5m2901996100,785-2-2199790,875-11-10-10199885,627-16-15-6-6199981,274-21-19-11-5-5200073,276-29-27-19-14-10-10200186,633-15-14-51718182002106,4153.9m27461724314523232003103,3604m26131421274119-3-3200498,9644m24-3-2916223514-7-4-42005101,7124.1m24-111219253917-4-233It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995 with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. To put this in context, during the two full years of the rainbow coalition Government, with a population of 600,000 less than at present, the headline crime figures were as follows: 1995, 102,484 and 1996, 100,785.The figure for 1999 refers to January to September only because of the introduction of PULSE. Figures for the years 2000 onwards reflect enhancements to the compilation of statistics due to the introduction of PULSE. The figures for 2005 are provisional only.

How can we expect a solution from the Government unless he accepts there is a problem? For all his bluster and bravado, does he not agree, now that he is in his fourth year as Minister and with his term nearly over, that crime is worse than ever? I refer to the figures over the nine years the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has been in office. In 1998, the first full year, the crime figure was 85,000 and last year the figures smashed 100,000 for the 12 months. The quarterly figures show an increase of 71% in murder and homicide, a 22% increase in robberies from the person and a 25% increase in thefts from vehicles.Will the Minister accept that his legacy is that the crime rates are up, the detection rates are down over the same period I mentioned, from 44% to 35%, and the public are living in fear of their lives? Will he not agree that unless he is prepared to accept there is a problem, there will be no solution under this Government? I have to suggest to the Minister that he is all tongue and no teeth, he promises a lot and delivers little. He talks tough and achieves virtually nothing. Will he agree that he will not solve crime with his tongue? He must provide the resources that were committed and promised in the past. He has not done so and until that is done, we will not tackle the crime problem. If he does not do so, the next Government will provide those resources.

It is fascinating that every time we discuss the record of the parties opposite, they start shouting.I remind the Deputies that when they were in office the numbers of gardaí in the force declined, whereas while I have been in office and while the two parties have been in office, the numbers of gardaí have dramatically increased. The size of the Garda Síochána budget has gone up from approximately €590 million to €1.3 billion in the lifetime of the Government of these two parties and during my stewardship it has gone up by39%. The Garda Síochána has never been better resourced and never been better equipped. It is achieving results which are very good in general terms. The crime rate per 100,000 of the population is down. The number of murders, compared with when Deputy Howlin was at the Cabinet table, is down per 100,000 of the population. Compared with Glasgow, Ireland has a crime rate and a murder rate which is significantly less——

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I returned relatively recently to this brief and I started by accepting the figures which were e-mailed to me by the Minister, but he has already contradicted them. He stated that the murder rate is up by three. The figure sent to me shows that the number of murders, not manslaughter or homicide, is up from seven to 12, which is 71%, and that is contained in the Minister's press release. I will be more jaundiced in dealing with the Minister's figures from now on because it is clear they cannot be accepted at face value. The Minister whistles past the graveyard. He always has somebody else to blame.I have some direct questions for the Minister. His predecessor asserted that the judgment of the people in how safe they felt would be the criterion by which the success of the Administration dealing with crime was to be judged. That was the litmus test set by his predecessor. On that basis, would the Minister accept that the most recent opinion poll, published on 22 March last, showed that 85% of the public are concerned about crime and public disorder which was the number one issue, that just 5% of the people believe the level of crime has fallen which the Minister has tried to assert yet again, and that, irrespective of statistics he uses to bamboozle people, they know full well that murder is becoming a regular occurrence and that life has been devalued under his stewardship and that of his immediate predecessor?Every time there is a damning indictment of the Minister's stewardship, he flies a new kite. His latest one is that we need to again tighten the bail regime. Does he accept that the bail regime was tightened by referendum under the stewardship of the rainbow Government of which he is now so disparaging, and that was effective? Despite his smokescreen of last week, does he accept that the Garda figures in 1994, which are the ones in advance of the referendum, showed that the Garda believed that 9% of crimes were committed by those on bail and the most recent figures from the 2004 Garda annual report show that only 5% were committed by those on bail? Contrary to the Minister's assertion that the courts are not implementing the Act subsequently——

Will the Minister set the record straight on that and take some responsibility for his and his predecessor's eight years of stewardship in this coalition?

I have also invited them in for more detailed discussions on the Garda Commissioner's proposals on the recruitment, training, powers, duties and deployment of reserve members. The chief superintendents have already come in for one such discussion and, as the House will be aware, the superintendents' association has backed the proposal but has stated that it wants to be consulted as well, and it will be. I am grateful for the very helpful comment it made. I expect to discuss the matter with the superintendents next week.I commend these associations for their positive attitude to the proposals, and I hope that both the GRA and the AGSI will see the value in now engaging in consultations. My door is open. I have made clear that, subject only to respecting the will of the Oireachtas on the establishment of a reserve, I am genuinely open to any constructive proposals on the recruitment, training, powers, duties and deployment of reserve members and I want to hear the views of the associations on those matters rather than simply a sterile argument on points of principle. I reiterate they have the opportunity to help shape the role of the reserve and I urge them to seize that opportunity.It was a pleasure to go to the AGSI conference recently and to be allowed to address it. I noted that the rank and file members present were divided, approximately 50-50, in support for the position which was so strongly articulated by their executive. It was the executive's vote that swung the day.Although I may not get the same opportunity with the GRA, I will keep my door open and I intend to publish the regulations in draft form——

I look forward to engaging with the committee, and the committee may well take the opportunity to hear a variety of different views on the proposals.I recently commissioned research into the public's attitude to crime and law enforcement, and I was particularly pleased, but not at all surprised, at the strong level of public support this indicated for a Garda reserve, with 73% of respondents in favour.The Oireachtas has decided that there should be a Garda reserve and the public strongly support this. The Garda Commissioner's proposals envisage a thoroughly-trained reserve, with carefully selected powers and duties, working under the supervision of members of the Garda Síochána. I am engaged in a process of comprehensive consultation on these proposals, including consultation with a joint committee of these Houses.

We recognise that we were out-voted on that.At this stage, I want to minimise the damage the Minister intends to do. With that in mind, I recognise that the Minister is engaged, in his view, with the stakeholders in consultation. The problem is that the Garda representative associations are not the only stakeholders in this. One of the main stakeholders is obviously the community. Would the Minister agree that the community is the ultimate stakeholder in all of this? Why has the Minister not engaged in formal and meaningful consultation with NGOs and community sector representatives such as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the likes of Fr. McVerry and people who have raised concerns about the reserve force, the police force and its class basis in general? If he intends to do so, will he immediately initiate consultation with those bodies and not proceed any further until the outcome of those consultations?

As far as I am concerned, I suppose the Government parties are GOs — governmental organisations — for the time being but the Opposition parties are NGOs. The Opposition parties are non-governmental organisations which have a mandate from the people to speak on these matters. They have spoken with considerable clarity on the issue, and I have consulted and will consult with them.I will talk to anybody who wants to make a submission to me on the issue or who wants to make an input, and I am sure the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights of these Houses will take into account all of those points of view.On the other question of finding out what the people think, it is noteworthy that the Deputies opposite were selective in quoting for their purposes questions about attitudes to crime in a Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform sponsored opinion survey, which was published in March last. I remind Deputy Ó Snodaigh, in particular, that the overwhelming majority of people who were questioned in that survey, on which reliance was placed for every other purpose in the House, backed the concept of a reserve, while the overwhelming majority of public representatives back it as well. It is not a question of principle on which the public is badly divided. The question now is implementation and consultation. I will consult the Opposition and the Garda representative associations and I will encourage the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to take the opportunity to seek external views, as it so wishes. However, I do not accept the proposition that the community is represented in these matters by the views of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties or the esteemed Fr. McVerry. The public is clear and I must rely on my judgment as well in regard to people approaching me on the street to outline their views on the issue. It runs eight or nine to one in favour of establishing a reserve.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Since the formation of the State, Governments of every stripe have been slow, if not dilatory, in civilianising non-core policing functions. We have come late to the process compared with other European police jurisdictions. As the Hayes report into the Garda Síochána Act 2005 implementation review group stated:We are concerned that the rate of civilianisation in the Garda Síochána is low by international standards and much lower than in many immediately comparable services. Trained and experienced Garda officers, whose expertise is badly needed in other activities, are being used on desk and other work which would be much more appropriately, and probably more efficiently done by civilian staff who do the same sort of jobs elsewhere in the public service. However, civilianisation now goes further. In modern policing the skills of analysts and statisticians are increasingly being used, and many of the new breed of scene of crime officers are civilian and are recruited at graduate level as specialists in these fields. In particular, criminal intelligence analysis is now at the core of modern policing. Traditional approaches to making sense of data in relation to crime and individual criminal investigations are no longer adequate.In 2001, following negotiations with the Garda representative bodies, the Government approved the civilianisation of 496 posts in the Garda to be filled on a phased basis as gardaí occupying civilian posts in stations retired over a 20-year period. The programme drawn up provided for the civilianisation of these posts in the short, medium and long term, the transfer of the finance function from Garda district officers to civilian staff, and the transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda.Of the 496 posts identified in 2001 for civilianisation, 296 were administrative. The balance of the posts were specialist posts concerned with telecommunications, mapping, photography, etc. Furthermore, while 161 posts were identified for civilianisation in the short term, only 27 posts were to be civilianised in the period 2004 to 2006, with the remainder to be civilianised over the period up to 2021. Recently, the Garda representatives stated they want that process expedited. I welcome their change of heart and I look forward to discussing with the associations how the process of civilianisation can be expedited.Additional Information not given on the floor of the House.In this regard, it is worth noting that the direct replacement of individual gardaí doing clerical-administrative work in Garda stations has also been affected by the taking of equal pay cases by the Civil, Public and Services Union, CPSU. I am appealing those cases that were successful at the Equality Tribunal and expect that the appeal will be heard by the Labour Court before the summer.In the meantime, I am pleased to report significant progress in the implementation of the civilianisation programme. I can also confirm in this context that there is no embargo on the recruitment of civilians to fill clerical roles carried out by members of the Garda. While there is a cap on overall Civil Service numbers, this has not been allowed to impact on the filling of administrative vacancies in the Garda.The Government has at my request approved the transfer of 300 surplus posts from the Department of Agriculture and Food to my Department to assist with the Garda civilianisation programme. The first phase of this transfer has taken place in recent months with the establishment of the Garda information service centre, GISC, in Castlebar. When fully operational, this centre will employ more than 160 civilian staff. The GISC is yielding enormous benefits to the Garda. It frees up officers from having to return to the station following a crime event to enter data on PULSE. This means they can continue to carry out frontline policing duties while their reports are being typed up by their civilian colleagues. This scheme is in place in the southern division and will go nationwide later this year.The GISC, an innovation which I instigated, is just one part of the civilianisation programme being implemented. Some 113 civilian finance officers have been appointed and are carrying out the district finance officer duties in every Garda division that were hitherto performed by gardaí. A number of other posts that were previously held by members of the force have been, or are in the process of being, civilianised. Discussions are under way with staff interests on the implementation of a key recommendation in the civilianisation report — the transfer of civilian staff to the direct control of the Garda Commissioner — a reform that was legislated for in the Garda Síochána Act 2005. This transfer is due to take place on 1 October.However, it should be borne in mind that the 2001 civilianisation report was agreed at a point in time. It represented the conclusions of the group established to consider this issue several years ago in light of the prevailing circumstances and the consensus view of the staff and management interests at that time. It cannot be the final word on the matter. Since the report was written, a significant number of civilians have been recruited to work in the Garda doing tasks that were not even envisaged in 2001. Given that this has happened in the space of less than five years, it is inevitable that further significant changes in the operational environment of the Garda will occur over the next 15 years. The force is, by virtue of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, undergoing a programme of reform that is unprecedented in its 84-year history. It is clear that significantly increased civilianisation of the force, which would optimise its capacity to provide the frontline policing for which it has been trained, is a public policy imperative and one to which I am committed to advancing significantly on my watch.The civilianisation report provides an important point of departure in progressing civilianisation, but for the reasons outlined, it cannot be the final word on the issue. For this reason, a joint implementation group, drawn from management in the Garda and my Department, has been established to review the report in the light of developments in the intervening years and to plan and develop a comprehensive timetable for the ongoing implementation of civilianisation, both in the context of the report and otherwise. I expect this group will give the civilianisation programme a new impetus and I look forward to the outcome of its deliberations.As regards the Garda Síochána reserve, section 15 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the appointment of civilian reserve members of the Garda. I am very impressed with the comprehensive nature of the proposals for the Garda reserve made by the Garda Commissioner. The proposals envisage a thoroughly trained reserve with carefully selected powers and duties, working under the supervision of members of the Garda. I have met each of the Garda representative associations to discuss the Commissioner's proposals before I proceed to draw up the necessary regulations for Government approval. Further discussions will be held with the associations under the Garda conciliation scheme. I also intend to present the regulations in draft form to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for the consideration of the committee. The additional resource of a well trained civilian reserve with carefully selected powers and duties will significantly increase the capacity of the Garda to combat crime and disorder, and provide the public with the security and safety they rightly demand.In the Revised Estimates for 2006, €1.28 million has been provided in subhead A10 of the Garda Síochána Vote for costs associated with the establishment of the reserve. The full extent of resource requirements relating to the Garda reserve will be established in due course during the implementation process and adequate provision will be made in the Estimates process. I will deal with the establishment of the reserve in more detail in my reply to Priority QuestionNo. 5.

Is it not the case that there is a shortage of gardaí and the commitments to provide additional gardaí have not been kept? However, fully trained members are filling the position to which I referred. Why have they not been released from such activities?I spoke to representatives of the GRA and the AGSI and they have no difficulty with civilianisation. Why has it not been undertaken? Estates in every village, town and city are crying out for more gardaí, yet some members are tied to desks doing work that could be done equally as well and, in some instances, better by people trained separately to do so. Has the Minister a reasonable explanation for his failure to complete the process of civilianisation which was touted five years ago as part of the solution to the lack of Garda numbers?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The agreement arrived at in 2001 prior to my appointment provided for civilianisation of 496 posts over 20 years, with only 27 to be civilianised between then and now. At my request, 300 surplus posts in the Department of Agriculture and Food are to be transferred to my Department to assist with the civilianisation programme. The first phase took place in recent months with the establishment of the Garda information service centre, GISC, in Castlebar. When fully operational, this centre will employ more than 160 civilian staff. It will be a call centre for PULSE and it will mean gardaí will no longer have to return to their stations to input reports.The Deputy referred to the numbers of gardaí engaged in IT, human resources and the press office and I share his view that these are not core policing functions. It is my intention to engage with the representative associations on rapidly accelerating the civilianisation process above and beyond the snail's pace agreed with them in 2001. The Deputy stated they have no problem with this. We will see when we sit down with them whether they are agreeable to the acceleration of the programme agreed in 2001, but I agree with the Deputy that this should be done.With regard to human resources, it is significant that, for the first time, a civilian manager has been recruited in this area by the Garda. Such functions should not be carried out by gardaí. Recruits do not pass through Templemore to become human resources managers or press officers. I look forward to the time most of those positions will be in the hands of civilians and members who currently undertake those functions will be engaged in frontline policing duties. The public wants to see them on the streets.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	235	In July 2005, as part of a submission on the future resourcing requirements of the Garda, the Garda Commissioner proposed the recruitment of up to 4,000 reserve members, as provided for in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, and an increase in the force's strength from 14,000 to 15,000. In response, and in the context of identifying policing priorities for inclusion in the Garda policing plan for 2006, I set the objective of the recruitment of 900 reserve members by September 2006. Subsequently, the Commissioner submitted detailed proposals to me on the recruitment, training, powers, duties and deployment of reserve members. The proposals envisage a thoroughly trained reserve with carefully selected powers and duties, working under the supervision of members of the Garda.I must make regulations under the 2005 Act, with Government approval, to give effect to these proposals. I have made it clear that, before I do so, I would like to have detailed consultations with the Garda representative associations and I intend also to refer the regulations in draft form to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for its consideration. I should have them in the next few days. The recruitment campaign for reserve members will commence as soon as the regulations are made.I have met representatives of all four Garda associations on this issue and have invited them to further and more detailed discussions. The Garda reserve will reinforce the links between the Garda and local communities and it will enhance the capacity of the force to respond to emerging policing challenges. I have seen how well special constabularies, which are broadly equivalent to the reserve, work in Britain and how good and effective are the relations between them and the regular police forces. This is a great opportunity to enhance the policing service and I urge the two main Garda associations to take the opportunity to make their contribution to it. My door is open for consultation.

I dealt with this issue the last time I was in the House for question time. At the time the draft heads of the Bill were being published, there was a Government freeze on any further recruitment to the Garda Síochána above 12,200. I told the AGSI that I would never use a reserve as a substitute to arrive at the 14,000 member mark, which was promised in the programme for Government. As things stood at that time, it was unlikely that any recruiting of the reserve would be done in the life of this Government. Things changed——

At the beginning, there were delay mechanisms to the introduction of the reserve force. The overwhelming consensus of this House — the only exception to which was the view of the Sinn Féin Deputies — was that I should go ahead and recruit the reserve now. The joint committee sent a delegation to view how reservists work in the UK and it was so impressed that it was in favour of the proposition. I am only doing what the Oireachtas wants me to do.

In my first meeting with the AGSI spokesmen, they said the Minister gave such a commitment. Did the Minister contact them subsequently to resile from that when circumstances altered and the embargo was changed? It would have been good practice to do so.I share the view of the previous Labour Party spokesman on justice, Deputy Costello, that there is a role for a reserve force. Will the September 2006 target to deploy 900 recruits be met? Does he accept the Garda Commissioner's recommended number of 4,000 recruits in total? What is the training regime for the reserve? Is it set in stone or is it subject to negotiation? Is the Minister now sure of the specific powers to be devolved to the new reserve force?

That sets out in extenso his view of the powers that the reserve force should have. It is not his function to determine these matters, but rather a question for the Government to make an order. I intend to consult with the joint committee on these issues before we arrive at a final position.I originally spoke of a ratio of 1:10, which means there would be about 1,400 members of the reserve force. The Garda organisation development unit was working on that basis in early 2005. Different views have been expressed since then. Deputy O'Keeffe suggested 5,000.

The work involved has resulted in a situation where processing has continued to move strongly in both agencies. By 31 March 2006, there were 2,609 cases on hands in both agencies compared to around 7,000 cases on hands at the end of January 2004. The number of applications over six months in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal by 31 March 2006 stood at 484 compared to 6,500 at the end of September 2001. The backlog of applications has been eliminated in ORAC with only 63 cases on hand over six months at the end of March 2006 and 421 in the appeal tribunal, a significant number of which are at an advanced stage of processing. There is continued momentum in processing timescales for asylum applications, with new arrangements for speedier processing of prioritised asylum applications from nationals of Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa, introduced from January 2005 with a 17 working-day processing time at first instance in ORAC and a 15 working-day processing time at appeals stage in the RAT. Currently, almost 40% of total applications fall into the prioritised category.With effect from 1 November 2005, all applicants for asylum are notified of their interview date by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner at the time they make their applications. The interview appointment is normally within 20 working days of application. However, for those applicants within the prioritised category, interviews in ORAC are held within nine to 12 days. The typical processing time in the ORAC for non-prioritised cases is in the region of eight to nine weeks. The average length of time taken to process and complete substantive appeals in the RAT is approximately 14 weeks. Substantial progress also continues to be made in effecting deportation orders as well as transfer orders to other EU member states under the EU Dublin II regulation.In 2002, we received 11,600 applications, of which 894 were granted status at first instance. Of the 4,323 applications we received last year, 455 or 10% were granted status at first instance. Some 1,099 were granted status upon appeal, 832 in 2003, 708 in 2004, 511 in 2005 and, thus far this year, with a reduced number of appeals, 47 have been granted. In 2002, 2,430 deportation orders were signed by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and by me.

Has the Minister entered discussions with the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on these matters? What specific measures have been taken to ensure that unaccompanied children who arrive here seeking asylum are protected in all instances and are only reunited with families when relationships are confirmed?Has the Minister explored alternative repatriation methods to chartering expensive aircraft and sending gardaí to the four corners of the globe? Does he agree that is an extraordinarily expensive way of conducting the matter? What voluntary repatriation mechanisms has he explored and to what end?With regard to aged out minors, it is a cause of great concern that youngsters who have established educational and other affiliations to Irish society are summarily deported upon turning 18.

In general terms, they are of reasonably robust disposition, have travelled long distances to come to Ireland alone and secured passage here by paying substantial sums of money to traffickers. I would not be overly romantic about the fact that 16 and 17 year olds claim asylum here. In my mind, there is no great difference between a 17 year old and an 18 year old travelling from Nigeria to Paris to Dublin.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	267	What about a 12 year old?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	268	In many cases they are roughly comparable. However, because they are deemed in Ireland to be minors, they are dealt with differently in that they are taken under the aegis of the HSE. They are clothed and given a different level of accommodation to legally adult asylum seekers, who are accommodated in hostels operated by the RIA. Under 18s are educated and well provided for in general terms. Concerns have been expressed with regard to reuniting them with families and suggestions were made that some 16 and 17 year old non-national girls have been coerced into lives of crime and put at risk. However, these represent a tiny minority in a flow of people.As regards Deputy Howlin's question about chartering aircraft, the great majority of deportees do not travel on chartered flights. Their fares are paid and the International Organisation for Migration frequently makes arrangements for them. In any case, they are encouraged to leave voluntarily by making their own arrangements. Frequently, people who have been convicted of criminal offences are deported and, in most cases, we do not await a flight before deporting them.I would prefer to persuade most of the people due for deportation to voluntarily board a flight home but every European country has learned the lesson that it is necessary to uphold the law and put it into effect by compulsory means. Otherwise, people will simply prevaricate and disobey the law.With regard to aged out minors, we treat the people who come here at the ages of 16 and 17 very generously. They attend secondary education, have different standards of accommodation, receive pocket money and are treated well by the State. The outgoing UN High Commissioner for Refugees praised the Irish system, describing it as one of the best in the EU.When these people come to full age, there is no presumption that they should stay here if they were not originally entitled to refugee status. I will not go down the road of allowing someone who came here at the age of 16 and who spent two years in secondary education to be treated radically differently from an 18 year old who is sent back in a matter of weeks through an accelerated process. I will not be pushed into making such arbitrary and indefensible discrimination between two categories of asylum seekers.

Does he accept that huge problems arise with the operation of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, that many of the appointments he made reek of pure cronyism and that there are significant inconsistencies in the decisions reached by the tribunal's 35 members? Does he agree there has been a major increase in judicial review and that these cases are now clogging up the High Court? I gather approximately 700 such applications are before the High Court. Does the Minister agree——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I do not accept that there have been massive problems or any cronyism. The RAT is a fine group of men and women who have done the State some considerable service. There have been newspaper reports about their earnings, which are on a per-case basis. They have undertaken a massive backlog of appeals, which I mentioned earlier, and have virtually eliminated it. We are dealing with people on a real-time basis and processing their applications in a matter of weeks. Great tribute is owed to members of the RAT and ORAC for the way they have turned around the system. It has been suggested that there has been inconsistency and different approaches between members and that only those who are tough have received significant amounts of case work in the tribunal. I have investigated that point and one of the top earners is a person whose record was probably one of the most liberal, so I do not accept that view.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asks if we can have a different approach in light of declining numbers. Let us remember that this tribunal was established when there was a flood of asylum seekers and a large backlog of work. The time has come to review the tribunal.

I reiterate that the UN High Commissioner, who has had constant access to both levels of the tribunal, said that Ireland's system was one of the best in Europe. No complaint has been made.

If it were possible I would welcome the Irish public's seeing the stories that are put forward and rejected at both levels, unbelievable stories of human sacrifice and selection for cults.

How many asylum seekers who have been here for longer than five years are awaiting final decision? I know one or two, and if there are any it is a disgrace. How many asylum seekers have been refused permission to land, who decides this and what reasons are given? I thought such refusal was contrary to international law. Once a person reaches our shores they should have the right to seek asylum.

Ireland has one of the most liberal and generous asylum regimes in the EU. A group of people in Irish politics believes we run a draconian regime because we do not allow ourselves to be trampled over. The flow of asylum seekers to Ireland has diminished because I strengthened the law.

Measures such as the Eurodac system and the Dublin 2 regulations are creating a climate that is less open to abuse by asylum seekers. Ireland still has a system that is generous to genuine asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution.

Does the Minister examine the relative safety of each child's destination country, the economic and political conditions and whether it is affected by armed conflict? Does he support the values of the Irish Constitution, particularly Article 41, the family article? Both the Irish Constitution and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child highlight the preservation of family life and the right of Irish children to enjoy the company of their parents or other family members. The figure of 396 deportations does not suggest a liberal regime.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I uphold constitutional values to the letter and in the spirit of the Constitution. Where parents come to Ireland with an infant child or have a child in Ireland, under our Constitution it is not only the right but the duty of the parents to look after their child. If the parents are not allowed to reside legally in Ireland it is their duty to take their child with them whence they came. I reject the notion canvassed recently in the newspapers that the Irish State has an obligation to every Irish-born child to have that child remain in Ireland. The Supreme Court did not uphold that proposition when it was argued before it and would make nonsense of our law. As the Deputy knows, I promoted a referendum on Irish born children who are Irish citizens, which was supported by 80% of the people. During that referendum I promised I would deal in a decent and commonsense way with those who have children in Ireland who are Irish born citizens. I established a scheme last year and 17,900 people, not the handful that opponents of the referendum said were an issue, asked to remain in Ireland on foot of the scheme. Including siblings and the like that will mean approximately 25,000 people will remain in Ireland on foot of that scheme. I have not been behind the door. I have shown common sense and have been fair and generous in the way I have dealt with this issue.

The Minister used the term "flood". I ask that he withdraw that as it is an injudicious term to use with regard to migrants to this country. Will he consider carefully the case of aged out minors who have lived in Ireland for three years or longer? It is a small group and one quite different from many other categories of those who have come to this country. Will he look favourably on allowing them to remain?

Is there such a remarkable difference between a 17 and a half year old and an 18 and a half year old who come to Ireland when they come to be considered at the age of 19 as to whether one should go home or one should remain? I do not think there is a difference. I do not see a logical reason for drawing a major distinction between the two categories. Every case where humanitarian leave to remain is sought is examined by reference to a number of criteria which are set out in statute. However, the impression is created that the process does not examine these cases.With regard to my use of the term "flood", at the beginning of the asylum seeking process Ireland was overwhelmed by a movement of people into Ireland.

Is he further aware of replies from his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in regard to the stability of the jurisdictions to which some of these people are being returned, wherein that Minister indicates instability and serious threat to life?Is it true, as has been suggested, that some of the adjudicators on decisions on asylum or refugee status have never or hardly ever given a positive decision?

The duties of the commissioners are mainly operational and they are responsible for ensuring the operational efficiency of their respective region and, in particular, the quality of operational management exercised by their divisional and district officers. Each region is divided into divisions commanded by a chief superintendent, and each division is then divided into districts commanded by a superintendent, assisted by a number of inspectors. Garda divisions do not necessarily correspond to county boundaries.The Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, is made up of the six Garda divisions of DMR south central, DMR north central, DMR south, DMR north, DMR west and DMR east. The Dublin metropolitan region extends into parts of counties Wicklow and Kildare. In this regard, the Garda stations in Bray, Greystones and Enniskerry, while within the County of Wicklow, form part of the DMR east region. Leixlip Garda station, which lies within the Kildare county boundary, forms part of the DMR west region.Any proposal to alter the boundaries of any Garda region is in the first instance a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Under section 22 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, any such proposal must be contained in a draft policing plan for the following year which must be submitted to the Minister for approval. I will carefully consider any such proposal that the Commissioner may submit to me, although I understand that the Commissioner currently has no plans to alter the divisional boundaries within the DMR.

This makes it difficult to put a meaningful interpretation on statistics from the Garda Síochána. If the statistics are difficult to interpret, it will make for poor policing and poor analysis of data. Will the Minister bring his influence to bear to introduce co-ordination between the various offices of State that produce statistics in this regard? It is difficult enough to find one's way through the various definitions of crime, which seem not to have been updated for the past 100 years or so, but to use districts that bear no relation to the kinds of areas that the Central Statistics Office, the Health Service Executive, local authorities or other agencies use renders it a complete mess when one tries to put a meaningful construct on such data. Can the Minister use his influence to bring some meaningful co-ordination of the kinds of areas used by him and his colleagues at the Cabinet table?

If they are to function reasonably, they should correspond with understandable local authority boundaries, and that issue will be examined. Regarding the Dublin area, the facts say that Enniskerry is regarded as an adjunct of Dublin, although it is in the same Garda district as Shillelagh in lower County Wicklow, but that is not a significant issue for policing. As PULSE develops, it is becoming easier to produce very specific figures.I also stress that, even if one operates by counties for statistics on offences, one finds that offenders do not look to see whether they are operating in South Dublin, Dún Laoghaire, Fingal or wherever. They carry out their functions as it suits them. Therefore, the concept of a greater Dublin policing area such as the Dublin metropolitan region is not suspect.

I have heard anecdotes about bodies being pushed from one side of a river or canal to another to try to get a Garda division off the hook. When insurance companies charge different premia depending on one's postal district, that suggests a need for meaningful districts and areas allowing us to consider health and policing records and other data.I am glad the Minister stated in his reply that there may well be a review of such areas, and I ask that he and his colleagues in Cabinet put their heads together to co-ordinate the various areas that they use. The confusion, overlap and disparity between them make it very difficult to formulate meaningful policies based on data produced by the Central Statistics Office or used by individual Departments. It illustrates the wider difficulty and danger in Departments' co-ordination. If the Minister could address the Garda policing districts, that would be a step in the right direction.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	356	In recent years, Fenit Harbour has been largely neglected, especially in comparison with the other west coast ports of Killybegs or Castletownberehaven. A grant received in 2004 was welcome but totally inadequate relative to the vast level of safety and structural repairs needed to bring Fenit up to an acceptable standard and make it competitive. Costings of more than €6 million for work to bring the port up to a competitive level and modernise it have been forwarded to the commercial harbours division. That work is urgent, as the port's continued operation is at stake and thus the continued existence of 420 jobs at Liebherr in Killarney, for example, as well as those at the port itself.The harbour board has once again outlined the type of work to be completed, including repairs to the viaduct, dredging, rotary fendering on the main pier, remedial work to the west wall and the cross quay, refurbishment of the main pier and replacement of the crane. Of the €750,000 national development plan funding promised by the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, some years ago, only €93,000 was received and invested in a second-hand crane that must now be replaced.The strategic importance of Fenit Harbour is often overlooked in a national context. Without it, Liebherr could not operate. It also has major national and regional importance. For example, during the year, 45 m blades for wind turbines were landed there. They could not be shipped through any other port owing to the road network. Fenit is also a sheltered harbour that allows large trawlers and small ships to dock regardless of tidal conditions. There are no lock gates such as in ports including Kilrush and Galway, and trawlers can enter at any time while for the most part they can enter Dingle only at high tide.Another important consideration is Fenit's proximity to the South Porcupine Bank. It is expected that major exploration for offshore oil will be encouraged soon owing to its high price, and Fenit could provide an ideal base for the oil industry if the Porcupine Bank took off. Recently a major gas find was announced approximately 120 miles off the west Kerry coast. There may be some activity there in the near future, and Fenit would be an ideal base for contract crews and so on. It is also very close to Tralee station and Kerry Airport, meaning that it is ideally located. I do not know whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has any responsibility in the area. I cannot impress enough on the Minister the importance of making significant investment in the harbour. I appeal to him to urge his Cabinet colleague to consider carefully and positively the recommendation made by the harbour commissioners for this funding.

Responsibility for Tralee and Fenit harbour and for 12 other regional harbours operating under the Harbours Act 1946 transferred from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the Department of Transport with effect from 1 January 2006. The Tralee and Fenit Harbour Commissioners are responsible for the control, operation and management of the harbour.The Government's ports policy statement, which was launched in January 2005, states that the continued operation of the regional harbours, operating under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946, is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance. The policy statement reiterated the view that most of these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership or where this is not possible, through sale to the private sector. In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists, such as in Tralee and Fenit harbour, consideration will be given to bringing such harbours under the control of a port company.My colleague's Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advance the implementation of the ports policy statement with regard to the transfer of the designated regional harbours to their respective local authorities, where appropriate, and to proceed individually in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and harbour authorities, having regard to local requirements in each case.Funding of €600,000 was provided in 2004 to Tralee and Fenit harbour for repairs to the viaduct and the widening of the pier. The harbour commissioners were made aware in correspondence at that time that there was no commitment to provide further Exchequer funding for additional works and that they would have to make arrangements to provide funding for additional works from their own resources.The limited resources available in the Department of Transport for expenditure on regional harbours are being concentrated on essential safety and remedial works, pending the transfer of the harbours to local authority or port company control.The commissioners have recently sought additional funding for remedial works at their harbour, which Deputy Deenihan mentioned. Their funding proposals and those from the other regional harbours will be considered over the coming months in the context of the necessity to prioritise the limited available budget towards essential safety and remedial works.

I do not believe the Minister for Education and Science is fully aware of the consequences of such a closure.The school is located in one of the most disadvantaged estates in Dublin. Most of the estate has been demolished pending regeneration and that is a recognition of the need to address a problem which existed. The school is contained within historic buildings and is part of the Richmond Barracks complex. Ninety years ago tomorrow, the leaders and volunteers of the army of the Irish Republic, including, I presume, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's grand-uncle, were held and court-martialled there in one of the buildings which still exists, the gymnasium.The school has been and is intended to be part and at the heart of the regeneration of this community. It is a small school with 67 or 69 pupils and given that small number, it is a model of good practice. It has small classes and individual attention is provided when and if required by some of the pupils who are better because of it. The new principal was hoping to add the school, the programme of work and the teaching environment in the school.For the teachers, parents and young children at the school, last Tuesday's announcement was a bolt out of the blue. The teachers will have no jobs at the end of June and the parents will have no school to which to sent their children in September. What is required is for the Department and the Minister to step in to ensure the school is kept open, whether under the Department's control or that of another sponsor group. The Department should make itself aware of the regeneration plans which include building 137 family homes next to the school within the next year followed by 583 other homes. Obviously, within a year or two those families will be looking for schools in the locality in which to place their children. None of the other local schools has capacity to take the new people who will be coming into the area or even the existing pupils. There are no sites left in Inchicore on which to build a new school or even the secondary school required in Inchicore.The Minister has responsibility in this regard because what is the point regenerating an area if one of the central planks of it, namely, educational opportunities for disadvantaged children, is removed? The Minister should invite the parents and board of management to a meeting immediately to ensure the school continues and is viable into the future.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue which in the past couple of days became quite a critical matter for the parents, teachers and pupils in St. Michael's CBS in Inchicore. It is a school which has been part of that community for 70 years. As has been mentioned, it has great historical association apart from the educational aspects. The proposal to close the school at the end of this school year came as a major shock to the parents whose children attend the school and to the teachers who deliver a quality programme of learning on a daily basis.The school has a high reputation of delivering a caring learning programme for the pupils and, given the small number of pupils, the student-teacher ratio has been very favourable. It is true the ratio is significantly better than in most other primary schools but this is the system to which children who attend the school have become used and they would, therefore, find it difficult to adapt to larger classroom experiences at this stage. The proposal to reduce the number of teachers and special needs assistants and the absence of a caretaker, for example, would make it extremely difficult to provide the same level of care and attention for the pupils which they have experienced up to now.If the school is to close this June, parents must find places for their children in other schools immediately. I know of parents who booked their children into schools the day they were christened so that is a four year lead-in period. It is a bit too much to expect the parents to find a school with which they are entirely happy within the next eight weeks. That is a very practical issue for them. If they get places in alternative schools, for the most part it will mean they will have to travel by bus into perhaps the inner city. We are talking about children from the ages of eight to 12. Walking to school would not be an option for them because of the distance. Apart from the difficulty for children getting to school on buses, there would also be a significant cost factor for the parents involved. It is also possible that parents would have to send siblings — for example, two brothers currently going to school in Inchicore — to two different schools and that would probably add to the difficulties for them.Inchicore is an area where much good development is taking place, which is welcome. There will be an increasing and young population there in the next couple of years. These are the issues which face the school today and within the next five years. The parents are very proud of their school and their locality. I would have liked the Minister for Education and Science to be here. I do not know whether she has visited the school and seen the work going on there or knows of the impact a reduction in staff levels would have on the quality of teaching and the morale of the school if it was to be retained with an understaffed quota relative to what it currently has.The Christian Brothers have quite rightly stated that if the resources are not provided, the school will not be able to deliver the quality of teaching that has come to be expected and that they wish to deliver in one of its schools. It is also the case that parents passionately want their local school to be retained, not just for now but for the future.I ask the Minister to meet the Christian Brothers, together with the board of management, to resolve this dilemma. The primary interest must be the welfare of the children attending the school and their right to a quality education, not just for now but also for the next five years, during which time many young children will become eligible to attend the school. The news of the school's closure, which is due at the end of this academic year, certainly came as a body blow to the parents when it was announced earlier this week by the Christian Brothers. The timing is not very good or encouraging for the parents. Every effort should be made to assuage their fears and ensure teaching capacity in the area is retained.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter. I am very concerned at the proposed closure by the Christian Brothers of St. Michael's CBS, Inchicore. Many of us were educated by the Christian Brothers and I received my primary education from them. It was a very good education. The Christian Brothers provided, to millions of young boys in particular, an education that was second to none in spite of the difficulties and lack of resources experienced over the past 100 years. The challenges that now exist in St. Michael's CBS are small in comparison with those the Christian Brothers faced in the past and which they overcame through hard work and dignity, thereby resulting in success.St. Michael's CBS is a particularly important school, not only for the people of Inchicore or Dublin South-Central but also for the people of the whole country. The Inchicore area, especially around St. Michael's, is the most socially and economically disadvantaged and deprived area in the country. The school is providing education to a very small number of children who need individual attention because of the physical, social or familial problems they face and because of all the other factors that impinge upon the development of such young children. The teachers, Christian Brothers and board of management have worked very hard and successfully over recent years to provide the type of education and nurturing these children need and deserve.I understand the Taoiseach visited the school not too long ago and met all the pupils and teachers. Despite the fact that the school did not have the correct pupil-teacher ratio, the Taoiseach saw the need for an administrative principal in the school and enabled the creation of this position. I understand circumstances have changed and I therefore ask the Minister for Education and Science to do as Deputy Upton suggested, that is, meet the Christian Brothers, board of management and parents of the children and visit the school to see for herself the case that exists for having an administrative principal so the education the Christian Brothers want to give to the children can be continued in the school.I pay tribute to the parents of the children in the school. Many are lone parents and have difficulties parents in more affluent areas would not experience, yet they were able to come together, hold a meeting, take the initiative, protest and articulate their horror and disgust over the proposed closure. They have done this in a manner that has made all their public representatives proud. I would like support to be given to these parents and particularly to their children so that St. Michael's CBS can continue to operate.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	361	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, the position of her Department on the recently announced closure of St. Michael's national school in Inchicore. The Minister has asked me to apologise on her behalf for being unable to attend to deal with this matter. She is addressing the Secondary School Management Association conference in Killarney this afternoon.Reports in the media that the Christian Brothers intend to close St. Michael's primary school at the end of June came as a shock to the Minister. Closing the school at such short notice is a very unusual decision which is understandably very upsetting and distressing for the parents, teachers and pupils involved. The Minister has arranged an early meeting with the Christian Brothers for next week. It would have been expected that the Department of Education and Science would have been afforded the courtesy of being informed of the decision at the earliest opportunity so that it could commence procedures to ensure the pupils concerned would have the certainty of an alternative placement for next September.The Government has worked very hard to ensure that children from disadvantaged areas and those with special needs get all the extra support they need to reach their full potential at school. We have provided the extra staff needed to make this policy a reality. By next September, there will be 4,000 more primary teachers in our schools than there were in 2002. I acknowledge what has been said by all three Deputies on the particular deprivation many of the children involved will suffer in the course of their lives because of extraneous circumstances.Schools such as St. Michael's CBS, which serve children from disadvantaged areas and those with special needs, have enjoyed the benefit of the aforementioned policy to the extent that St. Michael's has a pupil-teacher ratio of fewer than ten children to each teacher. This means the school has a very generous staff allocation, which many of the parents have pointed out in media interviews. For the next school year, the school was to have a principal and five other teachers for an enrolment of slightly more than 60 pupils. This is twice the normal staff level that applies in the case of most national schools of similar size. Given this substantially reduced pupil-teacher ratio, it is difficult to accept that the decision to close the school has anything to do with staffing. Even if the school authority feels it has issues regarding staffing, the decision to close it in such an abrupt and unexpected fashion could only lead to the type of reaction seen in recent days. Processes should have been followed regarding the closure of the school and other processes could have been followed to appeal the staffing allocation.The Department of Education and Science will work closely with the school authorities to see if the closure can be avoided. If that is not possible, the Department will press for at least a phased and orderly closure. A phased and orderly closure and winding down of the school would ensure that there is sufficient time for any necessary and appropriate arrangements to be put in place for existing and potential pupils of the school. If it becomes necessary to seek alternative placements for some of the pupils the early indications are that places are available in some other schools in the area, including in a school in the Christian Brothers network as enrolments in the area have undergone a decline in recent years. The Department of Education and Science will take all necessary steps to ensure adequate provision in the area for the pupils concerned.As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, Richmond Barracks is a historic place. It was my grandfather and not my granduncle who went there in the context of the 1916 Rising and, for his trouble, was arrested, put on trial at that place, court-martialled and sentenced to life imprisonment.Westland Row in my constituency has a Christian Brothers secondary school, which is also under threat. That too is a disadvantaged community. Everybody must put the children from our disadvantaged communities first in our priorities.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	362	On 12 December 2005, I made an order under the provisions of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 establishing the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. On 13 December 2005 the Government decided to nominate the following persons for appointment by the President to be members of the Ombudsman Commission: Mr. Justice Kevin Haugh to be chairperson; Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Conor Brady. Subsequently, resolutions were passed by each House of the Oireachtas, as required by the Act, recommending their appointment, and they were appointed by the President on 10 February 2006.I am pleased to inform the House that I provided a provisional budget for 2006 of €10 million to the Ombudsman Commission. I draw the attention of Deputies to paragraph 23, page 12 of the Report of the Implementation Review Group on the Garda Síochána Act, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, which states that they are satisfied that this provisional budget is adequate.Under the Act, it is a matter for the Ombudsman Commission to recruit its staff, subject to my consent and the consent of my colleague, the Minister for Finance, as to numbers and grades. A key determining factor in the staff projections of the Ombudsman Commission will undoubtedly be the balance it will strike between directly investigating complaints and referring complaints to the Garda Commissioner for investigation, with or without supervision. The Ombudsman Commission is now in discussions with my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the filling of a number of senior posts in the organisation, and these discussions should be concluded shortly. The Ombudsman Commission will then have to recruit and train its staff. I expect that this will be a continuing process over the remainder of this year and that it may take up to early next year before the Ombudsman Commission is in a position to start receiving complaints. It will also have to secure permanent accommodation.I should say that, following its establishment, I arranged to provide the Ombudsman Commission with a small transitional team from the staff of my Department to act as a temporary resource until it secures its permanent staff. I have also provided it with temporary accommodation.I am satisfied that the members of the Ombudsman Commission are making good progress in preparing the organisation to be ready to start receiving complaints in early 2007 as planned.

The tribunal has been in operation since November 2000 and is comprised, at the present time, of a full-time chairperson and 33 part-time members.The tribunal has undertaken a significant job of work since its establishment, taking some 23,107 decisions up to the end of 2005. It has also been tackling on an ongoing basis the number of appeals on hands and moving from a situation, for example, where on 31 January 2004 it had some 2,596 appeals to clear — some 990 of which were more than six months old — to a situation at the end of December 2005 where it had 1,267 appeals on hands, only 258 of which were more than six months old and a significant number of which are at an advanced stage of processing.I would like to record my appreciation to the chairperson of the tribunal, its members and staff for their efforts to date in carrying out the important work of the tribunal in meeting the State's obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees.As was pointed out in the public consultation document setting out outline policy proposals for an Immigration and Residence Bill issued by me in April 2005, the State is required to introduce a subsidiary protection regime under EU law later this year. Transposition of the relevant EU directive on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection will be catered for in the Bill, the scheme of which is at an advanced stage of preparation.This provides an opportunity, of which I intend to avail, to re-examine, in the light of the experience of the last decade, how protection claims are dealt with under present law including at appeals stage. Any proposals which I have for change will be announced in the usual manner in due course.

The Children Act 2001 proposed to raise the age of criminal responsibility from seven years to 12 years but, as the relevant section was never commenced, the age at present is still seven years. Two problems were encountered in raising the age as envisaged in the 2001 Act. First, because the common law meaning of the age of criminal responsibility is the age of capacity to commit an offence, the offence per se is not available as a ground for intervention in relation to the child. In practical terms this means that there could be no meaningful Garda intervention with children below the age of criminal responsibility, even where such children did not require the services of the Health Service Executive. Second, the original proposal in the 2001 Act would have given ten and 11 year old children total immunity to being dealt with for the most serious offences on the Statute Book.The amendments to the 2001 Act proposed for inclusion in the Criminal Justice Bill satisfactorily overcome both the problems I have outlined in a fair and balanced way, which mean that for all practical purposes the age of criminal responsibility is being raised to 12 years. By making these changes to the 2001 Act, it has been possible to provide a commencement provision automatically bringing the relevant amendments to that Act into operation three months after the enactment of the Criminal Justice Bill.

This Bill will repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004, as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2004, and replace them with provisions more suited to modern conditions.While I have no current proposals to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor in glass containers while a special exemption order is in operation, this is a matter that could be debated further in the context of the future legislation. I should add that section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 already provides that a special exemption order may contain such conditions as the District Court thinks proper. Such conditions could include a restriction on the supply of intoxicating liquor in glass containers.

One of its principal functions under the Act is to licence companies and persons providing a whole range of security services. The authority has already commenced licensing contractors providing private security services in the door supervisor and security guarding areas as well as licensing for suppliers and installers of intruder alarms.I understand that the authority proposes to licence all other sectors of the industry on a phased basis including the cash-in-transit sector. It is my understanding that the cash-in-transit licensing will commence later this year.Last year, I called on the main players in the cash-in-transit sector of the industry, which included the financial institutions, security companies, the Garda Síochána and the Central Bank, to draw up an agreement, on a voluntary basis that would see the industry operating to the highest international standards. The agreement was signed last June and progress towards implementation was made in the course of the last year.It was intended to introduce licensing of the cash movement sector at the end of a voluntary compliance period where the industry would be given time within which to bring its standards up to the requisite approved standards, which would form the basis for licensing.Following the recent incidents involving cash-in-transit vehicles I have had discussions with the Garda Commissioner, the chief executive of the Private Security Authority, representatives of the financial institutions, representatives of the cash-in-transit companies and SIPTU, representing workers in the industry. It is quite clear to me, that while some progress has been made, and while considerable moneys are being invested in improving the security of cash movements, a radical lapse in standards had occurred during these incidents. As a result, the chief executive of the Private Security Authority has advised me that she will bring forward proposals for the introduction of mandatory licensing as soon as possible.I should say to the Deputy that it is not simply a case of replacing the agreed voluntary code of practice with a new one. The objectives of the agreed voluntary code of practice are to ensure the highest standards of operation in the industry and the implementation of integrated end-to-end solutions to create safe secure and efficient cash handling. I understand that adherence to the code of practice will be an integral part of the licensing regime and that companies which do not comply with the code of practice will not be licensed to operate in the cash movement sector.

The group was established to consider and prepare for the Government an appropriate legislative basis for the protection of privacy which would be consistent with freedom of expression. It was asked to take into account the work of the Law Reform Commission in its final report on privacy, which followed on from an earlier consultation paper prepared by the commission.As the Deputy will appreciate, consultations and representations will continue as a feature in relation to a Bill following its publication.

It operates on a nationwide basis under the supervision and direction of the Garda National Juvenile Office, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2. The programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age, who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident, may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution.The Children Act 2001, which came into law in May 2002, gave a statutory basis to the juvenile diversion programme which includes a restorative justice aspect. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are responsible for administering the programme at the local level.Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. All Garda juvenile liaison officers have received training in restorative justice and over half have received training in mediation skills. The ongoing development of restorative justice within the juvenile diversion programme has the objective of a significant reduction in the incidence of recidivism.Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, including JLO assignments, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.In addition to the juvenile diversion programme, there are also 64 Garda youth diversion projects nationwide, with plans to increase this to 100 by the end of 2007. Garda youth diversion projects are a crime prevention initiative, which adopt a multi-agency partnership approach to tackling crime and anti-social behaviour at community level.The projects aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project. The projects are particularly targeted at ten to 18 year old "at risk" youths in communities where a specific need has been identified.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	371	In my response to the Deputy in Question No. 412 on 4 April 2006, I set out a synopsis of the process involved in considering applications for naturalisation. In this regard, it is important to note that naturalisation is not an entitlement so there is no question of rubber stamping the approval of applications. Naturalisation is a privilege granted at my absolute discretion and I must, therefore, be fully satisfied that all applicants meet the statutory requirements set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act.I also provided the Deputy with statistics in my reply to his earlier parliamentary question of the number of applications for naturalisation received in the years 2000 to 2005. These figures illustrate a significant upward trend in the number of applications received during that six year period. With 1,936 applications received to date in 2006, the upward trend looks set to continue and it appears likely that close to 6,000 applications will be received this year.At the start of 2001, the average processing time for an application for naturalisation was two and a half years. Additional staff were assigned to the citizenship section of the Department and by the beginning of 2002, the average processing time had been reduced to 15 months. However, the processing time started to rise again as my officials began to process the 3,574 applications received in 2002. During 2004 and into early 2005, I doubled the number of staff dealing exclusively with citizenship matters to the current level of 41. This resulted in a stabilising of the processing time at 24 months, notwithstanding the continuing increase in the volume of applications being received. My officials continue to examine ways to reduce processing times but in view of the significant increase in the volume of applications being received it is unlikely that an early reduction can be achieved in the current processing time of 24 months.

The response of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to Question No. 3 of 2 February 2006 concerning the report was also brought to the attention of the authority.The position remains as indicated in the response to that question of 2 February 2006 that I do not accept that there are any significant shortfalls in our equality legislation compared to that in Northern Ireland. In terms of legislative coherence, access to tribunals and protection on the ground of sexual orientation, the equality provisions here are in advance of those in Northern Ireland. I do not accept that under the Good Friday Agreement, to ensure equivalence, the Oireachtas is obliged to copy every legislative innovation with a human rights dimension that has been or could conceivably be introduced at some stage in Northern Ireland.

My priority is to enhance the level of front-line policing services to the public, and overtime plays a key role in this.The nature of Garda work, and the requirement that the Garda authorities respond at short notice to immediate policing demands, mean that overtime expenditure is essential for the purposes of effective policing. That is so even taking into account the major increase in Garda strength currently under way, as the objective of Garda overtime is to allow the Garda Síochána flexibility in responding to circumstances which require personnel resources over and above those available from gardaí on rostered duty.The Estimate provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is €83.5 million, which represents an increase of €23 million on last year's original allocation. This will greatly aid the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted way. The sum of €83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra man hours of policing by uniformed gardaí and by special units throughout the State. The Garda Commissioner has assured me that this level of resources will enable the force to implement significant targeted intelligence-driven and high-intensity operations against organised crime, especially drug crime. Furthermore, I have made available a further €10 million to the Garda Commissioner for special Garda operations tackling specific forms of crime including burglaries and other offences.I should also say that the Commissioner has put in place financial controls at all levels within the Garda Síochána, including monthly profiling of overtime expenditure, with a view to obtaining efficiencies and value for money in the use of overtime

The national strategy specifies a number of supply reduction targets for the Garda Síochána in terms of all drug seizures and the Garda continues to achieve considerable successes in relation to these targets.The Government is aware of the increased prevalence of cocaine usage in recent times and efforts to tackle it are broadly based to include measures aimed at both supply and demand reduction, including awareness initiatives. The prevalence of cocaine usage is a matter of concern and the Garda authorities have taken a number of measures to address the problem.The Garda national drugs unit and divisional and district drug units comprise resources dedicated to reducing the supply of illicit drugs, including cocaine. These units work closely with locally based units and specialist units, including the Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.Garda strategies are aimed at undermining the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs, including cocaine. These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, including the support structures underpinning this activity, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies both within and outside the jurisdiction to address the national as well as international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution. The Garda authorities advise that these strategies continue to result in operational successes, including successes against cocaine trafficking.The Government's top policing priority for 2006 is to continue to target organised crime, including drug trafficking, and the trafficking and distribution of all illicit drugs, including cocaine, at local, national and international levels will continue to be vigilantly monitored by the Garda.The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It contains an essential updating of our law to ensure that criminal offences, including drug offences, can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. The Bill includes proposals to strengthen existing provisions relating to the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking and for the establishment of a drug offenders register.

Operation Delivery is dedicated to monitoring both the movement of cash-in-transit and ATM machines. Operations Anvil and Steel concentrate on targeting individuals involved in the unlawful carriage of firearms and those involved in criminal activities. These operations have, I am informed by the Garda authorities, been particularly successful and have resulted in the arrest and bringing before the courts of a number of persons for serious armed crime.The recent incidents highlighted to me that despite a good deal of progress having been made a radical lapse in standards has occurred. I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner and the chief executive of the Private Security Authority to discuss what further can be done to ensure that the cash-in-transit industry in Ireland is operating to the highest international standards. I support the decision of the chief executive of the Private Security Authority who has indicated her intention to bring forward, at the earliest opportunity, mandatory licensing for the cash-in-transit sector.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I can inform the Deputy that in July 2005, as part of a submission on the future resource requirements of the Garda Síochána, the Garda Commissioner proposed that, on achieving the current target strength of 14,000 members, we should proceed to expand the force to 15,000 members. Other issues in the Commissioner's submission included proposals for additional civilian staff, the establishment of a Garda Reserve, and additional resources for Garda overtime.On these other issues, I have put in place, with Government approval, a programme of redeployment of civilian staff from elsewhere in the public service to the Garda Síochána, I am proceeding with the establishment of the Garda Reserve, and the allocation in this year's Garda budget for overtime has been very significantly increased.On the question of the strength of the Garda Síochána, the recruitment drive to increase the strength to 14,000 members in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.As to the question of continuing the current recruitment drive so as to further increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 15,000, one of the first tasks I envisage for the new Garda inspectorate will be an assessment of the future resource requirements of the Garda Síochána. The inspectorate, which is provided for in the Garda Síochána Act 2005, will be made up of a chief inspector and two inspectors. The recruitment process is now under way. The purpose of the inspectorate will be to seek to ensure that the resources of the Garda Síochána are used to achieve the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness, benchmarked against best international police standards. I expect that the inspectorate's assessment will include an evaluation not only of the future case for additional gardaí, but also the case for enhanced civilian support, both administrative and technical, so as to free up gardaí for operational policing, as well as the case for more effective deployment of resources.It seems that any decision on further increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána beyond the current expansion by 2,000 members, which is an increase in strength of just over 16%, should await the outcome of such an evaluation.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I should first point out that charter flights are not the only means by which persons who are illegally resident here are removed from the State. For example, in 2005, a total of 396 persons were deported from the State, of whom 247 were removed on chartered aircraft and the remaining 149 on scheduled commercial aircraft. A further 209 persons who had first claimed asylum in another EU state were removed to those states in 2005 under the Dublin II Regulations by means of scheduled commercial aircraft and, in a small number of instances, by ferry.Furthermore, in 2005, a total of 335 persons opted for assisted voluntary repatriation to their countries of origin and these returns were affected on scheduled commercial aircraft. Of these 335 persons, 125 were directly assisted by my Department while the remaining 210 were assisted through the International Organisation for Migration, IOM, by means of specific schemes negotiated and funded by my Department.In relation to the specific question raised by the Deputy, from January 2002 to date, 22 charter flights have been engaged for the purposes of deportation of persons illegally residing in the State. A total of 675 persons were deported in this way at a total cost of €3,061,223. Details of these charter flights, that is, dates, destinations, numbers deported — broken down into adults and minors, in so far as this information is available — and individual costs are as shown in the table below.The above costs do not include Garda expenses associated with these removal operations. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that, given the wide range of immigration duties performed by the Garda Siochána and the Garda National Immigration Bureau in particular, it is not possible to identify the particular pay and overtime costs incurred by the gardaí in relation to these charter flights. However, the Commissioner informs me that charter flights involve a lower ratio of garda escorts to deportees than is the case using conventional scheduled flights, resulting in savings to the Garda budget.The number of escorting gardaí on each flight varies as it is dependent on a prior risk assessment of each removal operation carried out by the Garda National Immigration Bureau and on the policy of the particular airline. Given the large number of removal operations, it would involve a disproportionate use of Garda time and resources to provide details of the exact escort numbers used in each case. However it is usual for two escorts to accompany a single deportee, with a lower ratio used where more than one person is being removed to the same destination and on board charter flights.There are two main categories of repatriation charter flights. First, smaller charters are organised to remove disruptive deportees whom commercial airlines will not take on account of previous disruptive behaviour on board aircraft and, second, larger charters organised to return more deportees in a more efficient way. It should also be noted that Ireland does not have direct flights to those destinations where the charters have taken place, with the exception of one exceptional situation where a charter operation was arranged to transfer an extremely disruptive and violent person to Spain.As the Deputy will appreciate, the alternative to chartering is transiting through hub European airports involving longer transfer times, more inconvenience to deportees and the attendant risk of deportees absconding in transit.Charter flights, including joint charters shared by two or more countries, are used widely across the European Union as an effective and efficient means of returning persons who are illegally present on the territories of member states following the individual consideration of their cases. The European Council of Ministers adopted a decision in April 2004 facilitating the greater use of joint repatriation flights as a means of demonstrating solidarity among member states, increasing the rate of returns and making more effective use of resources.Ireland has carried out two such joint operations, namely, with the UK to Romania and Moldova on 18 November 2003 and with The Netherlands on 28 November 2003 to Romania and Bulgaria, details of which are provided in the table below.It is well established that an effective deportation process is a necessary element of any immigration system. The lack of an effective means to deport persons not granted permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the State's immigration and asylum laws.In relation to the table below, I wish to point out to the Deputy that the costs given by me in response to recent Dáil queries in respect of the first three charter operations on the table below were overstated. It transpires that in converting the payments from Irish punts to euros an incorrect IR£-€ conversion calculation was made.

These provisions have not been commenced as separate facilities for 16 and 17 year olds are not yet available.In December of last year Government agreed a series of reforms of the youth justice system, following a review carried out in my Department. The reforms require changes to the Children Act 2001, which are being addressed through amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, currently at Committee Stage before the House. These changes will include the transfer of the existing detention schools from the remit of the Department of Education and Science to my Department. The result will be a single system of detention for young people under the age of 18.The amendments to the Children Act will extend the children detention school model to 16 and 17 year olds. The children detention school model, provided for in the Children Act 2001, is designed to address the welfare, education and detention of young offenders in a manner which is based on the needs of the child, and from an age appropriate perspective. It is designed to promote the reintegration of these children into society. It will be completely separate from the adult prison system.When implemented, management responsibility for children detention services will be located in the Irish Youth Justice Service, an executive office of my Department, which will also have oversight of all other aspects of youth offending responses.The legislative, operational and administrative changes that are being advanced by it include the transfer of responsibility for the detention of young offenders under 18 years of age who have been sentenced by the courts, from the Department of Education and Science and the Irish Prison Service, to the Youth Justice Service. The net impact of these developments will be the removal of all children in detention under the age of 18 years from facilities run by the Irish Prison Service.I understand that the Youth Justice Service and the Irish Prison Service will liaise in order to address the administrative details of the transfer of responsibilities.

As the Deputy is aware Mountjoy Prison needs to be replaced. Conditions in Mountjoy have been severely criticised by the Council Of Europe's European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. They have also been roundly condemned by the Inspector of Prisons. Redeveloping the existing 20 acre site at Mountjoy is neither financially viable at an estimated cost of well in excess of €400 million nor is it practical from an operational or developmental perspective.I do not accept the Deputy's assertions that the new location will result in hardship to disadvantaged prisoners and their families. Obviously any change in location may inconvenience visitors-families who reside in the immediate proximity of the current site but equally a new site may prove more convenient for visitors from other areas. The new site at Thornton Hall is suitable in many respects, including the fact that the site is only 10 miles from O'Connell Street, a new motorway is almost complete nearby with access to the M50 and the national motorway network. In addition, consideration will be given to the provision, subject to review, of a bus service to facilitate visitors who do not have their own transport.The construction of the new facility on a greenfield site will address the inadequate facilities associated with the Mountjoy Prison complex and will, in addition, offer significant improvements in the areas of work training, education, and medical services as well as providing single cell accommodation with in-cell sanitation.

Steps are being taken to implement in the near future four of the other six recommendations, which involve bringing new workshops and educational facilities into operation, accommodating only boys under 18 years of age in the ‘B' division and painting of the walls of the recreation yard. The two remaining recommendations — replacement of St Patrick's with new facilities and separation of remand and sentenced inmates — will be achieved through development of the proposed new prison complex at Thornton, County Dublin.

A detailed breakdown of these actions in the form of the number of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other breaches of citizens' rights is not readily available. However, a database introduced in 2002 for the purposes of recording civil actions taken against members of the Garda Síochána, indicates that in 2003 — the first complete year for which a detailed breakdown is available — of the 142 actions initiated or received in that year by my Department, there were 34 cases of alleged assault recorded and 38 cases of alleged unlawful arrest recorded. The remaining 70 cases recorded included allegations of defamation and harassment. In the year 2004, 127 actions were initiated-received. They included 40 cases of alleged assault and 26 cases of alleged unlawful arrest. In the year 2005, 109 actions were initiated-received. They include 46 cases of alleged assault and 18 cases of alleged unlawful arrest. In the year 2006 to date 51 actions were initiated-received. They include 16 cases of alleged assault and five cases of alleged unlawful arrest.Civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the Garda Síochána for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. The highest percentage of these types of civil actions against the Garda Síochána is in relation to assault and unlawful arrest. The majority of these cases have been settled for less than €25,500. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State counsel.The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents which result in claims against the State in respect of the actions of gardaí are examined as appropriate with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual Garda members come into question.Year (Total Amount)AssaultUnlawful ArrestOther€€€2002 €1,240,388.40Awards1,270 (1)3,809.21 (1)56,500 (2)Settlements166,924.48 (6)106,835.58 (10)185,078.82 (11)Costs230,769.67148,714.19340,486.45Total398,964.15259,358.98582,065.272003 €1,276,127.55Awards11,000 (1)10,000 (2)4,870 (2)Settlements75,000 (4)303,011 (5)112,814.84 (4)Costs€145,561.7071,794.28542,075.73Total231,561.70384,805.28659,760.572004 €938,799.09Awards15,000 (1)03,215.06 (1)Settlements198,697.48 (5)73,007 (5)50,500 (3)Costs231,646.62100,019.36266,713.57Total445,344.10173,026.36320,428.632005 (Provisional) €4,870,233.53Awards1,000.00 (1)2,025,321.00 (8)85,125.00 (2)Settlements130,250.00 (7)1,569,114.00 (9)58,000 (2)Costs137,447.90 (10)658,508.78 (10)205,466.85 (15)Total268,697.904,252,943.78348,591.852006 as of 24/04/2006 €260,683.29 (Provisional)AwardsSettlements157,500.00 (5)49,000.00 (4)Costs22,668.21(5)21,159.96(4)10,355.12 (3)Total180,168.2170,159.9610,355.12
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I am advised by the Garda authorities that 131 Garda stations out of a total of 703 stations have video interview recording facilities — 18.63% of the total. It important to state that only a proportion of these have detention facilities. In its third report dated September, 2004, the steering committee on audio video recording of Garda questioning of detained persons reported that there was a total of 167 Garda stations with detention facilities that are used to detain and interview people. Where a Garda station is not equipped with an audio-video system, a person to be interviewed in accordance with the regulations will be taken to the nearest Garda station with such equipment.In this regard, it should be noted that it was never the intention that all Garda stations would be equipped to carry out audio-video recording of interviews. Rather the intention was that a sufficient number of interview rooms in Garda stations across the country be equipped to provide a broad nationwide coverage. In this context, the Garda authorities have advised me that, in June 2005, a Garda survey indicated that 98.1% of interviews as specified in the regulations were being recorded. Interviews are not recorded mainly because either the arrested person declines to have the interview recorded or the equipment is already in use or is otherwise unavailable.With regard to future and additional requirements I am advised that the Garda Commissioner is proceeding to prepare a tender for issue to the market for the provision of additional audio video systems.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The Deputy refers to the survey into public attitudes on crime and law enforcement which was conducted by TNS mrbi on behalf of my Department.Looking at long- term crime trends, the level of headline crime in 2005 was lower than that in 2003 by 1.6% and that in 2002 by 4.4%. Furthermore, in 1995, when we had a population of almost 3.6 million, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population, while in 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population. This represents a 15% decrease in crimes per 1,000 of the population.I am determined that disturbing trends will be addressed as they are identified and, despite an increasing population, we should continue to enjoy relatively low crime rates. High on the Government's list of policing priorities for 2006, which have been incorporated into the Garda Síochána policing plan, is the continued targeting of organised crime, including drug trafficking and the gun culture associated with it through the use of specialist units and targeted, intelligence-led operations. Garda strategies are in place for dealing with drug offences which are designed to undermine the activities of organised criminal networks involved in the trafficking and distribution of illicit drugs. These strategies include gathering intelligence on individuals and organisations involved in the distribution of drugs, conducting targeted operations on criminal networks based on intelligence gathered and working in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, both within and outside the jurisdiction, to address the national and international aspects of drug trafficking and distribution. These strategies continue to result in operational successes.While it is the case that a number of the increases in headline crime statistics reflect increased enforcement activity on the part of the Garda Síochána, the overall picture indicates there is no room for complacency. The Government's decision to continue to devote unprecedented resources to the fight against crime shows that it is not complacent, as does my insistence that those resources be deployed at the front line of policing in the State.The Garda Síochána this year has the highest level of resources in its history. A sum of €1,290 million has been allocated, which is an increase of €146 million or 13% on 2005 and of over 100% on 1997. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is €83.5 million, which is an increase of €23 million on the allocation for 2005. This latter increase is greatly assisting the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention. The €83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.Implementation is well advanced on the Government's decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result, there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 in 2006 and 14,000 attested gardaí in two years' time. The Commissioner is now drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources in the areas where they are most needed. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of newly attested gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested gardaí will come on stream every 90 days from here on in.The Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda Síochána in the investigation and prosecution of offences. It updates our laws to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society. It addresses such matters as the preservation of crime scenes, increased periods of detention in the case of arrestable offences, a general power of search in connection with all arrestable offences and powers for the Garda Síochána to issue search warrants in circumstances of urgency. The Bill also contains amendments to the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, with provision for a fixed penalty procedure in respect of certain lesser public order offences and the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements.It is widely acknowledged that our legislative provisions for tackling crime, especially serious and organised crime, is already one of the toughest in Europe. Nevertheless, I have brought forward a range of proposed additions to the Bill. Among these are the creation of criminal offences in connection with organised crime, the strengthening of provisions on the imposition of the ten year mandatory minimum sentence for drug trafficking, new offences of supplying drugs to prisons as well as provisions for the establishment of a drug offenders register, provisions for dealing with anti-social behaviour, and provision to deal with the Supreme Court decision that a judge could not issue warrants if he or she was outside his or her district. Further additions include new provisions to allow the courts to suspend or partially suspend or to adjourn sentences on conditions which will motivate the offender to stay away from crime, such as participation in drug treatment programmes and provision to allow for restriction of movement orders including electronic monitoring.Due to my concern about firearms in general and in order to ensure public safety and security, I propose to bring forward a wide range of amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000 in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill. Included in these new proposals are measures which will require all persons wishing to legally hold a firearm to satisfy the Garda Síochána that they have provided secure accommodation for the firearm. Further proposed measures will allow the Minister to deem certain firearms as restricted by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre, action type and muzzle energy of the firearm. In future any person wishing to obtain a certificate for such a firearm will have to apply directly to the Garda Commissioner. The Bill will introduce new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as sawing-off a shotgun and increase fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts. It will also create mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.I also intend to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, thus enabling the Garda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders.A comprehensive package of proposals on juvenile justice issues has been brought forward by means of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill by my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan.The enactment of this Bill is a top priority and I hope to see it on the Statute Book by the summer. I assure the Deputy that the legal, operational measures and resources in place to tackle crime are kept under continuing review and any further measures and resources which are required will be made available.

I am advised by the Garda authorities that they have the use of 12 Army firing ranges, countrywide, to facilitate Garda firearms training.The number of gardaí who carry arms on duty at any particular time is an operational matter for the Commissioner. I have made it clear in the past that the traditional unarmed character of the Garda Síochána has always been one of its key strengths in maintaining its public reputation as an approachable force which polices by consent and not by fear. That is a tradition which any reasonable member of the public would want to see continued. Instruction governing the use of firearms and practical or tactical training is provided for each firearm on issue to the Garda Síochána. Members must achieve the necessary skills and standards to meet the aims and objectives for each firearms course. There is also an ongoing annual re-certification programme, which includes refresher training.Members of the Garda Síochána who successfully complete the relevant firearms training course are issued with a certificate of competency in the particular firearm. In order to carry a firearm on duty, the member's chief superintendent must issue the member with a firearm authorisation card. The total number of firearms cards issued for the year ending 31 December 2005 was 3,631. Responsibility for the use of a firearm rests with the individual garda in accordance with the instructions.Discussions have been ongoing with the Defence Forces regarding the future use of their facilities. In this regard, the Garda authorities have submitted proposals to my Department for the future provision of two Garda firearm training facilities. These proposals are being progressed as a matter of urgency.It is intended to provide a new centre of excellence for the Garda college. This centre will cater for a broad range of training requirements for the force, including facilities for firearms training. A number of possible sites for this development have been identified and are currently being assessed by the Office of Public Works.In addition, it is intended to totally refurbish and update the indoor firing range in Garda headquarters and to this end, the Garda authorities have been working with an external consultant with expertise in this area and a report will be submitted to the Garda Commissioner shortly. Once the Commissioner has considered the report, I expect a proposal to be submitted to my Department.

Where problems have arisen they have related mainly to the need to impose financial restrictions across the Prison Service in recent years against the backdrop of the industrial relations situation prior to agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on the proposal for organisational change in the Irish Prison Service. While every effort was made to minimise the impact of these restrictions, there was disruption to prisoner programmes and curtailment of planned initiatives. This situation is being reversed as the organisational change programme becomes established and is brought into full operation.In this regard, the re-opening of newly renovated workshops and the assignment of newly created industrial supervisor posts in the coming weeks will facilitate progress in this area. It is also hoped to bring new education facilities at St. Patrick's into operation in the near future. I have been assured by the director general of the Irish Prison Service that he regards the issue of the regime for prisoners in St. Patrick's as a major priority.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I have recently brought forward proposals concerning anti-social behaviour, including anti-social behaviour orders, as Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004.The Deputy refers to the concerns expressed by the chief executive of Barnardos UK regarding the alleged routine use of anti-social behaviour orders for children in that jurisdiction.I assure the Deputy that in formulating my proposals I have examined the UK law and its application closely. I have worked closely with my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in preparing my proposals. The Deputy will be aware that, unlike the position in the UK, the proposals Deputy Lenihan and I have brought forward will establish separate arrangements with regard to adults and children. This ensures that elements are included in the arrangements pertaining to children that are appropriate to their circumstances and needs.While the UK approach is considered to have provided welcome relief to many communities I am aware that it has been the subject of some criticisms, in particular that anti-social behaviour orders have been used in inappropriate cases. Having regard to these criticisms, the proposals to be included in the Criminal Justice Bill do not follow the UK model in many respects. In particular the proposals, in the case of both adults and children, incorporate a range of safeguards to ensure that anti-social behaviour orders will only be sought as a last resort. The definition of anti-social behaviour is designed to ensure that the orders are used to meet the real and serious needs of communities. Only the Garda Síochána, of at least superintendent rank, will be empowered to apply to the courts for orders, whereas in the UK, local authorities may also apply. Before the making of an application for an order may be considered, there will first be an explicit duty to formally warn a person to cease the offending behaviour, which is not the case in the UK. The court will be able to grant legal aid in appropriate cases and may only grant the application if it considers an order is a reasonable and proportionate remedy. The orders will operate for a maximum of two years, unlike the UK where they operate for a minimum of two years. Full rights to appeal against an order or to have it varied are being provided and the penalties for breach of an order will be a maximum of six months imprisonment. In the UK, the maximum penalty is five years' imprisonment.The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has brought forward separate proposals to amend the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 to deal with anti-social behaviour by children, that is, persons aged 12 but under 18. Those proposals are framed in the context of the overall philosophy and policy that underpins the Children Act 2001 and therefore contain additional features to the proposals in relation to adults. Every effort is made to provide an opportunity for the child and his or her parents or guardians to address the behavioural problems in a way that minimises contact with the criminal justice system. For instance, where a child has been issued with a behaviour warning by a garda, the local superintendent, on the basis of a report from a garda in the district, may convene a meeting to discuss the child's behaviour. The meeting will be attended by the child, his or her parents or guardian, the garda who issued the warning and, as appropriate, the juvenile liaison officer and any other person whom the superintendent thinks may assist the child. The meeting may result in a good behaviour contract. The question of admitting the child to the diversion programme or making an application to the courts for a behaviour order only arises where the superintendent, having considered the report from the garda in the district, does not consider that convening a meeting would help to prevent anti-social behaviour by the child concerned or the meeting was convened but a good behaviour contract was not prepared because the child or the parents or guardians refused to give the necessary undertakings or the child breached an undertaking given by him or her. Parents or guardians are to be involved at all important stages of the procedures.It will be clear from the foregoing that the whole thrust of my proposals with regard to both adults and children is that an application to the courts for an order will arise only as a last resort. It will also be clear that the proposals concerning children already deal with many of the concerns raised by the chief executive of Barnardos regarding the operation of anti-social behaviour orders for children in the UK.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.The personnel strength, all ranks, of the Dublin metropolitan region as at 31 December, 1996 to 2005, inclusive, is as set out in the table hereunder:YearStrength31/12/963,52931/12/973,40831/12/983,40431/12/993,43931/12/003,52031/12/013,47931/12/023,51631/12/033,58031/12/043,74031/12/053,749The Dublin metropolitan region's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units which operate extensively, but not exclusively, in Dublin.Care must be taken in any comparison of Garda strength at fixed dates, such as the end of each year. For example, the figure of 3,749 for the end of 2005 does not include 50 personnel from uniform service in Dublin stations who were transferred to the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations in November 2005 to deal exclusively with criminals involved in gun crime in the Dublin metropolitan region. Nor does it include a further nine personnel who were allocated to the other national units.It is also the case that comparisons using different dates can yield different results. For example, Garda strength in the Dublin metropolitan region last month was 3,801 compared to 3,685 in March of 2005, an increase of 116. The figure for last month does not include the 59 personnel transferred to the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations and other national Dublin-based units.There are also 147 officers in the Dublin traffic unit and 99 officers in Dublin command and control. This brings the overall strength in the Dublin region to over 4,040 personnel. This does not the include hundreds of officers in special units who operate extensively, but not exclusively in Dublin.A particular factor in fluctuations in Garda strength is the fact that while Garda retirements are spread throughout the year, Garda attestations, where recruits become sworn members of the force, only take place four times a year, leading to step increases in strength. Clearly, comparisons of strength can vary significantly depending on how close to an attestation they are made. What matters is the trend in Garda strength and that trend is now significantly upward. Garda strength is now more than 16% higher than at June 1997. In addition, the recruitment drive to increase the strength of the force to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of the year.The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Dublin metropolitan region will be given the fullest consideration.

The report of that evaluation contained a number of recommendations.The amendments to the criminal law which would be needed to implement these recommendations are being assessed by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. These amendments are being evaluated in conjunction with those arising from the provisions of the third EU anti-money laundering directive, which was agreed in late 2005. Any legislative proposals will be submitted to Government for approval in the normal way.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I assume the Deputy is referring specifically to section 5(6)(a) of the Immigration Act 1999, which provides that a person who is the subject of a deportation order may, in certain circumstances, be detained for a period not exceeding eight weeks in aggregate. For the reasons set out below I am satisfied that this law fully conforms with international human rights standards.It is important to point out that persons who are made the subject of a deportation order are first given the opportunity to voluntarily report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau for the purposes of arranging their deportation from the State. Persons who comply with the reporting requirements will not be arrested and detained.Under section 3(10) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, a person who contravenes a provision of a deportation order or a requirement to report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau is deemed to be guilty of an offence. Section 5(1) of the same Act provides that such a person may be arrested and detained for the purposes of deportation. In accordance with the provisions of section 5(6)(a) of the Act, the period of detention may not exceed eight weeks in aggregate. Most persons, however, are detained for periods of less than eight weeks because the sole purpose of the detention is to ensure that the person will co-operate in making arrangements, such as securing travel documents and so forth.The eight-week detention period can be suspended for a number of reasons, including the challenging of the validity of the deportation order in court proceedings, as provided for in section 5(6)(b) of the Act. In such a circumstance, the court may decide to release the person on condition that he or she resides at a particular address, reports at regular intervals to the Garda Siochána or surrenders any passport or travel document in his or her possession. This ensures that a person will not be left in detention for an extended period awaiting the court’s hearing of his or her case.The Supreme Court has considered the constitutionality of certain amendments to the Immigration Act 1999, including the extended grounds for detention as now provided for in section 5(1) in the Act, as referred to above. The court's decision of 28 August 2000 held, with regard to detention on foot of a deportation order, that "in all the circumstances the safeguards which do in fact exist and which will be outlined further in this judgement are perfectly adequate to meet the requirements of the Constitution.".The safeguards to which the court referred include the right to challenge, by judicial review, the validity of the deportation order. Moreover, the court held that the extended grounds for detention would not contravene Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.In light of the Supreme Court's findings in this area, I am satisfied that the State's laws governing immigration-related detention are in full conformity with international human rights standards and I do not propose to make any legislative change in this area.

These new measures include increases in fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts and the creation of mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.In this context I also propose to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before the proposed new penalties and minimum mandatory sentences are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, thus enabling the Garda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders.

I assure the Deputy that I am in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner in order to keep the measures and resources for tackling serious crime under continuing review and to this end, I will continue to ensure that every necessary resource is made available to the Garda Síochána.In this regard, I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda Síochána as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.The recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the first group of newly attested gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested gardaí will come on stream every 90 days from here on in.In financial terms, too, the Garda Síochána has never been as well resourced, with the 2006 budget at an historic high of €1.275 billion. In particular, the 2006 overtime allocation has risen to €83.5 million, which represents a major increase of 36.6% over the allocation of €61.1 million for 2005 and will allow the Garda Síochána to intensify further its crime detection and investigation capabilities.Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin metropolitan region on 17 May 2005 with a view to addressing the problem of serious crime such as gun crime, robberies and burglaries and combating an emerging gun culture. At my request, Operation Anvil is being extended outside the Dublin metropolitan region during 2006. I have also obtained funding to enable Operation Anvil to continue as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms. Operation anvil has contributed to encouraging successes across a number of headings. As of 23 April this year, 505 firearms have been seized or recovered and 2,314 arrests have been made.The Garda Síochána employs a range of techniques and expertise in the fight against organised crime. The establishment of specialist Garda units, operating under the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime more effectively. The National Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the Garda specialist unit charged with the role of tackling organised crime. It carries out this role by conducting intelligence-driven operations in close co-operation with other specialist units including the Garda national drugs unit, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.The Garda authorities are also satisfied that the technology required to assist in the fight against crime is available to them. The Garda Síochána constantly evaluates all available technology with a view to determining the technology best suited to its needs. Significant resources are being invested in technology for the Garda Síochána to assist it in the exercise of all its functions. The capital allocation for information technology in 2006 is €33.323 million. The allocation for communications is €12.9 million.

The Ombudsman submitted detailed advice concerning the proposed changes to the Children Act to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on 5 April 2006, which he has brought to my attention. The Minister of State and I are carefully considering the Ombudsman's advice and I will table further amendments to take account of her advice where they are deemed to be necessary.

Of these, speeding accounted for 1,738 notices, non-wearing of seat belts for 382 notices and new offences, introduced on 3 April 2006, for 1,541 notices.An additional 60 members of the Garda Síochána, as well as 28 new vehicles, have been allocated to the traffic corps in the first quarter of this year. It is intended that the numbers in the traffic corps will be increased by 60 each quarter this year, to reach a total complement of 805 at the end of 2006. Between now and 2008, the traffic corps will increase its numbers to a complement of 1,200.The Garda Síochána is supplied with an electronic copy of the national driver file by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the purpose of processing payments in respect of fixed-charge penalty point offences. Details of payment received by the Garda Síochána in respect of fixed-charge penalty point offences are forwarded to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the purpose of applying penalty points to the driver licence record.Hand-held terminals have been provided for the capture of data on fixed-charge incidents at the roadside so that the data can be efficiently and accurately uploaded to the fixed charge processing system. The Garda authorities are currently examining ways to allow gardaí to access certain data, such as disqualifications, from the national driver file using this hand-held technology.

The group's report was published on 21 March 2006 following its approval by the Government. The report includes a wide-ranging set of conclusions and recommendations covering the full spectrum of public service activity relating specifically to the Traveller community. One section of the report examines the extent to which data on Travellers are currently available and includes a recommendation that a Travellers' data strategy should be developed within the context of wider data collection structures.The 2006 Census includes a question on membership of the Traveller community as part of a general question on ethnic or cultural background. The high level group report notes that work is continuing at a strategic level work under the guidance of the senior officials group on social inclusion and the National Statistics Board to develop a comprehensive framework for social and equality statistics to respond to the evolving data needs of policy makers. The office for social inclusion is also working to address data gaps, focusing particularly on vulnerable groups, in the context of the development of a data strategy to underpin the national anti-poverty strategy.The high level group proposed that a subset of this work might involve the establishment of a small working group comprising my Department, the Central Statistics Office, the office for social inclusion and other relevant Departments to develop a Travellers' data strategy. The matter is being progressed and will be given ongoing attention by the high level group.

The Secretary General added that the nature of the information received prevented him from making any further comments on individual countries at this stage. For obvious reasons, I am not in a position to clarify any aspect of the Secretary General's statement. I await the publication of his final report.As stated in Ireland's publicly-available reply to the Secretary General's Article 52 enquiry, the actions of all persons present in the territory of Ireland are governed by Irish law, including that relating to the deprivation of liberty. Ireland has fulfilled all of its positive obligations in respect of preventing unacknowledged deprivation of liberty, including the active investigation by the Garda Síochána of specific allegations relating to so-called extraordinary rendition flights.

This proposal is primarily to cater for the substantial increase in membership of the force now under way. It also aims to increase the number of these posts in front line policing. The increase in strength of specialist units over the last five years has considerably strengthened the hand of the Garda Síochána in the fight against crime, but one of the consequences has been to put pressure on the availability of members in middle management for front line policing. In addition, we also have operations, such as Freeflow and Anvil, which involve a heavy commitment of uniform personnel. It is also true that recent developments in the training and development of members have put upward pressure on the number of sergeants and inspectors required.I am supportive of the case for an increase in the number of sergeant and inspector posts and I note that the case for this has also been recognised by the group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, which recently reported on the implementation of the Garda Siochána Act 2005. It is my intention to submit proposals to Government in the coming weeks on the issue.

I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner about these incidents and I am satisfied that detailed thorough investigations are taking place into all aspects of these robberies. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no evidence to indicate that any criminal gang had inside knowledge regarding the movements of cash-in-transit vehicles. Where such information comes to the attention of the Garda Síochána, it is fully investigated and appropriate action is taken.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I share the concerns expressed about anti-social behaviour and its effects on people. In many such incidents, vulnerable people, often the elderly, are subjected to serious nuisance and forms of harassment which cause significant and persistent distress to the people concerned and interfere fundamentally with their capacity to enjoy quiet and peaceful lives. Often such people are simply too frightened to stand up to their persecutors. Equally, few of them have the financial resources to engage lawyers to seek private law injunction-type remedies to protect their rights to enjoyment of their property.To remedy this situation I intend to empower a senior officer of the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court by way of civil procedure for an order which would prohibit a person from behaving in an anti-social manner. Similar to civil injunctions, breaches of which are punishable as a criminal contempt, a breach of such an order will be a criminal offence. This type of order is not an entirely new concept. Such an order is simply a mechanism whereby the law seeks to stop a person from behaving in a way which is causing significant distress to a community or to some person in that community. In this respect the principle behind such anti-social behaviour orders is similar to the judicial power to bind over, which is a very old power indeed.I have brought forward these proposals by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I attach top priority to the enactment of this Bill and hope to see it complete its passage through the Dáil and Seanad without any undue delay.Strong provisions are in place to combat vandalism and anti-social behaviour. The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard. Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I have brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One of the provisions of the Act is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was originally introduced to combat under-age drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off licences, late night clubs and food premises where there is disorder or noise on or close to the premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals convicted of a range of public order offences, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána has a proactive approach to policing anti-social-public disorder issues by immediate intervention, arrest and prosecutions or advice, as appropriate. Garda management makes every effort to provide a high visible police presence on the streets of our towns and villages through the deployment of uniform, detective units, divisional traffic corps, community policing units and mountain bike units as appropriate.Under the Garda juvenile diversion programme divisional juvenile liaison officers regularly visit schools, youth clubs and social services to give presentations under the education programme and highlight alternative options for regular offenders. Community gardaí and the Garda schools liaison officers also visit schools and address young people on a variety of topics including anti social behaviour.Members of the Garda Síochána are frequently in contact with other Government and non-government agencies, including the Health Services Executive and the local authorities in order to have a multi-agency approach to addressing criminal issues. This multi-agency liaison will continue.I am further informed that Operation Encounter, which was introduced by Garda management in 2002, targets public disorder offences including assaults and offences committed by underage persons under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1998. In excess of 337,000 offences have been detected up to 26 March this year under Operation Encounter. This figure is provisional, operational and is liable to change.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda Síochána as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength of both attested gardaí and recruits in training of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.Garda management further states that a total of 2,342 recruits have been attested to the Garda Síochána since 6 June 2002. I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that 2,125 recruits have graduated from the Garda college since 6 June 2002.Garda management states that a total of 1,696 members, all ranks, have resigned, retired or otherwise left the Garda Síochána since 6 June 2002. The operational strength of the Garda Síochána has always included attested officers. Therefore, the strength of the force has increased by 646 since I was appointed Minister. The first group of newly attested gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested gardaí will come on stream every 90 days from here on in.It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel throughout and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of such resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs. Garda personnel assignments throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.

Accordingly, I would not favour any restriction being placed on the types of offence for which telecommunications data may be accessed. In this regard, unlike the Data Protection Commissioner, I cannot confine myself solely to a data protection perspective but must consider the broader issues of public safety.With specific regard to the aforementioned directive, I am considering bringing a legal challenge before the European Court of Justice to its final text, because I fundamentally disagree with the EU's legal base on which it is set and believe that it is in breach of the EU treaties.

Arrangements have also been put in place so as to facilitate the implementation by the tribunal of the EU directive dealing with compensation for crime victims, which came into effect on 1 January 2006.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	415	On 7 April, I met with senior representatives of the major cash-in-transit companies, the major financial institutions and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. I convened this meeting in the aftermath of armed raids on cash-in-transit vehicles in the previous week and two foiled attempts the previous day.At a very frank and positive meeting, I impressed upon all stakeholders the absolute priority of ensuring that the movement of cash in the State would be governed by best practice. The stakeholders reported to me on progress being made in implementing the agreed voluntary code of practice. While I was heartened to learn from the meeting that a continuous strategy of improvement is now in place, I informed the companies that I would like to speed up these reforms and that there was a need to ensure continuous improvement in standards on the part of the financial institutions and the security companies.I told the meeting that I supported the decision of the chief executive of the Private Security Authority who had indicated her intention to bring forward, at the earliest opportunity, licensing for the cash-in-transit sector of the security industry. I also confirmed that adherence to the code of practice will be an integral part of the licensing regime and the companies who do not comply with the code of practice will not be licensed to operate in the cash movement sector. In this context, I stated that I was prepared to discuss any difficulties being experienced by the companies while underlining that all those in the cash movement business must take full responsibility for the security of the cash in their care at all points along the supply chain.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I have received a copy of the recently published third report of the ISPAI hotline which was launched recently by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and I have noted its contents.Child pornography is illegal in this jurisdiction and in most other jurisdictions throughout the world. Under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998, one of the most robust Acts anywhere, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography — films, videos, or material in written or auditory form, including material produced or transmitted via the Internet — are offences with penalties of up to 14 years' imprisonment. Mere possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up to five years. Using a child or allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography is also punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment. The Garda Síochána is committed to the investigation of all cases of child pornography and the importance of investigating the child protection issues involved in such cases.In Ireland, as well as in most jurisdictions, what is illegal off-line is considered illegal on-line. Irish Internet service providers will not therefore accept such material for hosting on their servers whether generated in this jurisdiction or elsewhere, and will report any such material to the gardaí.Measures to combat child pornography on the Internet, however, are hampered by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems and differing societal norms. Furthermore, developments in new communications technologies allow for Internet access from many means other than the traditional personal computer. For these reasons, combating the production and availability of child pornography on the Internet requires a combination of responses, and the co-operation of all the stakeholders at national and international level — legislators, law enforcement, service providers, schools, child protection practitioners, and most important of all, parents and guardians.A system of self-regulation by the Internet service provider industry is in place which helps to ensure that child pornography and other material illegal in this jurisdiction is not made available on Irish servers. The self-regulatory approach to Internet regulation is the norm at EU level and worldwide. The components of this self-regulatory system are an Internet advisory board which promotes awareness of Internet downside issues and monitors the progress of self regulation by the Internet service provider industry, a public hotline for reporting child pornography and an industry code of practice and ethics setting out the duties and responsibilities of each Internet service provider. The Irish code of practice and ethics is recognised throughout Europe as a model of its type.As well as overseeing a self-regulatory regime for the Irish Internet service providers, the Internet advisory board encourages best practice procedures, provides advice and facilitates research in Internet-related issues including child safety. My Department provides secretarial and other supports for the board's work.The hotline, www.hotline.ie, funded by the Internet Service Providers’ Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan, accepts and investigates reports from the public about child pornography and other illegal material on the internet. Special protocols operate between the gardaí and the hotline which maximise co-operation on law enforcement issues so that offences in the area of child pornography can be detected and prosecuted. While the hotline’s recently published third report, covering the period July 2003 to December 2005, shows increasing levels of reporting of potentially illegal material by the public, no case where the material was confirmed as referring to illegal child pornography was traced as either hosted in or distributed from Ireland.The hotline works closely with, and is a founding member of the international INHOPE Association, www.inhope.org a network of European hotlines which is expanding to all parts of the world. The INHOPE Association develops procedures and shares information on the best practices for the tracing and tracking of illegal child pornography.The European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful uses of the Internet. Since 1999, under the Safer Internet Action Plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the Internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children. A new EU action plan, Safer Internet Plus, covering the period 2005-08, and with a budget of €45 million, was agreed under the Irish Presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation. The Department is represented on the management committee for the programme.The EU Council adopted a Framework Decision on Combating the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornography on 22 December 2003. While Ireland's Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 is a particularly robust legislative measure, the Department is preparing additional legislative provisions to ensure compliance with this framework decision.Ireland signed up to the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime in June 2002. The main objective of the convention is to foster international co-operation in protecting society against cybercrime. The convention deals specifically with the distribution of child pornography on the Internet, infringements of copyright, computer related fraud and violations of network security.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	418	A voluntary code of practice, which sets out the agreed principles and minimum standards for the movement of cash was signed on 24 June 2005. Its objective is to encourage the highest standards of operation and, having due regard to the specific circumstances of each organisation, the implementation of integrated end-to-end solutions to create safe secure and efficient cash handling.The requirements of the code took effect on the date of signing and were to be implemented in full by the stakeholders as soon as possible thereafter, but not later than 31 December 2006. The code does not preclude stakeholders from taking more stringent measures than those provided for in the code.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the implementation process is well under way and all stakeholders are actively sourcing improved methods of cash delivery, collection and storage which will be in keeping with the physical, electronic and procedural requirements of the code.The Garda Síochána, working in co-operation with representatives from each of the stakeholder groups, financial institutions and CIT service providers has developed draft guidance notes for the installation of physical, electronic, and procedural security enhancements throughout their entire networks. Also, with the assistance of the Garda Síochána, each stakeholder has commenced risk assessments of its various locations: branches, off-site ATMs, bunkers and cash centres. These assessments have highlighted various risks and hazards associated with such locations and will also attempt to identify ways and means to control or eliminate such risks or hazards for the future.While all of this represents significant progress, there have been recent incidents where serious lapses in standards occurred. I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner and the chief executive of the Private Security Authority to discuss what further can be done to ensure that the cash-in-transit industry in Ireland is operating to the highest international standards. I support the decision of the chief executive of the Private Security Authority, who has indicated her intention to bring forward, at the earliest opportunity, mandatory licensing for the cash-in-transit sector of the security industry. I also confirmed with her that strict adherence to the code of practice will be an integral part of the licensing regime and companies who do not comply with the code of practice will not be licensed to operate in the cash movement sector.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	419	My attention has been drawn to issues raised by delegates to the recent annual conference of the AGSI regarding the level of medical support available to the Garda Síochána in dealing with both crime suspects and victims of crime, especially rape or other sexual assaults.The Irish Medical Organisation wrote to my Department in March of this year on these issues. Subsequently, the Garda Síochána met with the IMO regarding the provision of medical services to the force. These discussions focused on the need to enhance the provision of medical services currently available. Gardaí need to have medical personnel available for a variety of issues on a 24 hour basis, for example in the context of the treatment of persons detained at Garda stations. Arising from these discussions, the Commissioner has now made a submission to the Department setting the objective of a properly structured and effective medical service for the force. The Department will now engage with the relevant stakeholders with the aim of securing agreement on the arrangements necessary to achieve this.On the very important issue of the availability of forensic medical services for victims of rape and other sexual assaults, I understand that the National Steering Committee on Violence Against Women was party to a working group chaired by the Department of Health and Children on sexual assault treatment units. The report is due to be published shortly by that Department, and I will take any necessary action to appropriately address any resource requirements which arise from it relating to the provision of medical services to assist the Garda Síochána.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	420	The most immediate response to the reports of the Morris tribunal was to address the cases of individual wrongdoing or gross negligence uncovered. Following publication of the first report a superintendent was dismissed by the Government. Two superintendents criticised in the second report subsequently retired. Disciplinary action in respect of members of the force below the rank of superintendent is a matter for the Commissioner and there were a number of dismissals and retirements following publication of both reports.A wider response was necessary however to address the system failures identified in both reports. That response is contained in the Garda Síochána Act 2005. The Act represents the most fundamental restatement of the oversight and accountability relationship between the Garda Síochána and both the Minister and the Government since the foundation of the State.The Act establishes the new Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission to replace the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. The three person Ombudsman Commission will provide for a more robust and effective complaints system that will promote public confidence in the force. The Ombudsman Commission will be empowered to directly and independently investigate complaints against members of the Garda Síochána. It will also be able to investigate any matter, even where no complaint has been made, where it appears that a member of the force may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that would justify disciplinary proceedings. Furthermore the commission may investigate any practice, policy or procedure of the Garda Síochána with a view to reducing the incidence of related complaints.The Act also provides for the establishment of a Garda Síochána inspectorate to ensure that the resources of the Garda Síochána are used to achieve the highest levels of efficiency and effectiveness compared to best international police practice and standards. The inspectorate will monitor the operation and administration of the force and report to the Minister. Reports of the inspectorate will be laid before both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and the chief inspector will, when requested, attend before any relevant Oireachtas committee in connection with any such report. Plans are well advanced for the selection and appointment of members of the Garda Síochána inspectorate. The search and selection process to recruit the chief inspector has recently been conducted by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, in conjunction with the Department. Contract negotiations with the successful candidate are being finalised. The advertisement of the posts for the other two members of the inspectorate is imminent and I hope the inspectorate will be operational in the coming months.A firm conclusion of the tribunal was that gardaí should be required to account for their actions on duty without delay, and without the need for applications to court. An amendment brought forward on Report Stage of the Bill gives statutory effect to such a requirement. Such a duty, vigorously implemented, should in many cases obviate the necessity for more involved investigations and should greatly assist not only the internal management of the Garda Síochána, but also the Ombudsman Commission in its investigations.On the need for greater accountability identified in the tribunal's reports, there are provisions in the Act which oblige the Commissioner to inform the Minister, through the Secretary General of the Department, of any development which might adversely affect public confidence in the force, and which also oblige the Commissioner to supply any information necessary for the Minister to discharge his duties towards the Houses of the Oireachtas.The tribunal in its first report was of the view that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should look at the system of promotions in consultation with the Garda Commissioner. The Act specifies that in future each promotion board will have a non-Garda majority and in every case one of the non-Garda members will be appointed as chairperson.New powers have been given to the Commissioner to dismiss members of the force. The relevant provision enables the Commissioner to dismiss a member of garda, sergeant or inspector rank where the Commissioner has lost confidence in the capacity of the member to discharge his or her duty and where dismissal is considered necessary to maintain public confidence in the force. This power of dismissal is separate and distinct from disciplinary regulations, which will continue to apply in cases of specific allegations of misconduct, and corresponds to a similar power which Government has in the more senior ranks.The tribunal in both reports spoke of the desirability of recruiting members of the Garda Síochána from religious and ethnic minorities. The Act, in providing for regulations on the admission, appointment and enrolment of members, makes specific reference to the recruitment of members with different ethnic or national origins or different religious beliefs or backgrounds. Already the first competition with revised eligibility criteria has taken place and I am encouraged by the response to date. The new provision also facilitates the transfer into the Garda Síochána of experienced police officers from other forces at different ranks which was another important recommendation in the second report of the tribunal.Implementation of the provisions of the Act was a key priority of the Government and in order to ensure that this should happen in an ordered and timely fashion I established an implementation review group under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes. The group submitted their report to me in December last and I published it on 10 February. The report records that substantial and satisfactory progress has been made on the implementation of the principal provisions of the Act.Most of the provisions of the Act have already been commenced. The three members of the Ombudsman Commission were appointed by the President in February. Plans are also well advanced for the selection and appointment of members of the Garda Síochána inspectorate. Guidelines for the establishment of joint policing committees, another key feature of the Act, are being finalised and will be issued shortly. Preparations are continuing to make the Garda Commissioner the accounting officer for the force. The target date for this is 1 July of this year. The Act also provides that civilian staff working in the Garda area will become staff of the Garda Commissioner. Separate discussions are taking place under industrial relations machinery to effect a smooth transition to the new arrangements.I am confident that the measures I have included in the Act are a comprehensive and strong response to the recommendations of the tribunal which required statutory change.In parallel with all of this, the Commissioner has also been implementing a significant programme of change in response to the findings and conclusions of the tribunal's first report, including improved record-keeping, a new registration system for intelligence sources and more stable tenure of position in senior Garda management. Full details of the Commissioner's response are set out in a report which is available on the Garda Síochána website. The Commissioner is also now considering what further change might be required by the tribunal's second report. Issues arising in the second report are being examined under following headings, review of role of crime and security branch, external professional assistance, training, reporting within the Garda Síochána including reporting to the Department and professional and ethical conduct.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength, all ranks, of the Garda Síochána as at 31 March 2006 was 12,439. This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel across and within divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas. The allocation of such resources is determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Garda resources assigned to the Border areas, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that the best possible use is made of existing Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.In this regard, I am advised by the Garda authorities that local Garda management along the Border is satisfied that sufficient resources are available to address criminal activity in these regions. It should be noted that the necessity for a disproportionately large Garda presence in the Border counties has significantly diminished since the Good Friday Agreement.Each division's resources are augmented by the deployment of divisional and national specialist units such as the divisional drugs and crime units, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB. In each division crime trends are continually being analysed. Any crime hotspots are identified and resources allocated and deployed accordingly.As regards cross-Border co-operation in tackling crime, local Garda management is committed to the investigation and detection of local crimes and work in partnership with the Police Service of Northern Ireland to identify perpetrators living outside the jurisdiction. These close working relationships have delivered results, with some persons currently before the courts awaiting trial.Two specific operations have been introduced in 2006 as part of Garda strategies to prevent crime in Border areas. Operation Cougar is a joint operation with the PSNI and was introduced in an effort to curb a number of serious crime incidents which have a cross-Border dimension and operates in the Garda Donegal division. The operation includes simultaneous checkpoints on both sides of the Border and enhanced communications between units on the ground. In addition, there is good co-operation with the PSNI at local level with monthly crime meetings being held on both sides of the Border. In addition, Operation Anvil, which has been extended nationwide, involves specific crime patrols of Border areas.In response to the changing policing needs of the areas concerned, smaller stations along the Border are not open on a 24 hour basis. These adjustments in opening times release valuable resources to allow additional patrolling within the Garda districts along the Border. The members attached to those stations carry out patrols and checkpoints on a 24 hour basis in each district, thus ensuring availability and presence of gardaí at all times.The current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and a further 275 newly attested gardaí will come on stream every 90 days from here on in.The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Border areas will be given the fullest consideration.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda Síochána has legislative powers to photograph suspects who have been detained under the provision of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, as amended, the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and suspects arrested under the provision of section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939, as amended. Nothing prevents a member of the Garda Síochána taking a photograph of a suspect in a public place.Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, seeks to provide that, on the authority of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant, a person arrested by a member of the Garda Síochána may be photographed in a Garda Síochána station after his or her arrest. A photograph taken in these circumstances may be used only to assist in the identification of the arrested person in connection with any proceedings which may be instituted against him or her in respect of the offence for which he or she was arrested.This provision stems from the recommendations of the expert group appointed to consider changes in the criminal law which were recommended in the Garda SMI report. The expert group noted that at present under section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 gardaí have the power to photograph persons who are detained, but not those who are arrested and released and dealt with by way of summons. The expert group recommended that gardaí should be permitted to photograph every person who is arrested so as to have a reliable means of identification, not least for ensuring that the summons is served on the proper person.The expert group suggested that the same safeguards which apply to the photographing of detained persons could be applied to the proposed new power. Accordingly, section 11(3) provides that the provisions of section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 on the destruction of records shall apply to photographs, including negatives, taken pursuant to this section as they apply to photographs taken pursuant to section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984. Section 11(4) provides that a person who refuses to allow himself or herself to be photographed shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.I see many advantages in a member of the Garda Síochána being in a position to take a photograph of a suspect when investigating disorder. The ICT strategy for the Garda Síochána 2005-2010, identifies mobile data communications as an important aspect of its programme of work in the area of telecommunications. The strategy recommends solutions for the mobile data needs of the Garda Síochána, which will encompass a national digital radio service and mobile technologies such as GPRS and 3G. Such technologies could encompass photographic or video evidence and data. Its implementation and use will depend on a broad range of factors including the operational and business requirements of the force.

These documents have provided ethical principles and goals for advancing alcohol policy and a template of strategies for alcohol action. When drafting its reports, the strategic task force on alcohol framed its recommendations using the ten strategy areas outlined in the WHO European charter on alcohol. These reports provide approximately 100 recommendations and significant progress has been made in implementing them across a range of sectors.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	441	Under section 31 of the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive must submit a service plan to my Department within 21 days of the publication of the Estimates. The service plan was submitted in line with the legislation on 8 December 2005 and was approved by me on 22 December 2005.In addition under section 35 of the Health Act 2004 there is provision obliging the Health Service Executive to draw up a code of governance which will include guiding principles applicable to the executive as a public body. This code must include an outline the structure of the executive, including the roles and responsibilities of the board and the chief executive officer. In addition it must also outline the methods to be used to bring about the integration of health and personal social services.The Department has issued a framework document for corporate and financial governance for the Health Service Executive and requested the executive to draw up a code of governance, in line with the framework, to replace previous governance provisions in place in the old health board structures. The executive submitted an update on progress of its code of governance to me in December. The executive is still working on the contents of the code and my Department is in communication with it in this respect.Funding for the health services for the next year will be agreed in the context of the Estimates campaign which is due to commence presently. The process will conclude later this year with the publication of the Abridged Estimates Volume 2007.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	447	The Commissioners of Public Works received a request this week from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to acquire a premises for the Garda in Carndonagh, County Donegal. The matter is being pursued.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	448	A brief of requirements for the proposed new Garda station at Buncrana, County Donegal, was received from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 29 March 2006. An analysis is being undertaken to ascertain if the brief of requirements can be accommodated on the decentralisation site for the Department of Social and Family Affairs. This report will be completed by mid May 2006. The timescale for the construction of the new Garda station is dependent on this report. A temporary alternative location for Buncrana Garda station is being examined from a technical point of view. An assessment of this property will be completed shortly.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the pension payable to a former officer of the Civil Service is chargeable to tax in the State irrespective of where he or she resides, unless such pension is relieved from the charge to Irish tax under the terms of a double taxation agreement between the State and another country.Article 18(2) of the convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the State and the United Kingdom provides that any pension paid by, or out of funds created by, a contracting state in respect of services rendered to that State shall be taxable only in that State except where the individual is a resident of, and a national of, the other contracting state.Consequently, individuals living in the United Kingdom in receipt of a Civil Service pension from the State are taxable in Ireland on that pension unless they are nationals of the United Kingdom, in which case, they will pay tax there on that pension. The reason that double taxation agreements make no mention of health contributions, also known as the health levy, is that such contributions are not tax.The legal basis for the health contributions levy is contained in the Health Contributions Act 1979, as amended, and associated regulations. While the legislation is a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children in the first instance, generally speaking income which is subject to an income tax charge is also subject to the health contributions levy. This is subject to the following main exceptions which are set out in terms of categories of exempt persons. These include persons whose gross income does not exceed €440 per week; persons who are fully eligible for health services under section 45 Health Act 1970, such as holders of an medical card; persons in receipt of a widow or widower's contributory or non-contributory pension or occupational injuries pension payable under the Social Welfare Acts or a corresponding EU pension; persons in receipt of a deserted wife's benefit or allowance payable under the Social Welfare Acts; persons in receipt of a lone parents allowance payable under the Social Welfare Acts. There are no plans to alter the applicability of the health contributions levy.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that land leased in compliance with the terms of the schemes of early retirement from farming is a qualifying asset for capital gains tax retirement relief purposes provided it was owned and used for farming purposes by the individual claiming relief throughout the period of ten years immediately prior to it being first leased. Effectively the period of ownership and usage tests on land leased under these schemes are applied when the land is leased rather than when it is disposed. Where the farmer disposes of some or all of such land after he or she has finished in the scheme full relief from capital gains tax will apply where the individual is 55 years or more at the time of disposal and the consideration, inclusive of any earlier disposals of qualifying assets, does not exceed €500,000. Otherwise marginal relief may apply. Where the disposal is to a child or favoured nephew or niece of the individual the €500,000 threshold does not apply and full relief from capital gains tax is given.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I have had no discussions with Greencore plc., on the issue of utilising the Mallow plant to produce ethanol. The potential for using the existing facilities in Mallow for such purposes is ultimately a commercial decision for Greencore plc. The new biofuels excise relief programme, which is subject to State aid approval, will provide a framework in which potential developers can consider such options.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I have recently seen a copy of the submission issued to Members from the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland and the Irish Federation of Pike Angling Clubs on the conservation needs of coarse fish species, which I have noted and intend to consider carefully.I should point out, however, that under the Fisheries Acts, the fisheries boards are primarily responsible for the management, conservation, protection, development and improvement of inland fisheries including coarse fish stocks. I rely on the advice of the boards in determining policy and legislative measures aimed at protecting these stocks.The submission makes reference to the review of coarse fish policy being undertaken by the central fisheries board with a view to advising me on developing an informed national policy for the management, development and protection of this important natural resource. The group undertaking the review, whose terms of reference include, inter alia, the establishment of the current status of the coarse fishery resource and the need for protective legislation, expects to complete its work shortly and intends to forward its report to me, following due consideration by the fisheries boards. Any conservation or legislative measures recommended to me arising from the review will be considered without delay.In the meantime, the national fishery managers executive is considering appropriate fish conservation measures, including possible by-laws that might be put in place in the short term. I am awaiting its advice, which is due imminently. I will further consider the submission from the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland and the Irish Federation of Pike Angling Clubs in the context of the official advices I receive.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	453	As I explained to the House in reply to a question on 25 April 2006, I am aware of the difficulties facing the Baha'i community in Iran. The statement made on 20 March by the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, is the latest in a series of reports which raise serious concerns about the matter.The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains close contacts with the Baha'i community in Ireland about the situation of their coreligionists on the ground. In its contacts with the Iranian Embassy in Dublin the Department regularly conveys the Government's concerns.Ireland has also frequently raised the situation of the Baha'i in Iran at EU level and the EU's concerns about the treatment of the Baha'i have in turn been brought to the attention of the Iranian authorities on many occasions. Ireland and its EU partners have also supported resolutions on Iran at the UN General Assembly and at the UN Commission on Human Rights. These initiatives have brought specific attention to the plight of the Baha'i in Iran.The situation of the Baha'i community has also been raised during the formal EU-Iran human rights dialogues, the last session of which took place during the Irish term of the EU Presidency in 2004. Iran has been reluctant to agree dates for a renewed session of the human rights dialogue and the dialogue has been in abeyance since that time, though consultations on the next session are ongoing.The External Relations Council on 10 April 2006 issued conclusions on Iran which underlined the EUs continuing concern about human rights in Iran, in particular the treatment of the Baha'i and other religious minorities. In addition, the EU Presidency raised several human rights concerns directly with the Iranian Government on 11 April 2006, including the problems alluded to in the special rapporteur's statement. Ireland and the EU will remain actively engaged on this issue and will continue to raise it in all appropriate fora.

The programme is advertised on an annual basis.Applications for funding under the 2006 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 27 and 28 November 2005. The closing date for receipt of applications was Friday, 20 January 2006. All applications received before the deadline, including one from the organisation in question, are currently being evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	455	The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country. The programme is advertised on an annual basis.Applications for funding under the 2006 programme were invited through advertisements in the press on 27 and 28 November 2005. The closing date for receipt of applications was Friday, 20 January 2006. An application was received from the organisation in question before the closing date. However, I should point out to the Deputy that as the application to which he refers is toward the cost of musical instruments and has no sporting element, it is not eligible for funding under the sports capital programme.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	456	Nationals of countries outside the EEA wishing to work in Ireland require either a working visa or work authorisation or a work permit. Applications to work in Ireland under the working visa or work authorisation scheme are processed at Irish embassies and consulates abroad and application forms are available from same. The scheme requires that particular criteria be met and is administered through the Department of Foreign Affairs.The work permit section of my Department will consider granting an employer a work permit for highly skilled and highly paid positions within certain sectors. Details of the working visa or work authorisation and work permit schemes are available on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The person's application for carer's allowance was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that he is employed outside the home for more than ten hours per week. The person appealed this decision to the social welfare appeals office, which acts independently of my Department. In accordance with the statutory requirements the relevant departmental papers, including a submission from the deciding officer, were sought. The papers have been referred to the appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing in the case in due course.Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The application from the person to whom the Deputy refers was received on 23 March. The claim is being processed in my Department at present and I expect that it will be decided within the next week. If the claim is awarded, payment will issue within one week of the decision being made.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	459	In the case in question, a deciding officer determined that the person concerned lost his employment by reason of misconduct and, under the legislation, is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit for nine weeks to 10 May 2006. He was notified on 19 April 2006. It is open to him to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose was issued to him on 24 April 2006. A decision will be made shortly on his entitlement to benefit after the period of disqualification and he will be notified of the outcome.Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I have been informed by Dublin Bus that the average age of its bus fleet is 6.5 years and that 207 of its 1,082 buses entered service prior to 1997. Dublin Bus has purchased 895 new buses since 1997.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	461	Very significant progress has been made to date in transforming Ireland's major inter-urban network to motorway and high-quality dual carriageway standard. The National Roads Authority, NRA, which has statutory responsibility for the implementation of the national roads programme, has informed me that on the five major inter-urban routes, namely, Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and the Northern Ireland Border, 15 projects have been completed and opened since the commencement of the current national development plan.I am further informed that the total expenditure incurred on these projects was approximately €1.5 billion. In addition, projects currently under construction on the major inter-urban network have a value of approximately €1.1 billion with a further €500 million worth of projects about to have construction contracts signed. Private funding of close to €500 million has also been invested in these routes.I also understand from the NRA that all of the remaining schemes on the major inter-urban routes have now received the necessary statutory approvals to allow the projects to proceed to construction. This clears the way for these remaining schemes to proceed to the tender stage. The final cost of these schemes will only be known once the tender processes have been completed. In line with the objective set in Transport 21, the NRA is on target to complete all of the major inter-urban routes by 2010.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The correspondence in question refers to issues relating to the operation of small public service vehicles in Athlone. The investigation of complaints concerning non-compliance with the provisions of the public service vehicles regulations, which relate to the licensing, control and operation of small public service vehicles generally and the enforcement of those regulations are matters for the consideration of the Garda Síochána. Accordingly, the relevant correspondence was referred to the Garda for examination and any necessary follow-up action.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Earlier this week, I signed into effect regulations to implement EU Directive 2004/54/EC (Minimum Safety Requirements for Tunnels in the Trans-European Network). The regulations provide for levels of technical provision that must be attained in all tunnels falling within the ambit of the directive and the establishment of procedures and processes to govern the design, construction and operational phases of such tunnels. In Ireland, the Dublin Port tunnel and the Jack Lynch tunnel fall under the ambit of the directive.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The question as to whether the requirement for photographic evidence by certain aviation companies represents a restraint of trade is a matter that should be raised with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand that airlines' requirements in respect of the forms of identification acceptable to them are clearly set down in the terms and conditions provided to passengers when booking and purchasing tickets. Decisions by any airline regarding what they consider to be acceptable identification for their own purposes are matters entirely for those airlines and not matters in which I have any function. Passengers intending to travel on aircraft should pay particularly close attention to those requirements. With increasing airline security requirements passengers will be asked to present forms of identification at departure gates when seeking to board flights.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	467	As the Deputy is aware, the project in question was established as part of a series of pilot cocaine interventions. An evaluation of the project is currently being carried out and I expect this will be submitted to my Department in the near future.Notwithstanding the fact that it was established on a pilot basis, and that the evaluation of the project is not yet complete, I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that additional funding has been allocated to facilitate its continuation until the report on the evaluation is received and considered.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	468	On 24 March I introduced a revised farm waste management scheme in order to assist farmers in meeting the additional requirements arising from the nitrates directive. Under the revised scheme, grant-aid is extended to include, inter alia, the construction of earth-lined slurry-effluent stores. In conjunction with the launch of the revised scheme, my Department published minimum specifications for the construction of such stores.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	469	An important part of the reform of the CAP leading to the creation of the single payment scheme is the creation of an effective link between EU support for agriculture and measures aimed at protecting the environment and improving the countryside as well as achieving high standards in food safety and in animal health and welfare. Farmers receiving direct aid under the single payment scheme are required to observe various statutory management requirements, SMRs, on the environment, food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health. They must also maintain their land in good agricultural and environmental condition. This is known as cross-compliance.My Department, as the EU accredited paying agency, will have primary responsibility to ensure that the required level of cross-compliance inspections is carried out and for fixing any sanctions to be applied. At the same time the competent control authorities are responsible for ensuring compliance with the standards and requirements defined under the SMRs and good agricultural and environmental conditions. For example, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency have statutory responsibility for compliance with the requirements defined in the sewage sludge, nitrates and protection of ground-water directives. The existence of cross-compliance inspections under the single payment scheme does not preclude the competent control authorities from meeting their own obligations under the various SMRs. There is a requirement for cross-reporting between the competent control authorities and the paying agency.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	470	An application under the single payment scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2005. During the processing of the application, matters arose which required to be satisfactorily resolved before payment could issue. Correspondence relating to these matters issued to the person named with a view to resolving the matter, but a reply has not been received to date. An official from my Department has since been in direct contact with the person named, following which, the person named has agreed to furnish the required documentation. Immediately on receipt of this documentation, the application will be processed for payment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	471	Some 17,500 farmers submitted applications to the national reserve but when account is taken of the number of farmers who applied under two or more categories over 23,000 files have to be processed. Following the first tranche of allocations, 4,979 letters have issued to applicants who were successful in their application and 6502 letters have issued to unsuccessful applicants. Processing of applications is continuing and allocations will be made where appropriate over the coming weeks.Many of the cases remaining to be processed have applied under more than one category. The regulations provide that where an applicant is successful under more than one category he or she can only be given an allocation under the category that is most beneficial. In addition, some 3,500 of the remaining applicants to the national reserve have already benefited under other force majeure or new entrant measures during the reference period.

Category D caters for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.A formal letter setting out my Department's decision has issued to the person named and he has been notified that if he is dissatisfied with my Department's decision in regard to the national reserve he now has the opportunity to appeal this decision to the independent payment appeals committee. An appeals application form is available from any of my Department's offices or on the Department's website at www.agriculture.gov.ie.My Department has been contacted on behalf of the person named and has agreed to also have the application assessed under category A and category B. Category A caters for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May 2005 and who had leased out his or her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000-02.Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-02. Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and-or ewe quota or other investments. My Department has requested that documentary evidence supporting an application under category A and category B be provided. On receipt of this evidence my Department will consider eligibility under these categories.

The consignment in question originated in another member state and, as such, was not subject to any EU ban, though such importations are subject to spot checks.Consignments of this nature must comply with the requirements of a general authorisation issued under the European Communities (Diseases of Animals Acts, 1966 and 1979 Orders) (General Authorisations for Imports) Regulations 1985, the conditions attaching to which require that the hobby birds must come from a holding which has been registered by the competent authority in accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 92/65/EEC; come from a holding in which avian influenza has not been diagnosed in the 30 days preceding the dispatch; come from a holding and an area not subject to restrictions under Council Directive 92/66/EEC introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle disease; be accompanied by a declaration completed and signed by the owner of the hobby birds; and in the case of psittacidae, be accompanied by a certificate signed by an official veterinarian of the country of export.In addition to these requirements, all but one of which were met, advance notice is required to be given to my Department not less than 24 hours prior to the intended date of importation and, under animal disease control measures, an official notification of the consignment, TRACES, is dispatched from the district veterinary office of the country of origin to the district veterinary office of the country of destination.In this particular case the consignment was not accompanied by the owner's declaration and my Department was not given the advance notice of the importation by the importer, though the TRACES message was despatched by the competent authorities in the exporting country on 13 April.Limited anonymous information about the importation was received by my Department on Thursday, 13 April and this information was passed to my Department's office at Rosslare. Similar anonymous information was received by the Customs and Excise service and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In all three cases the information provided was insufficient to identify the consignment on importation and, contrary to subsequent newspaper reports, my Department's officials did not have "detailed knowledge" of the importation.It is the case that the absence of the owner's declaration and the failure to provide advance notice of the importation represented a breach of the requirements, a fact since acknowledged by the importer who has undertaken to provide such notice in respect of all future importations. Officials of my Department met the importer at his premises on 24 April 2006. All of the documentation associated with this particular consignment was in order. The official documentation, including the health certificate, signed by an official veterinarian in the member state, and the details provided in the official notification issued by the competent authority in the exporting member state, provided by the importer was consistent with the birds present on the importer's premises.There is no evidence to support suggestions that some birds in the consignment had died in transit or that any bird carcases were subsequently illegally disposed of. The importer has been the subject of previous inspections by my Department, as are other registered importers, and on all previous occasions his importations have been found to be legal and all importation requirements to have been complied with.In the context of avian influenza, my Department has introduced a robust range of precautionary measures and fully implements all EU controls, including those relating to the importation of exotic birds. It should be noted that imports of pet birds from within the EU represent a low risk to Ireland's health status; the avian flu virus is more prevalent in wild birds whose entry cannot be controlled.

This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions.The person named established 36.36 entitlements with a unit value of €192.69 per entitlement, and a total value of €7,532.34. The single payment scheme application form received on May 4, 2005 declared 33.97 forage hectares. Accordingly, a payment amounting to €6,349.31, €192.69 per hectare declared on the application form, issued on 1 December, 2005.Subsequently the unit value was increased to €207.16 per entitlement as a result of the transfer of the additional amount of €542.00, €14.47 unit value per entitlement for the 36.36 entitlements held by the applicant. A supplementary payment of €491.55 less a deduction of €14.75 for modulation based on the declared area of 33.97 hectares issued on March 27, 2006. If the applicant declares 36.36 eligible hectares in his 2006 single payment scheme application, he will be entitled to benefit from the full single payment if he adheres to the conditions of the scheme.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	479	The report referred to in the Deputy's question is entitled, All our Children — Child Impact Assessment for Irish Children of Migrant Parents, by the Children's Rights Alliance which was commissioned by CADIC — Coalition Against the Deportation of Irish Children. The report was furnished to my Department on 24 April 2006. The report will require examination but, on a preliminary basis, it can be said that, in essence, it calls for a child impact assessment — templates for which are provided in the report — to be carried out in respect of two sets of children: (i) those Irish citizen children, that is, born before 1 January 2005, whose parents failed to be granted leave to remain under the IBC(05) scheme which I introduced in January 2005. The report maintains that such children may face de facto deportation if their parents are deported arising from their failure under the scheme; and (ii) those Irish citizen children whose parents were granted leave to remain under the scheme but who cannot be reunited with their siblings currently residing in the parents’ country of origin because of the specific prohibition on family reunification under the IBC(05) scheme.The report sets out what it believes to be the various legal bases for such child impact assessments and cites the use of assessments — not specifically in the area of immigration control — in countries such as the UK, Belgium and Sweden.The report sets out a "rights based" model for Ireland in creating a child impact assessment for the Irish children of migrant parents facing deportation and for those seeking family reunification. The model calls for, inter alia, an economic examination of the country of destination of the child, taking account of its health and social services, unemployment rate, poverty levels and so on.It should be noted that the concept of a child impact assessment was first put forward by the Children's Rights Alliance and by CADIC in a period where there was the prospect of deportations of significant numbers of parents of Irish-born children. That period was in the interregnum between the L&O judgment of the Supreme Court in January 2003 which, in essence, stated that parents of Irish-born children could be deported, and the initiation of the IBC(05) scheme by me in January 2005 which allowed for the granting of leave to remain to such parents. That scheme followed from the citizenship referendum in 2004 and the passing by the Oireachtas of the Immigration and Citizenship Act 2004, the effect of which is that children born to non-nationals from 1 January 2005 no longer enjoy an automatic right to citizenship. Under the IBC(05) scheme, 16,693 non-nationals were granted leave to remain on the basis of their parentage of children born in Ireland before 1 January, 2005. The scheme was a generous response by the State to the situation of those non-national parents of children born before 1 January 2005. A specific condition of the scheme was that no rights to family reunification arose from it. Refusal decisions were given in 1,119 cases: a breakdown of the reasons for the refusal of these applications is shown in the table. The individual circumstances of those who were refused under the scheme will be considered prior to any decision being made resulting in deportations. It is not possible to say at this stage how many such deportation decisions will be made.In relation to the broad issues raised in the report it should first be stated that an Irish citizen child cannot be deported from the State. Nonetheless, in the Supreme Court judgment in the L&O case on 23 January 2003, it was held that parents of an Irish citizen child do not enjoy an entitlement to reside in the State. The judgment is complex but an important finding was that while an Irish child has a right to have the care and company of its parents, there is no absolute right for this to take place in Ireland; further, that the Government may determine to deport a family, notwithstanding the effective removal of the Irish-born child, without violating the child's rights. Moreover, the court held that it cannot be said as a matter of law that the parents of a minor can assert a choice to reside in the State on behalf of a minor, even if that could be said to be in the interests of the minor.I have stated in response to several Dáil questions that it is accepted that non-national parents and children who are subject to deportation will return to countries which have welfare and health services inferior to ours and that this is not, in itself, a basis for allowing persons to remain here.It must also be understood that, under the existing arrangements, before any deportation order can be made it must be preceded by a process where 11 factors under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, must be considered. Among these factors are the family and domestic circumstances of the persons concerned; the common good; and humanitarian considerations. In that process, the individual circumstances of the child are considered, even if such a consideration would not fall to be described as a child impact assessment as set out in the Children's Rights Alliance document.The report will be considered in detail taking into account the matters referred to above and a response will issue to the Children's Rights Alliance in due course.Reason for refusal*TotalContinuous residence not proven566No identity proven104Granted refugee status94Criminality78No role in upbringing of IBC71IBC born in 200548Not the parent38IBC & parent abroad34IBC abroad33Applicant abroad21Already had status12Withdrew8Statutory declaration not signed7Child not born in Ireland3Deceased applicants2Total1,119*Note that in some cases more that one reason for refusal was given.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702, all ranks, as at 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.I have been further informed that there are a total of 24 gardaí, all ranks, employed as public service vehicles inspectors in the Garda Síochána. There are no civilians employed as public service vehicles inspectors. Garda management states that public service vehicles inspectors carry out the following duties: the issuing of small public service vehicle licences; issuing of large public service vehicle licences; inspecting vehicles involved in serious and fatal accidents where detailed and technical examination is required; the inspection of all Garda vehicles; and the monitoring of all taxis, hackneys, buses etc.I wish to point out to the Deputy that significant progress has been made on the implementation of the civilianisation programme approved by Government in 2001. A total of 113 civilian finance officers have been appointed and are carrying out the district finance officer duties which were hitherto performed by gardaí. Moreover, the recent establishment of the Garda information service centre, GISC, in Castlebar, manned by civilian staff, and the pending transfer of civilian staff from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the Garda Síochána as civil servants of the State, are significant developments in the context of greater Garda civilianisation.The establishment of the GISC alone will, when fully operational, allow for the equivalent of up to 300 gardaí to be freed up for frontline outdoor policing duties on a daily basis. A further review of civilianisation possibilities in the Garda Síochána is now under way with a view to securing many more redeployments of desk-bound gardaí to frontline, operational duties over the next four years.I should also say that the timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007 by way of intakes to the Garda college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources.

The court held that random, non-discriminatory checks were permitted, but that if checks are to be random they should not be aimed against foreign registered cars only. The enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts by members of the Garda Síochána does not distinguish between Irish nationals and non-nationals.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the insurance of foreign registered vehicles in use in Ireland is covered by the green card system. This system was established in 1953 to facilitate free movement of vehicles across territorial borders and to ensure equal treatment for victims of collisions caused by foreign vehicles. The green card is an international motor insurance certificate. This document is recognised in all EU member states as evidence of insurance. The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland is the body with responsibility for the operation of the system in Ireland.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that translation facilities are available to the Garda Síochána should they be required.A new foreign language road safety campaign was recently launched by my colleague the Minister for Transport. The objective of the campaign is to provide safety information to various minority ethnic groups. It focuses on legal requirements and road safety advice when driving in Ireland. Leaflets have been printed in a number of different languages and distributed to Garda stations and workplaces where non-nationals are likely to work.

Those conditions are that the applicant must be of full age, or by way of exception, be a minor born in the State; be of good character; have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of the application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and have made, before a judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State.In the context of naturalisation certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the State, periods granted for the purposes of study and periods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996. The person referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State in October 1998 and claimed asylum. He subsequently withdrew that application and applied for permission to remain in the State based on parentage of an Irish-born child. Permission to remain on that basis was granted in November 1999.An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's question was received in the citizenship section of my Department on 7 January 2004. The person concerned had not been resident in the State for five years at the time he applied and did not satisfy the statutory requirement of having one year's continuous reckonable residence in the State immediately prior to applying for naturalisation. He did not have permission to remain in the State between December 2002 and November 2003.In September 2002, my officials were informed by the Garda that the person concerned was no longer living with his wife and his Irish-born child. Correspondence ensued with the individual and his legal advisers over the next number of months to clarify the situation. It was established that the person concerned was not residing in the same household as the child. Notwithstanding this, it was decided to renew his permission to remain in November 2003 following receipt of appropriate documentation confirming that he was discharging the role of parent to the child. Consequently, the person concerned did not have permission to remain in the State for the period December 2002 to October 2003, and this period does not, therefore, reckon for the purposes of naturalisation. As the person in question did not meet the statutory residency requirement at that time, his application was deemed ineligible and he was informed of this decision in writing in February 2006. It is open to him to submit a new application if and when he is in a position to meet the statutory requirements as set out above.

Final decisions on the successful projects were made by an independent selection committee comprising representatives from both governmental and non-governmental organisations. As indicated in the guidelines published with the call for proposals on 4 October 2005, decisions made by the selection committee are not subject to appeal. Amounts are allocated to the successful projects immediately following the decision of the committee. Applications for co-financing totalling €5 million in respect of 32 projects were received. However, as only around €3 million was available for distribution, it was inevitable that some projects would not be funded. In this context, the NASC project did not receive funds on this occasion. In line with current practice on ERF funding, the fact that an organisation had been co-financed by the European Refugee Fund in the past was not a guarantee of continued funding as each application was assessed in respect of the merits of all the other applications received.In considering the applications for funding, the committee had regard to the European Council decision of 2 December 2004 establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2005 to 2010 and the guidelines published with the call for proposals on 4 October 2005. Other criteria included the degree to which each proposal complemented overall national requirements, cost effectiveness, organisational capacity, and the sustainability and long-term benefits of each proposal.The selection committee had a non-voting chairperson, Mr. John Haskins of the Reception and Integration Agency and the nine members were as follows: Sr. Bríd Keenan, Vincentian Refugee Centre, St. Peter's Church, Phibsboro; Mr. Eamonn Martin, Sophia Housing Association; Ms Niamh O'Doherty, Comhairle; Mr. William O'Dwyer, diversity and equality law division, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Sr. Joan Roddy: Churches Asylum Network and Refugee Project; Mr. Gerard Roughneen: Reception and Integration Agency, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Ms Anne Marie Treacy, asylum policy division, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; Ms Jennifer Wallace, National Consultative Committee for Racism and Interculturalism; and Ms Emily Wiinblad, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

The RIA is not responsible for the provision of accommodation to refugees. Persons with refugee status have the same housing entitlements as Irish citizens and as such, do not fall within the remit of the RIA or any other agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the provision of designated accommodation. At the end March 2006, the RIA's accommodation portfolio comprised 63 accommodation units across 22 counties, accommodating approximately 4,900 persons and 92 different nationalities.Every asylum seeker accommodated by the RIA is provided with a copy of the Direct Provision Reception and Accommodation Centre Services, Rules and Procedures. This booklet is available in six languages, including English and includes information on services provided at centres, house rules, complaints procedures, child protection and fire safety. I am arranging for a copy of this booklet in English to be sent to the Deputy for his information.While the RIA and centre managers endeavour and succeed in the main to resolve issues arising at centres in an informal way, formal warnings are issued where required and appropriate action taken if these warnings are not heeded. The RIA is primarily concerned for the safety of all residents and staff at accommodation and reception centres. In particular, the protection of children is paramount. In that regard, violence and personal and racist abuse towards fellow residents, staff and, above all, children is unacceptable to the RIA and will be met with swift and decisive action in order to protect the safety of those affected. Where the actions of an individual are such that the safety of residents and or staff at any centre would be jeopardised by the placement of that person back in RIA accommodation, the RIA cannot agree to such a placement.It should be noted that incidents of such a serious nature as to lead to an asylum seeker being excluded from RIA accommodation are extremely rare. Nonetheless, it is necessary on occasions for the RIA to expel an individual from an accommodation centre. The circumstances in which this can occur are detailed in section 3.22 of the rules. The RIA will, as a matter of course, consider any request for the reinstatement of an individual so expelled. However, the RIA have a duty of care towards residents and staff of accommodation centres and, in order to be reinstated in a RIA accommodation centre, the individual concerned would have to entirely satisfy the RIA that they no longer posed a threat to the safety and welfare of residents and staff.The Deputy might also wish to note that the RIA has accommodated just under 42,000 asylum seekers since 2000 and the overwhelming majority of these residents have spent their time in RIA accommodation in a peaceful and satisfactory fashion. Residents are facilitated with additional on-site supports such as GP and public health nurse services, community welfare, pre-school facilities, play facilities and English language supports. Furthermore, local support groups play an active role with residents and greatly assist them during their time in direct provision accommodation and beyond.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, she was informed by a letter dated 17 November 2005 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement. I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I wish to advise the Deputy at the outset that the case of the person concerned falls under the terms of the Dublin II regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003. This regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of asylum shopping across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one State. At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one state will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of refugees in orbit, a situation which had obtained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, the Dublin Convention. Under the Dublin Convention and the Dublin II regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, can on the basis of the relevant criteria request another state to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that state.The person concerned made an asylum claim in Ireland on 29 March 2005. Following investigation, it was determined by the ORAC, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II regulation, that France was the appropriate state to process his application as he had already made an asylum claim there on 2 July 2004. The person concerned was offered an opportunity to appeal the determination of the ORAC to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which he duly did through his legal representative, the refugee legal service on 18 August 2005. The tribunal upheld the determination of the ORAC that the person concerned should have his asylum claim examined in France and he was formally notified of this decision by letter dated 7 November 2005. The person concerned was kept informed of developments throughout the course of his asylum application in Ireland and he was made aware as soon as it was possible to do so that his case came under the terms of the Dublin II regulation.France accepted responsibility for the case of the person concerned, with the consequence that a transfer order was signed in respect of him on 29 July 2005. This order issued to him on 2 August 2005, requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 8 August 2005. He failed to present as required and is now classified as having evaded his transfer. Consequently, he is now liable to arrest and detention. He should therefore present himself to the Garda Síochana without further delay so that travel arrangements can be made to effect his transfer to France.In accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II regulation, France and not Ireland is responsible for examining the asylum claim of the person concerned. As a result, it is not my intention to examine his asylum claim here nor is it my intention to grant the person concerned any period of leave to reside here. Given that the person concerned lodged his initial asylum claim in France, it is entirely appropriate that he be transferred to that State.

This includes the exchange of intelligence relating to the trafficking and distribution of drugs.The Garda Síochána has an excellent level of co-operation with police forces from other jurisdictions through formal agreements and informal police-to-police contact. A network of formal and informal contacts has been developed with EU and non-EU countries. In order to facilitate co-operation between law enforcement agencies in the investigation of criminal activity, the Garda Síochána has a number of liaison officers posted in EU member states. In addition, Ireland is a member of Europol and has access through its liaison officers based at Europol's headquarters in the Hague to police forces throughout the European Union. The Garda Síochána has sought and been successful in receiving EU funding to conduct conferences and seminars designed to enhance co-operation between law enforcement agencies throughout the European Union. Ireland has direct access to all Interpol national bureaux. Currently, more than 180 countries are members of Interpol.International co-operation is also achieved through investigations conducted by the Garda Síochána within the State at the request of foreign law enforcement agencies and by the Garda Síochána requesting the assistance of other law enforcement agencies in conducting investigations on behalf of the Irish State in other jurisdictions. These requests are governed by the relevant legislation concerning mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.A number of co-operation agreements are in place with Governments and police forces in other jurisdictions, including Hungary, the Russian Federation, Poland, Cyprus and Bulgaria. These cover a range of criminal justice matters, including co-operation in combating drug trafficking, money laundering, organised crime, trafficking in persons, terrorism and other serious crime. Negotiations are ongoing on proposals for agreements with other jurisdictions. In addition, the Garda Síochána has put in place memoranda of understanding between the money laundering investigation unit of the Garda Síochána and financial intelligence units in other jurisdictions. These pertain to co-operation in the exchange of financial intelligence on money laundering.

Other staff in ORAC also provide support functions in the asylum area including dealing with cases under the EU Dublin regulation determining the member state responsible for processing asylum applications, family reunification functions, information technology support, reception duties in the applications centre and presentation work before the refugee appeals tribunal. I am also advised that ORAC does not retain the more detailed information requested by the Deputy on recommendations issued by that office. Insofar as the refugee appeals tribunal, RAT, is concerned, there are 33 members dealing with appeals arising from negative recommendations of ORAC. These members are appointed on a part-time basis under the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.On the additional information requested by the Deputy regarding individual members of RAT, I am advised by the chairperson of the refugee appeals tribunal that as his organisation is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions under the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, it would be inappropriate for him to provide the requested information.

As stated in my latest reply to the Deputy on 6 April 2006, an application has been received from the person concerned requesting revocation of her deportation order based on her relationship with a man granted refugee status in the State and their parentage of a child born in Ireland on 10 June 2005. This application is still under consideration by officials in my Department. The Deputy can, however, be assured that the person concerned will be notified of the outcome of this application as soon as a decision has been reached.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the missing persons bureau of the Garda Síochána is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons. All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.At present, local Garda management take direct responsibility for missing person cases, and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary. All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system. When a person is reported missing, the local Garda superintendent takes direct responsibility for the investigation and will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, for example, the national bureau of criminal investigation or the technical bureau. The systems put in place by the Garda Síochaná to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with the best international police practice and Garda management is satisfied, and has assured me, that the systems and resources in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person.The Garda Síochána interacts fully and as appropriate with all of the media outlets — print, radio and TV — in highlighting cases involving missing persons. The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation. In addition, every Garda district has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality. The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda college, Templemore, and is also covered in in-service training.The establishment of a national missing persons unit has been suggested from time to time and the matter is kept under ongoing review by the Garda authorities. There are arguments for and against such a proposal. The view of the Garda Síochána, which has been gained through experience, is that while specialist units prove extremely useful in investigating certain types of crime, missing person cases, by their nature, require specific local knowledge both about the area where they occur and the circumstances and background of the person who is missing.Research regarding missing person investigations has previously been conducted by the police authorities in the United States of America. Garda authorities maintain close links with the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform functions as the central authority for Ireland in implementing the Hague and Luxembourg conventions which operate to secure the speedy return of an abducted child to its habitual residence, where the courts can decide how the child's best interest can be served.The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed. If their professional judgement is that some change in the existing legislation, protocols or structures would be of assistance in improving investigations, this would be considered by my Department.

Legal services are currently being provided to all eligible persons within a maximum period of four months nationwide and at half of the board's law centres the maximum waiting time at the end of January 2006 was two months or less. This progress has been achieved largely due to the allocation of a substantial increase in the board's funding.The board provides a priority service to persons seeking legal services for cases involving domestic violence, child care, child abduction and for certain other matters where there are statutory time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and without going on a waiting list.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	503	Our legislative provisions for the granting of bail are very stringent. The sixteenth amendment of the Constitution provides for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to the amendment and tightened up the bail regime generally. Furthermore, the Criminal Justice Act 1984 provides that any sentence of imprisonment passed on a person for an offence committed shall be consecutive on any sentence passed on him or her for a previous offence. The granting of bail in accordance with the Act, the amount of bail and sentencing are matters for the courts which are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.In relation to bail in general, I would point out to the Deputy that during the term of office of the rainbow coalition the number of prisoners on temporary release reached an all time high of 20% at one stage. As a result of the action of this Government this so called revolving door system operated by the rainbow coalition has been stopped and the percentage of the prison population on temporary release now is approximately 2.3%. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of headline offences, by group, committed by persons on bail for years 2004 and 2005 are set out in the following table.Group TypeOffences recorded in 2005*Offences recorded in 2004Group 01 — Homicide2320Group 02 — Assault242281Group 03 — Sexual Offences3626Group 04 — Arson2723Group 05 — Drugs433317Group 06 — Theft2,9522,842Group 07 — Burglary1,2451,172Group 08 — Robbery338305Group 09 — Fraud196224Group 10 — Other Headline Offences10892Totals5,6005,302*Figures for 2005 are provisional, operational and liable to change.I am further informed that 2004 was the first year information relating to the offences committed by persons on bail was published from the PULSE crime recording system. Comparable statistics for years prior to 2004 are not readily available and would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to extract the data from manual records.The statistics in the Commissioner's report classify offences committed while on bail under the ten headline crime groups under which the report's statistics are categorised. It is important to note that all offences in, for example, the homicide group are not the homicide offences of murder and manslaughter. The homicide group of headline offences also includes the offences of attempted murder, murder threats, infanticide, abortion and procuring or assisting in an abortion.I believe that these figures require further examination. I have therefore requested the Garda authorities to provide as a matter of urgency a detailed breakdown of the statistics given in the annual report and to provide additional information. Among the matters on which I have requested further information are data on the offences for which the offenders were on bail when they committed the subsequent offence and how many have been convicted of that subsequent offence. I expect to receive the information requested shortly, when it will be examined in my Department. Depending on the outcome of that examination, further research into the figures may be warranted with a view to seeing whether action is required.

Since its inception in 1996, the bureau has had many major successes in seizing the ill-gotten gains of criminals. The Criminal Assets Bureau takes actions under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 to seize property and assets which have been shown in the High Court to be the proceeds of crime. The Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2005 has enhanced the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in this regard.The following table gives a year by year breakdown of the total value of orders obtained by the bureau under section 3 of the 1996 Act from the inception of the bureau in 1996 to 2004, inclusive:YearAmount1996€2,600,4241997€1,899,7561998€1,385,8081999€1,033,1342000€2,083,9132001€1,705,196Stg £279,636US $224,9262002€2,504,669Stg £1,993,094US $5,247,8212003€71,699Stg £557,0702004€1,688,651Stg £375Total 1996 to 2004€14,973,250Stg £2,830,175US $5,472,747The figures in respect of orders obtained in 2005 are not yet available pending publication of the Bureau's Annual Report for last year.

That compares with a total strength of 10,702, covering all ranks, on 30 June 1997 and represents an increase of 1,737, or 16.2%, in the personnel strength of the force during that period.I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Garda Dublin metropolitan region consists of six operational divisions and the Dublin metropolitan traffic corps. The personnel strength of each of the Dublin metropolitan region divisions on 31 March 2006 was as follows.DivisionStrengthDMR South Central711DMR North Central648DMR South566DMR North611DMR West679DMR East563I am advised that the Garda Síochána operates a three-relief roster system whereby three out of four units work in any 24-hour period, with the fourth unit resting in the same 24-hour period.In addition, I understand that there are also 147 officers in the Dublin traffic unit and 99 officers in Dublin command and control. That brings the overall strength in the Dublin region to over 4,020 personnel. That does not include hundreds of officers in special units who operate extensively, but not exclusively in Dublin.For security and operational reasons, it is not Garda policy to disclose the number of personnel on patrol in any particular area over a specific period of time. Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible garda service is provided to the general public. On the question of Garda resources, it is also the case that the Garda budget for 2006 is at an all-time high of €1.29 billion.I should also say that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government is fully on target. That will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the first group of newly attested gardaí under the accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, and a further 275 newly attested gardaí will come on stream every 90 days henceforth. The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage those additional resources.

The capital allocation for IT in 2006 is €33.323 million. The allocation for communications is €12.9 million.At present, the procurement of a managed digital radio service is being undertaken by the Department of Finance on behalf of the Garda Síochána, other blue-light services and some non-commercial public bodies. An EU-based restricted tender procedure is currently under way, and the first stage of short-listing suppliers has been completed. It is planned that tender documents will be issued to those suppliers in the coming weeks. The implementation of the new service is planned to commence later this year.

The effect is twofold. First, when providing certain specified services, designated bodies and persons are obliged to identify customers and retain certain records. Second, designated bodies and persons must report to the Garda Síochána any suspicion that a money-laundering offence has been or is being committed regarding their business.The legislation further requires designated bodies to adopt measures to prevent and detect the commission of a money-laundering offence, including the establishment of internal procedures, circulation of instructions to, and appropriate training of employees, directors and officers.Ireland's anti-money-laundering legislation and other measures were evaluated recently by the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, the leading international anti-money-laundering organisation. The report of that evaluation contained several recommendations. The amendments to the criminal law which would be needed to implement the recommendations of the report are being assessed by officials of my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. That assessment is being conducted in parallel with the examination of legislative requirements to implement the third EU anti-money-laundering directive, which was agreed in late 2005. Any legislative proposals will be submitted to Government for approval in the normal way.All suspicious transaction reports, STRs, made to the money-laundering investigation unit of the Garda bureau of fraud investigation are investigated in full in an attempt to link the subject or funds to any form of criminal activity. A number of STR investigations are also referred to the Criminal Assets Bureau annually for further investigation.

Transport resources are allocated by Garda management in a way that best meets operational requirements and the maintenance of law and order. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the total number of vehicles in Garda divisions is 1,525 and that there are an additional 296 vehicles assigned to Garda headquarters. Furthermore, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that there is an adequate number of patrol cars and drivers available in each Garda division to meet requirements.I have informed the Garda Commissioner that additional funding will be made available to him if he wants to further increase the number of Garda vehicles.I am informed by the Garda authorities that members of the Garda Síochána are allowed to drive official vehicles in two circumstances, namely, where they hold at least a class B driving licence and have been authorised to drive by the Chief Superintendent, or they have completed an official driving course.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the ten offence groups used to show headline offences were first introduced in the Garda Síochána annual report of 2000 in conjunction with the introduction of the PULSE system. The changes to the classifications which have been made are set out below.Changes to reflect the introduction of new legislation were made in 2002. This included the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which required a minor change to group 6 — change of name to thefts — and a major change to group 9 — frauds. In group 9 the offences of embezzlement and false pretences were removed having been abolished. Three new offences, European Communities fraud, counterfeiting notes and coins and possession of an article — fraud — were included. In addition coinage offences were removed from group 10 and replaced by the new classification in group 9 of counterfeiting notes and coins.In 2003 a new crime classification, Criminal Assets Bureau offences, was added to group 9. In 2005 two new headline offences were added, Sex Offenders Act 2001 offences to group 3 — sexual offences — and employer permit offences to group 10 — other headline offences. All changes made to crime classification are identified in the Garda Síochána annual report of the appropriate year.

On resignation from her employment with the VEC, the pension contributions which she had paid were returned to her. The minimum period of service needed at that time to qualify for payment of pension, on attaining age 60, was ten years and to qualify for payment of a marriage gratuity, in the case of female employees, was five years. Provisions for the preservation of pension entitlements until age 60 by persons who resigned before that age were not introduced until 1977 and then applied only to employees in service on or after that date who had a minimum of five years' service.

The additional documentation requested has been received in my Department and is currently under examination. A decision on which school building projects will advance to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	514	Under the terms of the Department's maintenance grants schemes, and in accordance with the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1992, a mature student is defined as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.Under the terms of my Department's 2005 third level student maintenance grant schemes the position is that, generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. A mature student is defined for the purposes of the schemes as a candidate who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.Mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents or guardians. An independent mature student is defined as meaning a mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his-her parents or guardians from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' or guardians' income or address.When assessing the means of students other than independent mature students, the means test provision of the scheme specifies that the students' means and those of their parents or guardians must be below a prescribed limit. This provision requires that parental income be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances in any case where the student is not an independent mature student.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	515	All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, that is administered by NEPS and full details of which are available on my Department's website.Since the establishment of NEPS in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 122. The Public Appointments Service recently concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of educational psychologists to NEPS. Regional panels have been established to allow my Department assign greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need. My Department is currently in the process of recruiting a further nine psychologists.In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice to teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows psychologists to offer early appointments to children who are in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	516	My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of students attending approved post-leaving certificate courses in approved PLC centres: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.The candidate to whom the Deputy refers was attending a post-leaving certificate course in 2004-05. To qualify for the top-up grant all candidates must satisfy the following conditions: qualify for the ordinary maintenance grant in respect of the relevant academic year — 2004-05 in this case; total reckonable income in the tax year to 31 December 2003 must not exceed €14,693 — net of standard exclusions, as set out in the 2004 maintenance grants scheme, and net of CDA payments, where applicable; and as at 31 December 2003, the reckonable income of parent/s or guardian/s, the candidate himself or herself, or the income of the spouse or partner, as the case may be, must include one of the eligible social welfare payments prescribed under the scheme.Decisions on applications are taken by the awarding authority based on the conditions and terms issued by my Department. My Department has asked Kildare VEC, the awarding authority in this case, to re-examine the application submitted in respect of the 2004-05 academic year to determine whether the student was eligible for the top-up grant. The student will be notified of the outcome of the review.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The building project for the school in question is at an early stage of architectural planning. The project is currently at stage 2, the outline sketch scheme. The school was listed in my announcement of 2005 as a project to progress through architectural planning up to pre-tender stage, that is, up to and including advanced architectural planning, following the appointment of a full design team.The design and planning of a building project is covered by stages 1 to 5, during which the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability, through the detailed design, including the obtaining of planning permission, to the point where detailed bills of quantities are prepared. The project at Our Lady's Secondary School, Templeogue, will be allowed to progress to stage 5. This is the final stage before invitation of tenders. Progression of projects to construction will be considered in the context of the schools building and modernisation programme for 2006-10.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Children who have been assessed as having special educational needs have access to a range of special support services. The services range from special schools dedicated to particular disability groups, through special classes or units attached to ordinary schools, to placement on an integrated basis in ordinary schools, with special back-up supports.The allocation of resources for children with special educational needs is based on the criteria set out in my Department's circulars having regard to the recommendations of the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, 1993, also known as the SERC report.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through the local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing applications from primary and post-primary schools for special needs supports such as resource teaching hours and special needs assistant, SNA, support on the basis of applications in respect of individual pupils. The teaching and SNA support allocated are intended to enable schools to meet the needs of pupils as outlined in psychological and other professional reports.In allocating additional teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs examine the teaching and other resources available within the individual schools. The SENO also operates within the parameters of my Department's criteria for the allocation of such resources.Primary schools are also supported by means of a general allocation which provides additional teaching support to enable schools to cater for pupils with high incidence special educational needs, such as dyslexia, and those with low attainments. The system was constructed so that allocations would be based on certain pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.Second level schools continue to be supported by the allocation of additional teaching hours for each pupil enrolled who is assessed as having a special educational need. SNA support is allocated, as appropriate, to all schools where there are confirmed assessed care needs in respect of students.My Department's policy and approach in the area of special education is underpinned by statute, particularly the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, also known as the EPSEN Act, which was enacted in 2004.While many sections of the Act have already commenced, the remaining sections relate mainly to the statutory assessment, appeal and education plan processes. These cannot come into effect without the NCSE presenting an implementation report to my Department, which it is scheduled to do by October 2006.

The cost of transporting children with special educational needs, including grants, now accounts for about 33% of the overall allocation for school transport. This amounted to €41 million in 2005 and the estimated cost for 2006 will be €50 million.Bus Éireann endeavours to provide the best possible transport service for children with special needs. The size of vehicle required is determined by the number of special needs pupils requiring the service and the suitability of the vehicle to meet the requirements of the pupil. The Deputy will appreciate that it is not always possible to facilitate a child, by virtue of his or her special needs, on a regular school transport service. Furthermore, many children with special needs travel long distances from home to school and individual school transport, such as a taxi service, may be deemed to be the most suitable and appropriate mode of transport.My Department allocates funding to schools to enable them to employ escorts on school transport services. These escorts are specifically engaged by the schools to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support. These escorts are a valuable service for children with special needs who require assistance.The provision of a speech therapy service is a matter for the Health Service Executive. My Department has no responsibility to provide transport, the sole purpose of which is to enable children attend speech therapy sessions.

It is difficult to ascertain hard statistical information in this area, not least because of the use of subtle dissuasion rather than outright refusal. As I indicated, I will keep the issue under close scrutiny in the future.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	523	It has already been indicated that there will be a high degree of co-ordination in inspections and other requirements arising from the implementation of the regulations transposing the nitrates directive in order to alleviate to the greatest possible extent the burden on farmers from bringing the directive into operation.The necessary inspection and other functions assigned to local authorities and the EPA under the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2005 derive from the functions statutorily assigned to these agencies in environmental protection generally and, in particular, the protection of water quality. The regulations transpose the nitrates directive, which has the objective of reducing water pollution caused or induced by nitrates from agricultural sources and preventing further such pollution. Primary responsibility for the protection of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts and related legislation. In this context, high priority attaches to measures for the prevention of water pollution in addition to such measures as may be necessary to respond to pollution which has actually occurred.Local authorities operate under the general supervision of the EPA in the performance of all their functions in environmental protection. In addition, the EPA has direct licensing and inspection functions regarding intensive agricultural activities under the Environmental Protection Agency Acts. Farm inspections will also be carried out by the Department of Agriculture and Food in the context of cross-compliance under the single payment scheme.The regulations provide that local authorities shall aim to co-ordinate their inspection activities with those of other public authorities. A high degree of co-ordination of inspections is being developed between all the relevant authorities. Article 30 of the regulations provides for the drawing up of an inspection protocol for the purpose of promoting such co-ordination.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-04-27 00:00:00	Prelude	527	In March 2005, Sligo County Council submitted to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government a copy of a report prepared jointly by Sligo, Mayo and Roscommon county councils regarding the condition of the R294 between Ballina and Boyle. The report proposed a number of short-term and long-term improvement works to the route. The Department responded that it is open to the relevant councils to include the short-term restoration improvement works in their restoration programmes for 2006 onwards. It is also open to the councils to prioritise appropriate works on the route for funding under the EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme in 2006. In June and August 2005 respectively, local authorities were invited to submit proposals to the Department for inclusion in the 2006-08 restoration programme and the 2006 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme.Under the 2006 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme, Sligo County Council has been allocated a grant of €440,000 for realignment works at Mullaghroe on the R294. This is the only application for the R294 submitted to the Department by any of the three councils for consideration for funding under the scheme in 2006. Sligo County Council has included three schemes in its restoration improvement programme in respect of the R294 road, including works at Doobolla at a cost of €91,500, works at Drumartin at a cost of €101,000 and works at Gorterslin at a cost of €90,000. Mayo County Council has included works to the R294 at Abbey Street in Ballina at a cost of €459,082 under its restoration improvement programme. All the schemes will be funded from the Department's 2006 restoration improvement grants scheme. The Department will again seek applications under the EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme later this year. It will be open to Sligo, Mayo and Roscommon county councils to submit applications for consideration for further funding under this scheme in 2007. Further meetings on this matter are not planned at present.
