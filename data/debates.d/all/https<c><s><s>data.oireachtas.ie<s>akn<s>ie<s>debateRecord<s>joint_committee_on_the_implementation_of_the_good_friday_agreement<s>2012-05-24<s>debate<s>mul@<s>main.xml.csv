The first item on the agenda is a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Now that we have resumed, I wish to make a few comments on the Human Rights Consortium.  It represents a broad range of almost 200 non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and community groups from both communities in Northern Ireland and calls for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  A delegation of the committee met with members of the Human Rights Consortium in Derry in March to discuss community support within Northern Ireland for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  During that meeting members of the consortium said that there is currently 80% support across the communities for that bill of rights.  Today's meeting provides an opportunity to explore and debate the issue further.Also, the committee received correspondence this week from Mr. Peter Cheney, deputy editor of Agenda Northern Ireland magazine, in which he asks whether the committee, for balance, has any plans to hear the views of sceptics or opponents of a bill of rights.  He states that the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Traditional Unionist Voice, TUV, are either opposed or have become more sceptical over time about a bill of rights.  The committee will most likely consider separately the request to provide an opportunity to those opposing a bill of rights to appear before the committee.  It would be helpful, in the context of today’s meeting, if the consortium could perhaps comment on Mr. Cheney’s assertions.There are rules about privilege at the committee.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances at this committee but if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and if they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  Witnesses are directed that only comments or evidence relating to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside of the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Kevin Hanratty to make his presentation.  I understand Ms Fiona McCausland and Ms Helena Macormac wish to make brief introductory remarks.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Chairperson, Deputies, Senator, Members of Parliament, we are very grateful for the opportunity to present our evidence today.  I thank the Chairperson and members for their invitation to address this important committee.The Human Rights Consortium has been campaigning for a long time for a strong inclusive bill of rights.  We welcome all opinions on a bill of rights and believe the engagement of all opinions in that process is important in terms of producing a positive and shared outcome.  We welcome the committee's engagement with all viewpoints on a bill of rights.With the permission of the Chair, I will begin our presentation and Ms Fiona McCausland, our chairperson, and Ms Helena Macormac, a board member, will follow on from my short introduction.  We will give members a brief overview of the work of the Human Rights Consortium and some of the details around the process of developing a bill of rights for Northern Ireland, and outline some of the difficulties of that process.Let me put our work in context.  The Members of Parliament for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Belfast South, and Newry and Armagh will be very familiar with the peace agreement in Northern Ireland.  Like any peace agreement, it was tailored to address the specific local context and the circumstances we faced coming out of conflict  Some of these we now take for granted and others were given more lip service and never implemented properly.To recap, questions on constitutional status were addressed by means of changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution to allow for recognition of the principle of consent by the people of Northern Ireland and the granting of rights to them to identify themselves as British, Irish or both British and Irish.  Strand one established the democratic power-sharing arrangements in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Similarly, strands two and three established the North-South and east-west relationships.  Policing and criminal justice chapters dealt with wide-ranging reforms and reviews of both of those sectors.  Issues such as prison release, decommissioning and normalisation were among other issues that were addressed and provided for within the protections and proposed reforms of the Good Friday Agreement.  While some of these provisions have caused serious difficulties and have had longer implementation processes than originally planned, all these elements of the agreement more or less have been widely implemented.  Comparatively speaking, the aim of a strong bill of rights is relatively straightforward and, when compared with the difficulties faced by some of these other provisions in terms of decommissioning, devolution of policing and justice powers, a fairly simple process.The agreement was framed to address a variety of contentious disputed issues within the conflict, recognising the complex nature of the dispute and the fact that all areas of life in Northern Ireland were affected by the conflict and, similarly, providing a nuanced solution to all of those areas.  One element that is missing in my narrative of implementation but which was a central part of the core of the Good Friday Agreement is the section on rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity.  A full analysis of the implementation of that specific chapter would take longer than we have today, but given the remit of the consortium, I wish to focus on one specific key element of that chapter: a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.The inclusion of a bill of rights was further recognition by those involved in the negotiations of the point I have made, that the conflict affected all aspects of life in Northern Ireland, rights were abused in all communities and principles of equality were undermined.  We believe, just as many who endorsed the agreement originally back in 1998, that regardless of whether democratic institutions at Stormont and other provisions provided the basis for stability and peaceful and democratic politics, a bill of rights also formed a key element in these new arrangements.  A bill of rights designed to take account of the particular rights violated in Northern Ireland could do two very important things.  One, it could establish a rights framework to guide our new government and politicians in the work of shaping a new society, essentially ensuring every person in Northern Ireland had a common set of mutual rights regardless of religion, political opinion or background.  Two, it would ensure, if tailored to our local needs and implemented properly, the abuse of rights, which sparked and fuelled the conflict, would never be repeated again.  This specific set of rights, this level of protection has yet to be delivered, and that is 14 years after the Good Friday Agreement was reached.The Human Rights Consortium has been in existence for the past 12 years and has been campaigning for a bill of rights for the fulfilment of that specific promise in the Good Friday Agreement.  Starting originally in 2000 as an ad hoc group of civil society organisations trying to encourage submission to the original bill of rights consultation run by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, we evolved into a full-time campaigning organisation calling for what we describe as a strong, inclusive bill of rights.  Since 2006, with the aid of funding, we have been able to put our campaigning efforts on a full-time basis, with the recruitment of a core staff team.  Throughout those 12 years, the bill of rights campaign has attracted hundreds of groups and thousands of individuals.  With a current membership of 196 organisations, including trade unions, NGOs and community and voluntary groups from all sectors of the community and geographic areas in Northern Ireland, we represent hundred of thousands of individuals.  Each group believes a strong and inclusive bill of rights can play a fundamental role in the creation of a more just, inclusive and shared Northern Ireland.  This remains one of the key undelivered elements of the agreement.  We request the support of this committee to help to change that.I thank members for their time.  My colleague, Ms Fiona McCausland, will continue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I work for the Northern Ireland Anti-Poverty Network and I am chairperson of the Human Rights Consortium.  Before I started to work with the Anti-Poverty Network, I was a development worker in the loyalist working class areas in Lisburn.To simplify the process to date, it is a good news story in terms of the unprecedented levels of cross-community campaigning.  We have had the failed expectations to deliver at a political level.  It is a very complicated discussion.Following the Good Friday Agreement there has been a series of consultations, discussions and engagements, focused on developing an agreed picture of what should be contained in our bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  It has not been an easy task and these engagements have involved consultations by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and have involved a wide range of community groups and civic society throughout Northern Ireland.  The initial consultation was in 2002 and the last consultation was in 2010, so it has been in the making for quite a considerable period.The Bill of Rights Forum, which sat between December 2006 and March 2008, was probably the main core of that discussion.  The process involved spending a lot of time listening to positions from civic society and political parties, but we did not get around to the actual process of negotiations.  The document we had at the end of the process was very extensive and comprehensive and basically set out the positions of the different and diverse parties, but we only had two to three days to negotiate and that was too little, too late.  That is not to dismiss the very positive engagement that took place between political parties and civic societies.  This gave us an understanding of the issues and the barriers to moving the process forward.  The relationships established at that time have developed.  In the absence of both a deadline with some pressure and of a willingness among members to compromise and negotiate, however, a process that was managed and designed to facilitate all of the above was doomed without that space to negotiate fully.  As Mr. Hanratty indicated, the concept of a bill of rights was included in the Good Friday Agreement because of the past abuses of rights.  As an anti-poverty campaigner who comes from a working class area, I know that the interface between poverty and conflict has been well documented.  As Dr. Mary Robinson said, poverty is an abuse of human rights.  It is no surprise that the areas that were most economically deprived in the 1960s and 1970s saw the highest numbers of deaths during the conflict.  These areas are still suffering the most.  Northern Ireland holds the title of having the highest level of post-conflict traumatic stress disorder in the world.  I suggest this is partially due to wealth inequality.  People find it difficult to address these issues because of the level of poverty in these areas.  That is why we have retained social and economic rights within our request for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  It was understood to form part of the settlement.  That is another reason this concept needs to be taken forward.Some of our politicians do not like social and economic rights.  However, such rights must take a prominent position in any solution that seeks to ensure we never return to the mistakes of the past.  If the abuse of social and economic rights was part of our problem, the protection of these rights must form part of the solution.  It is no coincidence that the areas which suffered deprivation in the past are now providing ground for recruitment within mainstream loyalism and dissident republicanism.  A bill of rights should be a key part of addressing these issues and making sure everybody feels included in the new Northern Ireland.  It should involve a human rights-based approach.  The principles of equality legislation should be used to move things forward.Our position on a bill of rights has not been plucked out of thin air.  It has been tried, tested and endorsed by our membership and the public at large.  The message that has emerged from polling and consultation is clear.  People want a strong and inclusive bill of rights that contains social and economic rights which could make a difference to their lives.  More than 80% of the people of Northern Ireland want a specific bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  Over 90% want rights to education, housing, health and adequate standards of living to be included.  When the last UK Government consulted people on this issue in 2010, some 34,000 members of the public in Northern Ireland clearly told the Northern Ireland Office that they wanted these protections to be set out in a bill of rights.  That is an unprecedented level of public solidarity in any Northern Ireland consultations.I thank the committee for its time.  My colleague, Ms Macormac, will now address it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I work for the Northern Ireland Council for Ethnic Minorities, NICEM.  I will finish our presentation by outlining briefly the current position on the progression of a bill of rights.  According to the Northern Ireland Office, its lack of further movement on the development of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland can be blamed on two things - the lack of consensus on the way forward among local political parties in Northern Ireland and the desire to await the outcome of the UK bill of rights process.I will speak, first, about the lack of political consensus.  The most recent intervention in the debate by the Northern Ireland Office was in 2011 when it wrote to all five main political parties to seek suggestions on ways to make progress with a bill of rights.  Consensus among the political parties in Northern Ireland will not emerge on foot of letters from the Secretary of State.  At least two of the five main political parties are opposed to taking a Northern Ireland bill of rights forward.  They have failed to show the leadership required to implement this outstanding element of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is clear that the Northern Ireland Office needs to sponsor an engagement or discussion among local political parties on a bill of rights.The UK bill of rights process is fundamentally different from that in Northern Ireland.  It has different origins, a different rationale and a different process.  It is clear that it will develop a very different set of outcomes that will not meet the most basic parameters of the debate on a bill of rights in Northern Ireland.  The British bill of rights debate originated before the 2010 Westminster elections, when David Cameron and Gordon Brown were competing about who could be the first person to write a UK constitution.  The establishment of the UK commission on a bill of rights following the elections was an attempt by the parties in the coalition Government there to do something, despite their opposing views on the future status of the UK Human Rights Act.  Given their frustration with its implementation, it is obvious that the Conservatives are interested in removing or undermining the Act.  The Liberal Democrats are determined to defend it.The current UK process is an attempt to delay the obvious conclusion that the two parties' positions on the issue are not compatible.  If we put faith in the UK process as a means of breaking the Northern Ireland bill of rights impasse, we will fail to take account of the specific nature of the Northern Ireland bill of rights debate.  Provision for a bill of rights was included as part of a peace settlement in a deeply divided society in order to provide confidence and security for everyone in that society that their rights were being protected.  The conversation with the communities in that society has continued in the last 12 years, as opposed to two or three years in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Specific and coherent views on what they would like to see in a bill of rights have emerged from those within these communities.  They have said they would like to see a focus on socioeconomic rights.  The Tories seem determined to rule out a similar focus within a UK bill of rights.It is clear that progress will most easily be made if a process that brings all political parties to the table is sponsored by the British Government.  As Ms McCausland pointed out, previous attempts at dialogue of this nature have been flawed.  The question of how best to put pressure on political parties to compromise has not been answered.  It is much easier to design a process to facilitate such dialogue, encourage the exploration of various models for Bill of Rights and examine the levels of enforceability possible.  The British Government needs to bring parties to the table for substantive engagement, rather than a mere repetition of tried and tested arguments.  Unionist anxieties about a strong bill of rights need to be removed.  Public demands for social and economic rights need to be addressed.  A serious process of discussion can achieve this.  Most importantly, it is essential to remember that we can design our local bill of rights to suit our particular circumstances and situations.  Like our peace agreement, our bill of rights must be tailored to suit local circumstances and difficulties.Civil society maintains that there is a need for a strong and inclusive bill of rights that includes the protection of international human rights standards.  We will judge the outcome of any dialogue on that basis.  It is clear that anxieties about the enforcement of social and economic rights and the desire to have a meaningful bill of rights that would benefit those who are most vulnerable are not mutually exclusive positions that cannot find common ground.  A process that leaves all options regarding the content of a bill of rights open and does not seek to impose solutions, but instead facilitates compromise and agreed positions on all sides is an achievable goal that needs to be brought forward urgently.The Good Friday Agreement held out the promise of a new, peaceful and stable Northern Ireland.  The preparation of a bill of rights was supposed to be a key element in ensuring peace and providing that stability.  This missing element continues to be much needed.  We ask the committee to help us by supporting in any way possible our efforts to bring this process to completion.I thank members of the committee for their patience in listening to what we have had to say.  Ms McCausland, Mr. Hanratty and I will be happy to try to answer questions they might have.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank the delegates for their presentation.  With the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and others, they have done a great deal of hard work over many years.  I would like to ask a question about Ms Macormac's final statement.  I accept that it is useful to share information at forums such as this, as it helps to raise the profile of the issue and include people in the process.  How does she think the issue can be moved forward?  Some of us have pushed this agenda strongly in any way we can.  However, there is resistance to our work.  We can continue to shout and argue the case.  It might be useful for people sitting around the table to consider how this committee, collectively or individually, may be able to help move the case forward.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I also welcome Dr. McDonnell and thank him for his submission.  I have just a few questions.  Is there a timescale for the proposed UK bill of rights?  Will it be implemented in some months or years?  Will the witnesses also elaborate on the work of the political parties in Northern Ireland on this?  Have they met together to discuss how to implement the bill of rights or not?  The witnesses have asked us to put pressure on the British Government.  As Dr. McDonnell said, we can talk and shout, but is there anything more constructive we can do to try to push the bill of rights needed in Northern Ireland?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I too welcome Dr. McDonnell.  To follow on from some of the previous questions, like others I share the frustration at the inability to bring this matter to a successful conclusion.  The proposition of bringing parties around the table again is fine and I have no objection to exploring that.  The difficulty is that if there is not an imperative for some parties to agree, they may be willing to sit it out for however long it takes and not reach agreement.  One of the difficulties is that the British Government approach has allowed parties have a veto in terms of setting up a bill of rights, whereas no such veto existed in the Good Friday Agreement.I accept the point that this is not linked to the British bill of rights and it should not be, although I think it does have an impact.  I remember meetings with previous Secretaries of State, one of whom was John Reid, who were quite cool towards the idea of a bill of rights because of the implications it would have in terms of a bill of rights debate in Britain.  I see that as a difficulty and I think the British Government has been allowing this to be dead-handed by Unionist opposition, even though polling shows a broad support for the idea of a bill of rights across all communities.  The question is - How do we crack this?  There is a reluctance on the part of the British Government to press the issue.  There is no veto in the Good Friday Agreement to the establishment of a bill of rights, so how do we move beyond constructive dialogue to getting a product from that dialogue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	9	With regard to how to move it forward, many people have asked whether we have spent long enough at this and whether it is time to say it is not going to happen and to put our time into something more productive.  We have worked a long time on it, but it has also taken a long time to get the Good Friday Agreement implemented.  We voted on the Good Friday Agreement as a whole and we expected it to be fully implemented.  It is implicit within the agreement that this part is needed to tie up the issues, such as looking at the causes of the conflict in terms of inequalities and human rights abuses, or even perceived human rights abuses.  This was key in the agreement and that is the reason it was mentioned so many times in it.  Therefore, to give up now is not an option for us.  The agreement must be fully implemented or else we risk going back into that cyclical violence that is experienced in other areas emerging from conflict.On how we can move it forward, as with any of the other areas that have moved forward, it must be placed as a central issue in the agenda of government.  It is part of an international agreement signed by the United Kingdom and Ireland and that is where the power must remain.  Policing and justice was, potentially, a more contentious issue and despite protestations from at least half of the parties that this would not happen, it did happen, because there was the political will on every side to see that part of the agreement implemented.  We believe it is now our turn and that is why we are asking the committee to look at the final bits of the agreement that have not been implemented.  This is what we signed up to.  Mr. Hanratty may want to add to that shortly.I will move on to the UK Bill of rights, which is a newer process.  Our consultation started in 2002 so the process has been much longer, but the fact it has been used to hold up the implementation of the British bill of rights is not acceptable to 50% of the population.  The British bill of rights has a totally different genesis from the concept of the Northern Ireland Bill of rights and that is the reason we have been trying to separate it.  The British bill of rights has been a red herring and has made it difficult, but we have made very strong representations that the process must be kept separate.  This is supported in Wales and Scotland.  The British bill has been put on hold and in the view of Rebecca Brooks has been shelved, as she reported last week.  That is all the information we have.  Without the support of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland constituencies, it seems it is felt that the UK Bill of rights is stagnated and cannot move forward.  However, I have noted that some of the DUP Members of Westminster have used that to delay looking at the Northern Ireland bill of rights.  That is a difficulty, but it is a red herring.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	10	To add to  that, very clearly there are issues with regard to the bill of rights from the position of Unionist political party representatives.  First, they have concerns with regard to social and economic rights around the enforceability of those rights and how that sits in a parliamentary democracy in terms of the relationship that is established between courts, elected representatives and citizens.  These are well rehearsed arguments and concerns, but I believe they are concerns that can be overcome.  As I mentioned previously, our peace process - the Good Friday Agreement - was specifically tailored to suit our circumstances.  We can very specifically design our bill of rights to do the same, to overcome those concerns and fears and to fit within our structures in terms of the judicial and Assembly process and to overcome the concerns of our politicians.The difficulty is that we have never come to a position where we have got down to solid negotiation.  The bill of rights form process was an opportunity to do that, but it was a failed opportunity.  It spent 15 months stating and discussing positions, but never got down to compromise.  Mr. Conor Murphy's question about how we can inject that compromise and move beyond initial positions is valid.  We believe the first step is an actual process and that is what is lacking currently.  There should not be a veto on any part of the Good Friday Agreement.  I noted recently that Senator George Mitchell gave evidence to the committee and some parts of his evidence were very important.  He talked about the frustrations and the process we went through to get the Good Friday Agreement, but he said that he was aware of even greater difficulty around implementation.  This issue is one of the long outstanding difficulties we have in terms of the agreement and is one of the final pieces of the jigsaw in terms of fulfilling the promise that was made in the agreement.In terms of the difficulties that Unionist political parties have, Senator Mitchell spoke about the bill of rights in the United States and how it plays a key part in protecting citizens from Government.  However, he also said that was only one side of the coin of liberty.  He said the other part was about how economics focuses on addressing poverty and deprivation.  We have spent the past 12 years in Northern Ireland discussing a bill of rights, how our coin of liberty and rights can be shaped to mould a bill of rights that addresses both sides of the coin.  That is the reason, particularly for civic society groups, there is a focus on social and economic rights.  It may be a difficult question to address, but it is very important and was clearly put in the Good Friday Agreement for a good reason.

It is very frustrating to see this issue outstanding after 14 years, and I commend the members of the delegation on their perseverance and their determination to see it come to fruition.  I fully concur that social deprivation, poverty and inequality affect every community across this island.  The necessity for a bill of rights to address the social and economic problems on the ground is an essential struggle for all us.  The problem is to try to make it a political issue that legislators, in particular, cannot walk away from and must address.The witnesses stated in their presentation that polling they have carried out shows overwhelming support for a bill of rights, particularly in affected communities.  Can they see a role for public pressure to be put on elected representatives and by extension, the British Government, to help bring about a bill of rights that would be shaped to the needs and requirements of our communities and our people?  If the political will existed at British Government level, it would happen.  What are the views of the delegation on that?  From their experience, is there a difference between the Labour Party and the Tories on the issue?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I join in the welcome for the delegation today.  It is always good to get an honest perspective.  Today we are looking at how to move this forward, but it is also important to outline where we are at right now.  If we look around this room, we can observe that we are lacking representation from the Unionist community.  That has been the case since the formation of this committee.  It is always important to point that out.  They are still welcome to come here, and if there are fears about titles and language, we should look at the possible amendment of the Good Friday Agreement to call it the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement.  That invite is still open.  If we are to move this process forward, we need them here.  This is an implementation committee, and if we are implementing aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, we need everybody around the table.It is good to have the delegation here, because it keeps reminding us that while 1998 is a long time ago, much has changed and there has been a lot of good, but there remains much to do.  We have our own challenge at the political level to implement another aspect of the Good Friday Agreement, which is the North-South parliamentary forum.  We have been making good progress in the forum.  There has been much dialogue and negotiation, and this has happened because we had everybody present.  I would like to acknowledge all the work done by the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr. Willie Hay, our own Ceann Comhairle and his predecessors in trying to bring that process forward.The parliamentary forum will be integral to helping this committee do what it is trying to do.  Mr. Hanratty pointed out that the final piece of the jigsaw is the bill of rights.  Ms McCausland mentioned the red herrings and the Scottish stuff.  That is completely out of our control, but we should look at what we can control and I would ask all parties in the North to look at re-engaging on the North-South parliamentary forum, because I think that is a process within which we can pursue many of the worthy objectives towards which the delegation is aspiring.

I would like to elaborate on Mr. Hanratty's point about the Unionist issues with the bill of rights and the socioeconomic issues that are causing them difficulty.  Which issues specifically are causing them difficulty?  Is it an ideological thing?  Are they afraid that this is creeping socialism and that the delegation is trying to enshrine socialist principles in legislation, or is it just related to a couple of issues in respect of the bill of rights?

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.Time has a way of standing still sometimes, and before I was born, my family were campaigning for housing rights in Tyrone.  The housing executive was set up after that, but this morning on the radio we hear that there are still housing issues which are more about territory than about the right to a roof over one's head.  We therefore see very clearly the need to have a bill of rights enshrined, as there are still abuses of rights taking place.  It is obvious that the Unionist parties are by and large trying to stall any progress.This committee needs to do what we can to show our muscle and to do what we can to hold the British and Irish Governments to account to implement this aspect.  I know we will be talking about another aspect of that later today, but implementation is not happening in this area and it is a major outstanding issue that needs to be dealt with as quickly as possible.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	17	As an elected representative, I can see that there are issues in respect of having socioeconomic rights and a bill of rights.  One might be concerned that it would step into the legislative role and the democratic process.  People might vote for a right wing party because they agree with their point of view that housing should be provided privately and so on, whereas a left wing party might have a more state interventionist point of view on the issue.  Therefore I can sympathise with that view.Is there a way of bringing some of the sceptics on board for issues that they might agree with on principle?  Can we bring the sceptics into the negotiations in order to find out what it is they are sceptical about, and how broad the rights might be?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I will answer the questions about social and economic questions first, if that is useful.  There are concerns from Unionist political parties from an ideological point of view, due to the conservative political and ideological background of the UUP and the DUP.  I do not like to speak on their behalf, but historically some of the opposition to social and economic rights has been based on their concerns about the intervention of such rights, and whether that would undermine the role of an elected representative in allocating what they would say are the finite resources that an assembly or executive has to implement.  We understand those concerns.  They are well rehearsed internationally when it comes to the implementation of social and economic rights.  However, it is important to remember that elected representatives would be the first people responsible for implementing any bill of rights with social and economic rights at its core.  It would be their duty to decide how these rights were implemented.  It would not be a stick with which to beat politicians.  In fact, it would be a guide or blueprint for good governance in terms of the basic standards that, as a divided society, we want to recognise for all sections of the community.There is a long-standing jurisprudence on social and economic rights whereby they are realised in a different way.  They are progressively realised, so if a person wanted to earn a right to housing and adequate living, the person could not have turned up at a politician's constituency office and demand such rights overnight.  They have to be progressively realised over time.  Governments set benchmarks and indicators for how those rights are realised, and if they fail to move towards the progression of those rights, they can then be held to account.  Other relationships must be established in terms of individuals taking petitions to courts as well, but there are means and methods of addressing concerns about that.  For example, the Human Rights Act in the UK and the European Court of Human Rights operate what they call a margin of appreciation, which gives the latitude to elected representatives to allocate resources to take decisions within their remit in a way that does not allow for interference of the courts.  The courts accept that the people who are well briefed on these issues and most up to speed on how resources should be allocated are the elected representatives from these communities.  In terms of entering the debate and moving it forward, these are the arguments and discussions we need to have.  I totally accept that sceptical parties need to be around the table.  We want them to be there negotiating exactly this type of detail, looking at models of implementation and enforceability, and considering how we can maintain international human rights standards - standards, for example, within the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as other international covenants.  How can we maintain these standards while considering implementation, levels of enforceability and how these fit within a Northern Ireland context?  These are not two opposing positions that cannot meet somewhere in the middle.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Dialogue is welcome, particularly with elected representatives who have the responsibility to take forward implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  A number of members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Assembly have already engaged in trying to raise the concept and engage in discussions on a bill of rights.  We would welcome any help this committee or its members who sit in those various forums could offer in bringing that debate forward.It may come across from my presentation that engagement among Unionist politicians by people who are sceptical about a bill of rights, or some of the rights we want to include in such a Bill, has been completely negative.  It has not.  For example, the conversations we had in the bill of rights forum between December 2006 and March 2008 were very positive.  The engagement and contact and the general discussion about rights and education, not just in the civic society sector but also among elected politicians, were very positive.  It is just that the process failed when it got to the final hurdle in negotiating on a common position.  The answer to the question is that we would welcome engagement that would move the process forward in any manner.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The delegates have covered all of the questions asked.  Are there concluding remarks?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	22	As our polling results show, there is a mandate from civil society in terms of a desire for this; it is just that the demand is not necessarily showing among politicians in terms of political engagement to date.  To reiterate what my colleagues said, whatever the committee can do to move the debate forward with our politicians would be welcome.

It is being kept on the agenda and we will obviously contribute to it as a committee.  I thank the delegates who have given us good information.  We will make sure it informs our deliberations on this matter in the next few months.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	24	We will now have a discussion on the work of safefood Ireland as part of our consideration of the work of North-South bodies.  I welcome Mr. Martin Higgins, chief executive officer, Ms Lynn Ní Bhaoighealláin, chairman, and Mr. Ray Dolan, corporate services director of safefood.  The Food Safety Promotion Board is one of six North-South Implementation Bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement.  It implements policies agreed in the North-South Ministerial Council on an all-island and cross-Border basis.  It is principally charged with raising public awareness of food safety issues and related health issues such as obesity.  It also supports North-South scientific co-operation and links between institutions working in the field of food safety such as laboratories.Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances, but if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are thereafter protected only by qualified privilege.  Only comments or evidence related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given, and witnesses are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	25	We are delighted to have the opportunity to make a presentation to the committee.  As the Chairman said, safefood is one of the six implementation bodies set up under the Good Friday Agreement.  Departmental responsibility for safefood rests with the two health Departments, the Department of Health and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  Our headquarters are in Little Island in Cork and we have a sub-office in Dublin.  We have an indicative budget of €8.5 million for 2012 which equates to £6.8 million.  The Department of Health in Dublin provides 70% of the funding, with 30% coming from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  We have a permanent staffing level of 30.safefood has no function in the regulatory aspects of food; that is left to the bodies in the two jurisdictions.  Instead, we have a broad promotional role.  Our key function is to promote food safety as a responsibility shared by the entire food chain - everybody from primary producers to consumers.  The organisation is also charged with providing advice on nutrition.  However, our promotion role goes beyond promoting just to the public.  We promote, commission and fund research and we are responsible for ensuring protocols are in place to communicate food alerts, to advance the knowledge and surveillance of food-borne disease on the island and to promote scientific co-operation and laboratory linkages.  We have a specific function for developing an all-island strategy for specialised laboratory services and a general remit to provide an independent science-based assessment of the food supply.The governing legislation provides that the chief executive shall carry out the functions of the body under the direction of the NSMC, North-South Ministerial Council, and I am assisted in this duty by a 12-member advisory board of which Ms Lynn Ní Bhaoighealláin is the chairperson and a scientific advisory committee of 13 members.We operate under four directorates, two scientific directorates, one of which deals with food science and the other with human health and nutrition; marketing and communications because communications is a key aspect of our role; corporate operations which supports the operational structure of the organisation.The food environment continues to evolve, particularly as economic circumstances change.  There is an increasing recognition of the need to assist those who are prevented from making healthy choices as a result of low income.  The incidence of food-borne disease continues and its impact represents a significant economic cost.  Obesity is a significant public health challenge with two out of three adults on the island being overweight or obese, despite public campaigns to educate consumers over the years and additional efforts by industry to provide healthier options through a reduction in fat and salt levels.This leads to a significantly increased risk of stroke, diabetes and heart disease and results in considerable health costs.  It is estimated that up to 2,000 individuals die prematurely every year on the island as a result of weight-related conditions. One in four children starting school is overweight and the average 14-year old boy is three stone heavier than his grandfather at the same age.  In addition to these factors, there have been significant changes in the world of communications.  Traditional methods of communication such as television and radio advertising are losing ground as consumers take charge by choosing what they wish to view and how they view it.  There is no longer a static audience.  New media opportunities are constantly emerging, such as Twitter, Facebook, discussion boards and so on.Our strategy has been to empower individuals to make healthy and safe food choices by delivering messages that move consumers towards improved personal food safety and healthy eating and to disseminate knowledge and information in a way that is relevant, practical and fit for purpose.  This is supported by robust research.  We aim to influence the food environment, to provide support for consumers who are ready to modify their behaviour through workplace initiatives, community food initiatives, interface with industry and so on.  We aim to deliver a programme to stakeholders to maximise understanding and engagement.  We seek to support communities, including socially and economically disadvantaged communities, to help them achieve better health outcomes and to fulfil our remit in the context of value for money which is a key component of all our activities.  Details of some of these activities have been circulated to members.The health departments on both sides have advised us that Ministers have now agreed that full and final consideration of our 2012 business plan awaits the completion of separate reviews which are taking place in the two jurisdictions.  The Northern Ireland review is due to be completed by the end of June and we are advised that the review in this jurisdiction is due to be completed soon afterwards.This concludes my presentation and I am happy to deal with any questions from members.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I advise members that there is a vote in the House but I will remain and members may ask questions when they return.  The first question is from Ms Michelle Gildernew.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the delegation.  This is an issue I asked to be put on the agenda of this committee a few months ago because of my fears as then Chair of the health committee about what seemed to be a dilution of the areas of work in which safefood is involved.  It is a North-South body and its remit has been agreed in legislation so therefore it is accountable to the North-South Ministerial Council and not to the sponsoring Departments.  The St. Andrews Agreement contained an agreement for a review period and this review looked at the functions of safefood which was deemed fit for purpose and value for money.  In my view, this current review would seem to be a waste of time and money.  I am disappointed that the Department in the South agreed to this review as it shows a certain amount of naivety on its part because surely it would know that another review so soon afterwards is just a stalling tactic in an effort to interfere with the work of safefood.It is a concern that the chief executive, Mr. Higgins, has to deal with this current position.  The Stop the Spread campaign was very successful both North and South and I congratulate him on the award.  I weigh about one stone less because of the Stop the Spread campaign so less of me is delighted that Mr. Higgins is here today.  It must be recognised that those messages which safefood has been sending out, whether about folic acid or obesity, are very relevant campaigns which have an impact on the health of the nation.  safefood must be allowed to continue the work it has been mandated to do.  Yesterday, the health committee visited the regional neonatal unit in Belfast and the children’s hospital and we were informed of how obesity in pregnancy was having an impact on the health of the mothers and the babies.  Obesity is a very significant issue.  Therefore, the campaign needed to be cranked up a gear but instead there is a stalemate while waiting for the completion of this review.  If there is a delay in completion by a week or two, it will be July and everywhere in the North closes down in July.  I am very concerned about the way in which safefood’s functions are being interfered with by the Department, given that its stake is only 30% of the funding arrangements for safefood.  It is mind-boggling that the Department can have this impact on the functions of safefood.I ask that this committee should write to the two Departments both North and South, and invite representatives of both Departments to attend the committee to explain why this current review and its results are being allowed to interfere in this very important area of work across the island.  I thank Mr. Higgins for his attendance today and I ask him to keep the committee updated in advance of a further attendance, if this is agreed by the committee.As we heard earlier from the Human Rights Consortium, one Minister is trying to water down the involvement of safefood in its all-Ireland work.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	28	This is my first contact with safefood as an organisation and for that I am grateful.  If I could be so bold and I know it is probably my fault, in my view, there could be more outreach on the part of the organisation as this would be useful in terms of connecting with people like me.  However, it is my fault that I have not been engaged with the organisation.Considering the progress made by safefood and despite all these obstructions, what is Mr. Higgins’s view of the progress made by the organisation since its establishment?  Does he think the organisation is making progress in the right direction and has it achieved its potential?  Mr. Higgins discussed the nutritional aspects of obesity and such matters.  Does the organisation comment on alcohol consumption?  In my view, I do not think obesity can be discussed without discussing alcohol consumption.In regard to the Food Harvest 2020 project, does safefood have any input into policy regarding food exports?  Does it have any role in improving food production standards across the island in terms of the system of connectivity, traceability and so on?  I have asked a ragbag of questions, but it would be most helpful to have answers to as many as possible of them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Mr. Higgins said that safefood's business plans are currently awaiting the outcome of a review.  What impact has that had on the organisation?  Has its budget been agreed or is it effectively in a stalemate position whereby its business plans - which, I assume, management would have hoped to have agreed and progressed much sooner than this - are in abeyance until such time as both Departments carry out reviews that are parallel to or outside of the St. Andrews Agreement review that was agreed by both Governments?  What is the day-to-day impact on the organisation of business plans being left hanging until the Departments come back with an agreed proposal?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I will begin by addressing Dr. McDonnell's question on outreach efforts.  There has been a good deal of activity in this area.  For example, we ran an eight-week programme of weight loss support for Oireachtas Members and Members of the Assembly, as referred to by Ms Gildernew.  We have also given presentations to Members of both Parliaments on our activities and objectives.  We are always open to any scheme of improved outreach to those who have influence in the food environment, and will be pleased to follow up any suggestions in this regard.In regard to the progress that has been achieved, it is interesting that when safefood was set up in December 1999 the main driver was from a food safety perspective, as was the case with the Food Safety Authority and the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom.  That focus is reflected in the legislation governing those bodies, with very little reference therein to nutrition and obesity.  In the past 12 years, however, we have seen a shift in terms of the recognition of the threat represented by overweight, obesity and poor diet.  We have been very successful in improving awareness among people in both parts of the island in regard to the health implications of carrying excess weight.  A significant challenge in seeking to tackle obesity is that the extent of the problem is made increasingly invisible by environmental factors.  Cars are larger than they were 20 years ago, for instance, as are medical equipment and hospital beds.  There is a real sense in which being overweight and obesity have become the norm rather than the exception.  I often challenge colleagues to compare photographs of street scenes taken in Dublin, Cork or Belfast 20 years ago with similar photographs from today.  The difference in the size of people seen in these photographs is very apparent.Our success in raising awareness of obesity as a problem which affects us all is evident from our research, which shows that more than 90% of people recognise the associated challenges.  We have focused on simple measures to indicate overweight, such as the guideline that a waist size of 32 in. or more for women and 37 in. or more for men is indicative of a problem.  To clarify, these are merely indicators - as I have often said, a man with a 36 in. waist cannot be considered healthy if he is drinking alcohol to excess and consuming a diet consisting entirely of fried foods.  Nevertheless, the waist measurement advice offers a simple and useful tool for self-assessment.  Alcohol consumption is a complex issue which has a range of implications for individuals' health and for society in general.  From our perspective, there is an issue in terms of the calorie content of alcohol beverages, which is part of the consideration for a healthy diet.  The broader health and societal impacts are not within our remit, but we do work with other health promotion bodies in seeking to address the issue.  Likewise, physical activity is not within our remit but is a key factor in addressing obesity.  There is a need for a joined-up approach.In regard to food exports and improving productivity and traceability, it is increasingly recognised that the food industry is a major plank in recovery and growth into the future for the island as a whole.  While we have no role in regard to traceability systems, that being a regulatory issue, we are involved in a number of knowledge networks across a range of activities which had previously been primarily the preserve of academics and researchers.  We are opening up that network and there is increasing participation by people in industry.  This is a useful way of allowing us to contribute to the knowledge of food issues without being involved directly in the regulatory issues.In regard to our business plans, we are required to follow any instructions given to us by the North-South Ministerial Council.  There is no question that we are faced with uncertainty in the absence of business plan approval and that our long-term planning capacity is affected.  There are governance issues, for instance, when one is operating without an approved business plan.  The Chairman might have some comment to make in this regard.  We hope to see the issue resolved sooner rather than later.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	31	In regard to the business plans, as an advisory board member for four years and having now taken over as chairman, it is certainly clear to me that the delay in signing off on the business plans has had an impact on the organisation.  My main concern in this regard is that it is undermining all of the progress safefood has made in recent years, particularly in the area of obesity awareness.  Our Stop the Spread campaign has proved very successful, with market research showing that the 32 in. and 37 in. waist measurement guidelines have struck a chord with the general public.  Waist size is an easier measure to understand than body mass index, for example, and other methods of assessing whether a person is of a healthy weight.  safefood has established itself as the go-to organisation in regard to obesity, with our sponsorship of RTE’s “Operation Transformation” allowing us to get the message about healthy eating across to a large audience throughout the island.  Significant numbers have signed up to our website.  We are trusted by the public, which is very important against the background of so many fad diets and a glut of misinformation.  safefood provides clear guidelines on the small changes people can make to tackle overweight and obesity, rather than looking to fad diets for a solution.My main concern is that in the absence of an approved business plan and the associated uncertainty in regard to future activities, we may not be in a position to follow through on the Stop the Spread campaign in a timely manner.  This risks undermining all of the progress that has been achieved thus far.  People are aware of safefood’s function and are looking to the website as a trusted source of information.  That achievement will inevitably be undermined if there is a gap in our activity.  safefood is an all-island body and the Stop the Spread campaign has greatly enhanced its recognition in the North.  It is a great shame that politics are being played with our work, and I urge the committee to bring the matter to the fore of its consideration.  We must have a business plan approved in order to continue our work.  In terms of efficiency and cost effectiveness it makes no sense to undo all of the positive work we have done in recent years.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I thank Ms Ní Bhaoighealláin for being so frank and open in her reply.  It is important for us to have this information.  I will certainly work with Mr. Murphy, Ms Gildernew and others to do what we can to alleviate the situation.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Likewise, the committee will take on board what Ms Gildernew has suggested.  We will decide how to proceed at our private session discussion immediately following the conclusion of the meeting.Mr. Higgins referred to a joined-up approach in conjunction with other health promotion bodies.  With which other organisations does safefood already work?Reference was made to the television programme "Operation Transformation" and a result of that programme healthy options have been put on the menu in the restaurants in the Houses.  Is there a proposal regarding the food schools provide for students?  My daughter's school is strict about that.  Students can only bring in a treat one day a week and other than that it is pretty strict.The food on offer for children in restaurants can often be of the worst quality.  It may be chicken nuggets compared with what is offer for adults.  The issue of the food that is available for children in restaurants is important.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The Chairman mentioned the choices available in canteens.  That is the reason the workplace initiative was introduced.  We were involved yesterday with the nutrition and health foundation in the Dáil and Don Rice has been very helpful and interested in providing healthy options.In terms of moving people forward and influencing them, a number of strategies can be used.  They are often described as "hug", "nudge", "smack" and "shove".  The strategy in terms of "smack" is where legislation is introduced to make a practice illegal.  The tobacco legislation would be a typical example of it.   An example of a strategy in terms of "shove" is where the industry is encouraged to reduce salt levels in bread.  The strategy in terms of "nudge" is an interesting one.  It is where one pushes people in a direction.  I read evidence of where making opaque the clear perspex covers on ice cream fridges located next to the checkout in workplace canteens and moving them a little away from that location led to a 30% reduction in ice cream consumption.  There are opportunities to make such changes in the workplace but the position is different in the retail sector.  The strategy in terms of "hug" is where we support community groups.  We have seven demonstration projects in deprived areas of Cork, a project with asylum seekers in Killarney and several projects in Belfast.  This is where we support communities individually.  We cannot do that on a broad basis but we hope that the skills they learn can be transferred.I agree fully with what the Chairman said about the food on offer for children.  I have grandchildren and the food on offer for children when we go out for a meal can be quite poor.  I would like to see an option for children on the menu, which many restaurateurs have introduced, of half portions of the adult offering, instead of, say, chicken nuggets and chips.  The difficulty is in getting children to want that option.  This is where the parents come into the picture in exposing children at a young age to those types of foods and fruit and vegetables but it is a big challenge.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	35	With regard to our health services and how they treat one with food if one interacts with them, any time I have visited people in hospital, be it my wife when she was having a baby or a relative who was in for a procedure, I have found that after the procedure they were generally served toasted white bread.  At what stage does it become a "no-no" to offer that?  Patients are offered tea which is full of caffeine which leaches calcium out of their bones, leading to an increased chance of developing osteoporosis.  Regardless of what message one puts out to the public advising people to be healthy, if after all those expensive messages it is still the case that when one ends up in hospital one is fed complete and utter rubbish, one wonders if there is any joined-up thinking.  It does not make any sense.  I complained about it a few times when relations of mine were in hospital and the reaction I got was that this has nothing to do with health, that is one's own issue.  That is where the process should start.Another issue concerns advertisements that tell us that we should have a bath with disinfectant otherwise we will all die.  Such advertisements tell us to cover ourselves in disinfectant before we do anything.  There are handwash products on offer that are organised in such a way that one does not have to touch them in advance because one might get germs from them.  One of my constituents has a problem with hygiene in that they have a compulsive disorder and put plastic bags on their hands and feet to stop germs interacting with them and when opening a door they would have a plastic bag on their hand.  Since many of these advertisements have been aired, one of the arguments put forward by that person is that they are being proved right, that one should become totally disinfected before one does anything.  I would prefer to see my children run around in the muck developing their immune system.  The advertisements being run have my daughters almost convinced that they should be scrubbing themselves within an inch of their lives, otherwise they will come down with something.  I would like to hear Mr. Higgins's thinking on those two issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	36	On the hospital food issue I accept that has been the practice traditionally.  There is a recognition of the importance of a healthy diet, particularly for long-term patients.  I had meant to respond to the Chairman's comment regarding a joined-up approach and it touches on the issues Deputy Flanagan raised.  We set up an obesity action forum which allows all the bodies, whether they deal with the areas of physical activity, physiotherapy or cancer, to interact together and foster joined-up thinking.  On the issue of the food, there is an increasing recognition among clinicians that food is a key issue in regard to health, particularly for older people.  Many older people are malnourished not as a result of a lack of food but due to the change in their dietary needs.  Deputy Flanagan referred to osteoporosis.  There is a increasing recognition, particularly among people recovering from illness, of the importance of the role diet plays.  The challenge for hospitals is feeding large numbers of people within budget considerations.  There is a recognition among clinicians in hospitals that the food on offer, particularly for long-term patients, needs to be addressed.I agree with what Deputy Flanagan said regarding disinfectants.  Our recent research has shown that if one wants to keep a dishcloth clean, one should throw it in the washing machine because diluted bleach does not work.  There is a great deal of marketing around the need for sprays but we always say hot, soapy water is an issue.  There is no doubt that exposure at an early age to pathogens will increase resistance.  However, we must also remember that vulnerability is an issue in the case of young children, people who are immuno-compromised, pregnant women and so on.  Therefore, it is a question of balance.  It is interesting that in the 1950s, 5,000 children a year were dying in Dublin from gastroenteritis and much of that came down to food conditions, unpasteurised milk and so on.  I know there is a debate on the availability of pasteurised milk.  It is a question of finding the balance between exposure to pathogens which increases resistance and also dealing with those who are vulnerable.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	37	As I missed the bulk of the conversation, I do not want to repeat what has been said.  I congratulate and commend the work of safefood in its intervention at school level.  This is all about a mindset.  Any organisation that can add value by getting people to question traditional mindsets is important.  The big question that must be asked is where our food comes from.  We all take it for granted and once it arrives on our plate we just accept it.  We do not know from where the chickens and vegetables we eat come.  Some 30 or 40 years ago people knew that because they grew their vegetables in their back gardens.  The question of where our food comes from must start in primary and second schools.  I am aware that the groups do that intervention work on a North-South basis and they must continue doing it.On occasion groups are criticised and sometimes questions are asked as to whether there is a need for them when certain work is being done at a health service level or by the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a need for groups to become more aggressive in challenging Departments on what they are doing.  We are examining proposals on the location of chip vans near secondary schools.  Groups have an opportunity to become more aggressive in challenging the mindset.  I am aware that a good deal of intervention work is being done at an educational level through the schools, but there is an opportunity in that regard.  We should not accept the status quo.  I agree with Deputy Luke ‘Ming’Flanagan.  Neither we nor the parents know from where the food served in hospitals comes.  Having spoken to her, I know it would not win a Darina Allen food award.  We should know from where the food served in Leinster House comes.  Any group which challenges the mindset in terms of from where our food comes is important.  I, therefore, wish the delegates well in their continued good work.  I suggest the group should be more aggressive and challenge people within Departments because that is where the real debate must start.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-05-24 00:00:00	Prelude	39	We need to exert influence wherever we can.  Ours is not a regulatory body, but that does not absolve us in trying to influence the food environment.  One of the processes in which we were involved was with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland which, as members are aware, was involved in a consultation process regarding advertising to children.  We were involved in that expert group.  Providing an opportunity to present to Oireachtas Members and Members of the Assembly on a regular basis on issues that arise is important because they are the legislators and we should seize these opportunities.  We constantly challenge our sponsoring Departments and ministerial directions, but they are responsible for policy.  While we seek to influence it, we cannot write it.  We have been given permission by the public to be more aggressive because there is a recognition of the challenges presented, both on the food safety side and in regard to healthy eating.  We have taken up that challenge and hope to continue doing so.

The committee will take on board and follow up on some of the issues raised.
