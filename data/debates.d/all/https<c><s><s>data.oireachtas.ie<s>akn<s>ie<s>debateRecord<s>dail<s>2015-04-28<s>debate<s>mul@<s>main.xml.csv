We need to divide our time properly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I want to raise the issue of the commissioning of a review and the production of a report on the sale of Siteserv and other large transactions pertaining to IBRC and the decision of the Minister for Finance in that regard. I would make the point that there is a fundamental conflict of interest in allowing KMPG, which advised on the sale of Siteserv, whose personnel were involved with that company and which was also involved in the liquidation of IBRC, for which it has earned €70 million or more to date, to investigate the sale of the company. It is a fundamental political error on the part of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. It is a wrong decision. Belatedly the Minister acknowledged the conflict of interest and appointed a retired judge to monitor potential conflicts of interest. This is the first time I have ever witnessed the establishment of an investigation which, at the outset, acknowledges that there is a conflict of interest. While I am not casting aspersions on any individuals or the company involved, the bottom line is that this is wrong. It goes to the heart of independence and the need for an independent inquiry. The press release that was issued is incredible. It says that the Government wants the review to address recent speculation and concerns raised in the Dáil and "elsewhere". Could I remind the Taoiseach that the "elsewhere" is the Department of Finance. It was officials in the Department of Finance who raised grave concerns about the sale of Siteserv and other activities within the IBRC. There has been a lot of guff, publicly-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	-----in defence of the sale but the bottom line is that it was a very strange and wrong decision to allow the company to run the sale rather than IBRC. There was no logic in excluding trade buyers from the sale and the €5 million pay-off proves the point.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	4	Thank you Deputy.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	The company had skin in the game and that is why it should never have been let near the sale. Yesterday we had a farcical situation relating to activity on the share register and the promise from the Taoiseach that there would be full transparency.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	Deputy, please co-operate.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	11	-----establish a commission of investigation under the Act?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	12	The Deputy asked why we did not establish a commission of investigation. The interest of the Government here is for the taxpayer and that the facts in respect of the Siteserv sale should be made available as quickly as possible. The Deputy knows well enough that if a commission of investigation is set up to look at an issue like this there is a lead-in of a number of months and it can be a long time after that before a commission of investigation report is published. The Deputy would be the first out of the traps to say that the Government was involved in a cover-up, did not want this information to be made available and was engaged in secrecy and all the rest of it. In the interests of dealing with this matter, the Government decided to have the Minister use the authority he has to direct the special liquidator to look at all the issues and at sales of €10 million or in excess of €10 million and produce a report by the end of August. In addition, because all the files are in the possession of the special liquidator, it was decided to appoint a retired High Court judge to adjudicate on any case where there might be a perception of conflict of interest or whatever else. The special liquidator has been asked to deal with all transactions that occurred between 21 January 2009, the date of nationalisation of IBRC, and 7 February 2013, which is the date of appointment of special liquidators to IBRC. Therefore it is broader than the Siteserv transaction that was concluded by IBRC back in 2012. It is expected that it will cover approximately 30 transactions that were concluded by the board of IBRC in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and up to the date of liquidation of IBRC in February 2013. It is a much broader investigation here. That allows for the information relevant to these matters to be collated, produced and given to the Minister by the end of August. In the meantime a judge with the authority can adjudicate in any case where there is a perception of anything to do with a conflict of interest. That can then be transmitted here to the appropriate Oireachtas committees. As I have already said, if necessary the Government is quite prepared to legislate for a further independent analysis of this by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The only reason the board of IBRC was taking decisions that impacted on the taxpayer was the decision of the Government of which Deputy Martin was a member to guarantee the banks back in 2008 and nationalise Anglo Irish Bank in 2009, which caused absolute economic mayhem for hundreds of thousands of families in the country.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	By the way, the Taoiseach voted for the bank guarantee and actually asked that the bank guarantee be extended to other banks. So I ask him to stop the hypocrisy. The Taoiseach mentioned that the Government had no wish to cover up. However, it did cover up. The incredible and fraught relationship between IBRC and the Department of Finance was not revealed to the Dáil for three years. Comparing and contrasting the replies to parliamentary questions on the same issues from two years ago with those in the past month or six weeks show a big difference in terms of what is revealed. The Department of Finance officials wanted an independent review of the Siteserv deal back in 2012-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	33	Deputy Martin does not like the truth very often. When the Minister for Finance was able to do something about this, he changed the regulatory framework and appointed a senior civil servant to ask questions. The freedom of information letters to which Deputy Martin did not refer show exactly the level of regard that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had for the taxpayer in terms of asking the questions that should be asked. That is the reason it is preferable now to have an expeditious review of all transactions amounting to more than €10 million by the special liquidator provided on direction to the Minister for Finance and with a judge to adjudicate if there is any perception of conflict of interest. That report will be provided to the House by the end of August and the Government is willing to amend the law so that-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	42	The Taoiseach appears to insist on proceeding with a review into the IBRC scandal in which nobody has any faith. The review is simply an extension of the Government's cover-up of this scandal. When Deputy Pearse Doherty raised questions in 2012 on the handling of IBRC's sale of Siteserv, he was stonewalled by the Minister for Finance. At the same time, officials from the Department of Finance were bringing their serious concerns to the Minister's attention. Why did the Minister not reflect this in his written answers to Deputy Doherty? That was three years ago, and the Government has been sitting on this issue for all this time. It is another indication of the toxic relationship between big business and political parties such as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	44	Citizens see the contrast between the Government's attitude to the banks and the political and business insiders of the golden circle, and its treatment of ordinary citizens. Citizens are appalled by the massive write-downs that IBRC has given to private companies. The Taoiseach has no problem with these write-downs but he ensures there are no write-downs for mortgage holders by giving a veto to the banks. Last week the Taoiseach told the Dáil he knew nothing of the reports on how IBRC did its business or of the concerns expressed by the Department of Finance. When did the Minister, Deputy Noonan, inform the Taoiseach about the deep concerns of the Department regarding the sale of Siteserv and other IBRC deals?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	45	The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is more than capable of running his Department and dealing with the matters for which he has responsibility. The Minister informed us about the negotiations on IBRC in so far as the promissory notes were concerned. Deputy Adams stood up in this House, week after week and month after month, to ask the Government whether we were going to borrow €3 billion every March to pay for the interest on Anglo Irish Bank. The Minister rightly informed his Cabinet colleagues about the promissory notes, through which the Government secured savings of over €20 billion in the coming years. He is well able to deal with the issues arising within his Department. He informed the Cabinet of the discussions in regard to IBRC.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	46	When?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	47	I do not have the date but he kept us updated on IBRC because the promissory note issue continued for quite some time, as Deputy Adams is aware.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	48	I asked the Taoiseach when the Minister, Deputy Noonan, informed him about his Department's deep concerns with the Siteserv sale and other IBRC deals. Last week the Taoiseach stated that he did not know anything about this. Today, if I understand him properly, he is telling us the matter was brought to his attention and to the attention of the Cabinet.That begs the next question: what did the Taoiseach do about this? While he is valiantly giving the impression he is inquiring into these matters, he is in fact blocking a genuine independent investigation. We know, since it is on public record, that civil servants raised repeated and serious concerns about the sale of Siteserv and other deals. I do not know how much these transactions cost, but one can presume they cost hundreds of millions to taxpayers. We can also presume that the insiders gained by hundreds of millions. While all this was going on, a Siteserv subsidiary was granted the lucrative contract to install water meters. Was it on the advice of the consultants that Phil Hogan gave €85 million of taxpayers' money to that contract? It is clear a certain privileged elite became even more wealthy as a result of the financial crisis in this State and that the Government facilitated this. It is also clear that the only way to find out what exactly happened is to establish a commission of investigation. Is the reason the Taoiseach will not set up an independent commission of investigation because he does not want taxpayers, the electorate and citizens to know exactly what happened?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	49	I think that deep down the Deputy has problems with the institutions of this State. If the Government decided to set up a commission of investigation, Deputy Adams, along with Deputy Martin, would be first out of the traps to say this was a cover-up and that we were afraid to produce the evidence or information before any general election in spring next year, that we did not want to tell the people. That is the reason we do not have a commission of investigation.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	50	Answer the question.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	51	It is much more expeditious and more in everybody's interest that all the information about this be made available. Who has the files on this? It is the special liquidator. Who ordered the special liquidator to collate all of those files valued over €10 million where transactions occurred and to bring them back to him before the end of August? Who said that if necessary, the Committee of Public Accounts, chaired by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party who has no time for the leader or what he stands or does not stand for, would make a recommendation that there be an analysis of this by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	52	I am sure Deputy Adams believes in the independence and objectivity of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. That information, in terms of the public register, is now available for analysis as to who the shareholders were and who the stockbrokers were who purchased shares on behalf of clients. We also have a High Court judge to determine and adjudicate on any perception of conflict of interest in these matters about any of the transactions and to adjudicate on the commercial viability of any of the transactions mentioned. I understand there were 30 or so transactions over €10 million, but Minister Noonan did not deal with those with me. He was dealing with the IBRC and the promissory notes and he kept the Cabinet updated on those on a regular basis. As the Deputy knows, he was very successful in saving the taxpayer serious money over the next ten years and in not requiring the Deputy to jump up here every week to keep asking questions about borrowing €3.1 billion to pay interest debt in Anglo Irish Bank.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	53	Painted outside the Ministry for Truth in George Orwell's "1984" are the three slogans of the ruling party: "War is Peace"; "Freedom is Slavery"; and "Ignorance is Strength". Does the Taoiseach have any plans to paint slogans outside Government Buildings? If he does, perhaps he could add two more slogans to those three classics, namely, Competent is Compromise; and Independent is Dependent. Just last Thursday, the Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, came into the Dáil and repeatedly stated that what she favoured was an independent inquiry by a competent authority. Instead, we have a review by KPMG of a sale of Siteserv in which it was involved. This was a company on whose board a number of people with close connections to KPMG sat and in regard to a bank for which it acted as liquidator. Thus it was utterly compromised and utterly dependent and connected with those it is meant to be investigating and is incapable of providing any answers people will be satisfied with.Does the Taoiseach think this investigation meets what the Tánaiste was calling for last Thursday? Is it an independent inquiry by a competent authority? The doublespeak of the Government is not confined to this non-inquiry. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, in answers to parliamentary questions repeatedly indicated there was nothing to see here. With a question last December from Deputy Catherine Murphy that explicitly asked if the Minister was aware of higher bids for Siteserv, he did not answer that point. We know now that he was aware of such bids. The Minister was asked if he was satisfied that IBRC had acted in the best financial interests of the State but he did not answer the question; we know now that he was not fully satisfied to that effect. On 4 February this year, he was asked why he did not query the reason for such a large loss to the State.

Did he also mislead the Taoiseach or did he inform the Taoiseach of his concerns? The Taoiseach has been unclear about that in his answers. Forget about the promissory notes, as we are talking about the Minister's concerns relating to Siteserv. Was there a Chinese wall in effect? Does the Taoiseach have confidence in the Minister and does the Taoiseach agree that the Minister should now resign?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	69	Who has authority over the special liquidator? The Minister for Finance has ordered the liquidator to produce evidence and files in respect of all transactions over €10 million from 2009 to February 2013, inclusive. That is much broader than the Siteserv sale. Clearly, the appointment of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill is designed to cover the element of the review that will determine where there is any evidence of material deficiencies in IBRC's performance in respect of those transactions, related activities and management decisions, as well as whether it can be concluded that transactions were not commercially sound. With respect to the issues about the sale of Siteserv and others, all the information will be brought to the Minister before the end of the August. It will be brought to this House and the Committee of Public Accounts and others can have their views on it. I have already stated that if the Committee of Public Accounts considers there is a further necessity to examine any of these matters, the Government is prepared and happy to amend the law so that the Comptroller and Auditor General, with his independence, can look at this. I remind the Deputy that the IBRC board has defended its analysis and the Central Bank has examined these questions. There is a review ongoing, which will lead, if necessary, to a further completely independent and objective analysis. I say this as if the Government decided to have a commission of investigation, the Deputy would paint slogans outside the Dáil gates and argue that we are afraid to tell the truth and provide evidence or facts. That is why with this system, all these necessary pieces of information can be made available to the public. That is the interest of the Government with respect to the taxpayer. With regard to the Deputy's final comment, we cannot forget about the promissory notes. Perhaps the Deputy does not understand how that issue affected every single person in the country, as the Government was required by the gross incompetence of our predecessors to borrow €3.1 billion every year to pay the interest on the Anglo Irish Bank debt, whose rotten carcass was eliminated by this Government.

A broad inquiry is needed into write-offs in IBRC. We should not be misled and the Siteserv issue should not be included as part of a broader question. We must go deep into the rabbit hole that is Siteserv. We must start with the point at which Denis O'Brien, the richest and luckiest man in Ireland, had €100 million written off and got his hands on Siteserv and finish at the point at which he got his hands on a water metering contract worth €180 million. A specific inquiry is needed into that issue. It was clear at the time, as recorded a couple of months afterwards-----

If they are your people, you should speak to them. The Minister for Finance is very much in command of his Department. The Government has made a clear decision in the interests of everybody - the taxpayers and people - to have the facts and information provided as quickly and expeditiously as possible. The clear intention is that if Members of the House and its committees, including the Committee of Public Accounts, believe there is something else that should be looked at, the Government is quite prepared to amend the legislation to have, for instance, the Comptroller and Auditor General carry out a further independent, objective analysis of this matter. Deputy Paul Murphy is like the others. If the Government had decided to have a commission of investigation, he would say he did not want it, call for us to give the facts and the information and accuse us of delaying until after the general election next spring.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	112	Since taking office in 2011, the Government has been determined to fulfil the mandate given to us by the people, to repair the economy and public finances, to create jobs and to give hope and confidence to our citizens of a better future. The scale of the economic crisis that we have gone through has been unprecedented in Ireland’s history. We have essentially lost a decade in terms of economic growth and job creation. Difficult decisions have been taken and huge sacrifices have been made by the people. This has not been in vain, however. The spring economic statement published today confirms the path taken was the right one. As we now plan for the remainder of this decade, our citizens have every reason to be confident and hopeful about their future. It will be a future of steady, stable economic growth with more people working in secure and sustainable jobs than ever before in the history of the State. It will be a future of stable public finances that will deliver money in people’s pockets, higher quality public services and strategic investment in essential infrastructure throughout the country. Such a bright future, however, is not guaranteed and is contingent on a continuation of the policies and reforms introduced and being followed by this Government. There are external risks, no doubt, but the choices taken in this House also matter. A return to the “If I have it, I will spend it” ways of the past or indeed the “Even if I do not have it, I will still spend it” policy stance taken by the Opposition over the past four years is by far the biggest risk to economic growth, job creation and the prosperity of our people. Any rowing back on the reform measures through, for example, narrowing the tax base, increasing taxes on work and on businesses, halting labour force activation measures, or reducing Ireland’s competitiveness, will cost jobs, reduce growth rates and tax receipts and reduce the living standards of the people. Protecting and securing the hard-won gains of the past four years and building on them for the future is the priority. The facts clearly show the policies of this Government have worked and will continue to work in the years ahead. The economy is growing at the fastest rate in Europe, namely by 4.8% in 2014 while the Department of Finance is forecasting growth of 4% for this year. Steady, stable economic growth of 3.25% on average is forecast for the remainder of the decade. The recovery is jobs-rich, with 95,000 jobs added from the low point in 2012. My Department is forecasting we will pass the 2 million people in employment mark next year, replace all of the jobs lost during the downturn by 2018 and, in total, between 2015 and 2020, add 200,000 new jobs. Net outward migration is expected to cease next year with a return to inward migration from 2017 onwards. The young people who have left are coming back and will continue to do so. The public finances are under control with the deficit falling below 3% this year and debt levels are set to move down towards the European average in the next few years. As a result, we will be in a position to implement another expansionary budget this year and every year out to 2020, if this is deemed prudent and appropriate. We will meet our medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms over the forecast horizon. The Spring Economic Statement being published today sets out the policies to build upon the recovery and deliver these objectives over the remainder of this decade through a continuation of prudent, medium-term, focused budgetary and economic policies that will secure sustainable increases in jobs and in living standards. The April 2015 Update of the Stability Programme is also being published today and will be submitted to the European Commission later this week in line with our requirements under the European semester. The Spring Economic Statement is part of a much broader reform of the budgetary framework. The next phase in this new framework is the National Economic Dialogue which will take place in July. This will widen consultation on the budget with key stakeholders, while fully respecting the role of the Government and the Oireachtas to make policy. The National Economic Dialogue is about ensuring that we have an informed and mature discussion regarding both the short- and medium-term priorities. Full details on these reforms to the budgetary process are included in section 5.3 of the Spring Economic Statement, which has been circulated to everybody. Turning to the economic situation, I am greatly encouraged by the data flow over the last year or so, which clearly shows that the recovery is gaining momentum and, importantly, is becoming more broadly based. This is just the start of the recovery and the figures tally with what I see on the ground - more people are working, people have more income in their pockets, people are more confident about the future and businesses are being created and are expanding. Following GDP growth of nearly 5% last year, my Department is projecting GDP growth of 4% this year, with positive contributions from both exports and domestic demand. Over the remainder of the decade the Department of Finance estimates that the economy has the capacity to expand by around 3.25% on average per annum. Economic recovery is yielding benefits in the labour market. The figures show that 95,000 net new jobs have been created since the low point of the crisis, and the latest data show job creation in 11 of the 14 sectors of the economy reported by the Central Statistics Office. The Action Plan for Jobs has played a key role in bringing together all Government Departments and the target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016 will be met this year, a year earlier than committed to. Unemployment has fallen by five percentage points since its peak and we will continue to work to reduce it further. A continuation of the current strategy will see 2 million people at work by the end of 2016. The employment lost during the downturn will be recovered by 2018 and there will be more people working in Ireland by 2020 than ever before. Stable public finances are essential for economic growth and the first task of the Government was to stabilise the deficit and put it on a downward trajectory. However, the annual budget is not simply an exercise to meet a deficit target. The design of a budget is part of a much broader strategy to manage the economy for growth and job creation. In each of the budgets introduced since 2011, rebuilding the economy sector-by-sector has been a key feature. So unlike the past, in the future we will not be reliant on one particular sector – the construction sector – for jobs and growth, and the transactional taxes that flow from this. We must never again repeat the boom-and-bust economic model. Over the remainder of this decade we expect all sectors of the economy to contribute to growth and employment. In some areas, such as tourism and agri-food, the approach has been about building on our comparative advantage and exploiting new external market opportunities. The reduction of the VAT rate to 9% in the tourism and hospitality sector, the abolition of air travel tax, and tax changes to support farmers gearing up for the ending of the milk quota, have all proven very successful. In other areas, particularly construction, the focus has been on repairing a sector that was hugely affected by the crisis. The Government has presented plans to continue the sector-by-sector approach to growing the economy. I would like to give a few examples of the level of ambition embodied in these strategies. Our tourism strategy, People, Place and Policy – Growing Tourism to 2025, aims to increase revenue from overseas visitors by €1.5 billion to €5 billion and to increase employment in the sector by one fifth to 250,000 by 2025. The IDA's Winning: Foreign Direct Investment 2015–2019 aims to win 900 new investments for Ireland over the period to 2019, creating 80,000 new jobs and 35,000 net jobs. It also sets an objective of winning €3 billion in new research and development investment projects. Enterprise Ireland's Driving Enterprise and Delivering Jobs strategy to 2016 sets out a range of actions and initiatives that will create over 40,000 new jobs in Irish companies, increasing Irish exports by €5 billion to €22 billion by 2016 and beyond that to €27 billion by 2020. The international financial services sector 2015 to 2020 policy targets 10,000 new jobs in the IFS sector by 2020. Construction 2020 sets out the Government’s strategy for a renewed construction sector which can meet the medium-term demand for about 25,000 new dwellings a year over the next 15 years as well as the other infrastructure needs of the economy. The Government is driving a very ambitious and successful growth agenda for the agrifood sector under Food Harvest 2020. The strategy’s target amount for all primary output of almost €6 billion was virtually achieved by 2014, while a 42% increase in exports and a 40% increase in value added by 2020 remain on course to be achieved. The rapid development of new payments technologies is fundamentally changing the landscape and throwing up new opportunities and challenges. The advent of the single euro payments area, SEPA, has created a single, integrated payments market in Europe for the first time that can be developed further. Ireland is already an attractive destination for international payment firms but the Government wants to maximise our potential in this sector of the economy and has tasked Enterprise Ireland, in the IFS2020 strategy, with establishing a payments forum to review the positioning, opportunities and dependencies of the sector. Irish Water has set out an ambitious strategy to invest €5.5 billion between 2014 and 2021. The increased investment over the period ahead will be vital in ensuring communities can access reliable, high quality drinking water and sewerage services, and our economy can continue to facilitate and attract water-intensive industries – ICT, pharmachemical companies and agrifood – which, combined, currently provide well over 200,000 jobs. The investment is also required to prevent the massive wastage of water through leaks and to ensure a reliable safe water supply for all our citizens. This broad-based economic strategy is supported by a domestically refocused banking and financial system, beginning to lend into a much broader range of sectors. Banking supervision has been improved with a strengthening of the powers of the Central Bank, while at a European level the move towards a Banking Union is continuing. All of these will help prevent excessive credit growth in one sector of the economy in the future. It will also ensure that our small and medium businesses, SMEs, and households have access to multiple sources of low cost credit, an essential ingredient for growth. Addressing personal indebtedness is essential as our economy returns to strength. A mortgage is the single biggest debt most people will ever take on. The number of households unable to meet their monthly mortgage repayments increased with the decline in the economy, as incomes fell and unemployment increased. Supporting homeowners in arrears has been a priority for this Government and a broad strategy has been introduced to keep as many families in their homes as possible. This strategy has assisted borrowers and lenders reaching agreement to restructure about 115,000 mortgage accounts. As the economy continues to improve and incomes rise, the number of arrears cases is falling. However, there are over 37,000 mortgage accounts, representing about 30,000 homeowners, in long-term arrears of over two years. The Government is actively considering a range of options to strengthen the mortgage arrears framework in order to ensure that families in long-term arrears can find a solution. For the majority of these families the best route to a sustainable and binding solution is through engagement with their bank. Many others will find solutions through the options offered by the Insolvency Service of Ireland. The Government intends making an announcement on the issue in the coming weeks. A particular focus will be on enhancing the role of the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the range of solutions that become available through an insolvency arrangement.Access to credit for households is as important as access to credit for businesses, but the mortgage interest rates being charged by banks in Ireland have not been reduced in line with the rate reductions implemented by the ECB. I recently discussed this issue with the Governor of the Central Bank and he updated me on the ongoing work that the Central Bank is carrying out on this issue. The Central Bank will report back to me in the coming weeks and I intend to initiate during the month of May discussions with the six main lenders in Irish banking on the issue. I look forward to hearing their plans for reducing interest rates. Sustainable public finances are a prerequisite for improvements in living standards. The Government is committed to prudent management of the public finances in the years ahead and there will be no return to the boom and bust model of the past. This commitment is supported by the fiscal rules that are applicable to Ireland and all member states of the European Union. The fiscal rules are designed to support economic growth. The need to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP has been the anchor for our fiscal policy over the last number of years. This was a hugely important commitment and each year we set a target to reduce the deficit on a phased basis. Each year we overachieved on our fiscal target which sent a strong message to the public, SMEs, the FDI sector and investors at home and abroad that Ireland was regaining control of our public finances. This, in turn, led to increased confidence and investment and lower interest rates and borrowing costs thereby supporting growth and job creation throughout the country. Over the period 2011 to 2015, the deficit was reduced from €15 billion to €4.5 billion. These targets were achieved with fewer tax increases and expenditure cuts than originally envisaged when the troika was brought into the country. With the last budget, we reached the end of austerity budgets and did so much earlier than we had initially planned. The Department of Finance is now forecasting a deficit of 2.3% of GDP in 2015. There are obviously risks to this forecast and it is essential that discipline is maintained in the management of the public finances. With the deficit falling below 3%, a different set of rules will apply from next year and we will be required to make progress towards a balanced budget in structural terms. This will be the new anchor for budgetary policy and it is designed to ensure that budgetary policy supports economic growth. Put simply, it is designed to ensure that the days of "if I have it, I'll spend it" are over. The new approach will protect the Irish people from the boom and bust policies of the past. If these rules had been in place and properly applied and adhered to in the early 2000s, Ireland would have been far better positioned to weather the global financial crisis. As the House will be aware, the rules can throw up anomalies from time to time and I recently raised this issue with my European colleagues. What I was concerned to ensure was a credible application of the rules rather than a change in them. I am pleased to inform the House that the European Commission has accepted that we in Ireland have a strong point and agreed to a change in the application of the rules. As a result, the Government will be in a position to introduce our second expansionary budget in October.

The tables in the spring statement are based on a general split of €1.2 billion, but I expect that by October's budget this will be €1.5 billion. Current indications are that a similar amount of space will be available in later years while still ensuring the achievement of a balanced budget before the end of the decade. We must continue to reduce the national debt. The budgetary strategy we are pursuing will ensure that our debt levels continue to fall and that we are well positioned to withstand any shocks that may occur in Ireland, Europe or the global economy. The Government has been working hard to reduce the burden of this debt and that remains a key priority. We have succeeded in reducing the interest rate on the European loans provided under the programme, secured agreement to extend the maturity of the European loans, replaced the promissory notes with very long-dated government bonds, and replaced just over €18 billion of IMF loans with cheaper market-based funding.National debt peaked in 2013 and is now on a firm downward path. It is expected to drop below 100% of GDP and move towards the European average in a couple of years. Our net debt, taking account of cash the NTMA is holding and other assets, is of course much lower. The figures for debt which I have given are figures for gross debt. The cost of servicing the debt has also reduced. Interest rates on ten year Irish Government paper are below 1%, the lowest ever, and Irish Government debt is now classified as investment grade by all the main credit rating agencies. We are now in a much better position. Going forward, the fiscal rules require an annual reduction in the debt ratio by one twentieth of the difference between the actual level and 60% of GDP. Contrary to what some of the Opposition have stated, this will not require further consolidation by way of tax increases and expenditure cuts. This is because, with a growing economy, the debt-to-GDP ratio will fall once we run prudent fiscal policies. In other words, growth will do the heaving lifting.

The value of our investment in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB continues to rise. It is not the State's intention to remain a holder of its banking investments in the long term. The exit strategy is about recovering the full cost of the taxpayers' investment in these institutions and using the proceeds to reduce the debt further. The sale of 25% of Permanent TSB that concluded yesterday further improves the position. I am now confident that all the taxpayers' money invested in AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB will be fully recovered.

The forecasts for further budgets are contingent on continued sensible economic and budgetary policies being pursued. Prudent policies support growth and job creation and generate the taxes and the fiscal space for further investment in the economy. The scale of the fiscal space available in later years will be determined by the growth. If the wrong policies are pursued, the economy will not grow and the fiscal space will not materialise. Equally important to the size and scale of the budget plans is the type of measures introduced. As I have stated, lower taxes on income will support more jobs and higher taxes will cost tens of thousands of jobs. This is an economic fact. In the early 2000s, our taxation system became over reliant on transaction and property related taxes. The revenues from the property boom were used to fund a narrowing tax base to an unsustainable level and to fund current expenditure. The use of tax expenditures in the early 2000s not only served to hollow out the tax base but led to an overheating of the economy. When the property bubble burst, the revenues dried up and the consequences have been eight years of tax increases and expenditure cuts. The response of the Government of the day in the first instance was to load new and additional taxes on work through the introduction of the income levy and the universal social charge. We must never allow this to happen again and the base-broadening measures that have taken place have moved the tax base to a much more stable and growth friendly footing, reducing the reliance on transaction based taxes. The curtailment of tax expenditures, the introduction of the property tax and introduction of alternative funding mechanisms for vital public services such as Irish Water are all essential elements for stable public finances. The alternative policy choice in nearly all of these cases is to increase taxes on work, an alternative that can significantly impact on economic growth and jobs. That is why I did not increase income tax or USC charges in my first three budgets. At the first available opportunity, in budget 2015, I used available resources to reduce income tax and the universal social charge. Not only does this put more money into people’s pockets but it boosts confidence and economic activity across the country. The Department of Finance estimates, based on the ESRI economic model, that continuation of the programme of reducing tax on incomes introduced in 2015 for 2016, 2017 and 2018 would increase employment by approximately 1%. This is the equivalent of 20,000 jobs.On the other hand, the same research shows that increases in taxes on work would result not only in the loss of the additional jobs, but would actually reduce growth and cost jobs over the next five years. Unfortunately, the policies proposed by the Opposition will do exactly this. They will increases taxes, increase expenditure, increase debt, lower growth rates, reduce tax buoyancy and cost jobs. The policies of the Opposition will again cause the economy to spiral downwards. In fact, the principal domestic risk to Ireland's continued economic growth is the tax and expenditure policies of the Opposition.

The strong Exchequer performance, coupled with very positive high-frequency data on the economy, confirm the appropriateness of the economic perspective of the decision to reduce income tax and USC for every worker in the country. Putting more money into the pockets of people has boosted consumer confidence and demand in the domestic economy. It will also encourage young Irish people who are working overseas in good jobs to return home, confident that they will be able to find well-paid jobs in Ireland. The Government will continue to follow this policy in the next budget and in future budgets if the Government is re-elected.

Economic recovery provides us with the platform upon which to build for a future of economic growth, job creation and increased living standards. A Cheann Comhairle, we must never again repeat the mistakes that left Ireland on the verge of bankruptcy in 2010 and resulted in a lost decade and such hardship in the lives of so many people. The Government's strategy of steady, stable economic growth will benefit all our citizens. It will provide the resources for investment in our public services. It will fund the building of new schools, health centres and essential infrastructure. It will deliver secure jobs to more people than ever before in the history of the State. It will put more money in people's pockets and give people security around their income and their pensions. It will entice our emigrants to return home and they, in turn, will help to build a strong community in all parts of the country. I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, and I look forward to the contribution from my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and from the Opposition spokespersons on finance.

As the Minister for Finance has outlined, we are looking forward to having between €1.2 billion and €1.5 billion of fiscal space for budget 2016. We will allocate these resources, as he said, on an equal basis between additional spending and reducing the tax burden on low and middle-income earners. Additional investment may also be possible arising from reduced spending on unemployment payments as the numbers at work continue to grow. Today is about recognising the point we have now reached in our recovery and then setting out the context for budget 2016. Today is not an alternative to that budget; it is a point-in-time assessment of where we stand right now and the challenges we face. I want to outline some of the challenges facing public expenditure as our economy recovers. I will also set out some of the priorities on which we will need to focus over the coming years. I am confident we can build on the progress achieved if we continue, as we have done for the past four years, to make the right decisions. Having come through the worst economic shock in our history as a State, our primary focus must be, and will be, on sustainability. The Minister for Finance and I share one overriding priority. That is to ensure that what we endured as a nation over the past seven years never happens again. We will not throw away the hard-won progress the people of Ireland have made. As a result of the decisions we have taken, the State's finances are in a demonstrably better position. The imperative now is to ensure we continue to act responsibly. Last year, gross voted expenditure amounted to some €54 billion. This is a reduction of over €9 billion from the 2009 peak. During that period, current spending was reduced by nearly 10% and capital spending by half, albeit from historical highs. These reductions were made at a time of increased demands and pressures on public services. These included significantly increased numbers of people needing unemployment payments, more medical card holders, and additional students in the education sector. Unlike the demand in the private sector, which in a recession sees falls, the demands on public services increase during a recession. In addition, we are facing demographic changes that present challenges for our health and pensions system. A prudent plan for the public finances must prepare for those changes. The economic crash has taught us that nobody owes Ireland a living. We received emergency funding at a time when the markets stopped lending to us. We owe it to ourselves to ensure we do not allow a return to that position. That is why we have sought to broaden the tax base to prevent an over-dependence on property and transaction taxes, which contributed to the crisis in the State's finances. On the spending side, we are now planning our expenditure on a multi-annual basis, rather than from year to year. We have implemented a programme of reforms to improve the State's budgetary architecture. Today's economic statement forms the newest part of that reformed budgetary process. Additional reforms in recent years include the introduction of multi-annual expenditure ceilings, regular comprehensive reviews of public expenditure, publication of the updated public spending code, implementation of performance budgeting, and the establishment of the Irish Government economic and evaluation service. We have brought a greater level of transparency and efficiency to the allocation and spending of public money. None of these reforms is in itself a game changer and they are yet to bed themselves in the public mind. They do, however, represent a fundamental improvement in the way we do public business. It became fashionable for a while to decry this country and its potential. However, the turnaround we have achieved in our economy is indicative of the fundamental strengths of the Irish people and the Irish nation. We are now the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Our recovery from this crisis has been as remarkable as our original descent into it. Ireland is a small, open, flexible economy with the ability to react fast to changing markets. Our population is comparatively young by European standards. We have developed an ability to attract investment that is the envy of the rest of the world. The days when we could plan our economy in isolation are long gone. We are reactors to, not drivers of, global economic demand. We are dependent on the international marketplace to sell our goods and services and we are exposed to external developments. We have learned just how vulnerable we can be to a global downturn exacerbated by domestic policy mistakes.Our purpose into the future should be to mitigate these threats where we can, to build into our economy resilience, and to focus on how we can continue to grow our economy. Success in these efforts will allow us to build the society that reflects Irish values - one that is fair, caring and decent, one in which people are rewarded for work, and one where every region and county shares equally in the progress. Most in this House know that a fair society cannot be built on the back of a weak economy. The challenges that come with economic recovery have a context. Increases in public expenditure must be affordable. That is why the European Union has adopted rules to support sustainability. Endorsed by the Irish people in a referendum in 2012, the new fiscal rules serve as a tool to help us to responsibly manage our recovery. The rules mean that any future growth in public expenditure will not exceed the level of potential economic growth, unless we specifically levy additional taxes to fund it. For a country like Ireland where the national debt, as the Minister for Finance has indicated, is high, this is a lesson we do not need to relearn. These rules are new and hopefully will evolve over time and be refined but there is no denying the fundamental truth at their heart. Public expenditure must be sustainable. We must plan carefully, using evidence-based decision-making to ensure that we invest people's money in ways that will be of maximum benefit to the people of Ireland, not just for the next year or two but over the medium and longer term. As I have already indicated, reductions in spending have made a significant contribution to the overall fiscal consolidation. However, our approach was never to simply apply blanket reductions to all areas of spending. In the context of a poorly performing economy and a weak labour market, we recognised that we need to support economic growth and protect our society's most vulnerable people to the greatest extent possible.  Budget 2015 marked a very welcome point in our journey of recovery. It was the first since 2009 that reductions in expenditure were not required to meet our set fiscal targets. Now, as outlined in today's fiscal forecasts and in the documentation before every Member of the House, when we prepare for budget 2016 we can look forward to increased gross voted current expenditure by an additional €600 million to €750 million. This increase will allow Government to deal with underlying demographic pressures in key areas such as social protection, education and health. It will allow us to target enhancements in key public services.

As a proportion of the overall economy, Government spending is back now to roughly the size it was in 2001. Post-2016, the no-policy-change position outlined in the documentation before the Members is an annual increase of €300 million in current expenditure. Given the improvement in the fiscal position set out today, we expect there to be more space to accommodate additional spending. What we have done, simply, is that after next year we have factored in demographic pressures. The extent of this space, as the Minister for Finance has indicated, will depend on continuing to pursue the correct policies.  Ireland is changing. Over the last decade, our general population has increased by 500,000 people. We have the highest percentage of people aged under 15 in the European Union and the joint highest fertility rate. Life expectancy has also risen and now almost 13% of our population are 65 years old. These changes are positive and welcome and the envy of many countries, but they also present service and resource challenges for our health, pensions and education systems. On current projections, the ratio of working age people to those aged over 65 is expected to fall steadily from 5:1, which it is today, to just over 2:1 by 2060.By 2021 the number of our citizens over the age of 65 will have increased by close to 40% from a decade earlier. This represents an extra 200,000 people. Overall, this portion of the population is projected to increase from 11% in 2010 to 15% in 2020 and to 24% by 2060. In the health area, demographic changes alone will cost an estimated €200 million per year over the coming years. This is partly why our focus has been on extending the reach of primary care and taking pressure away from our acute hospital system.  We may be a younger country than many of our European partners but we too are facing pressures on pensions. We currently spend over €6.5 billion annually on pension provision. More than 400,000 people are in receipt of one of the two main State pensions, contributory or non-contributory. The cost of paying for these two pension schemes alone is projected to increase by €200 million per year out to 2026. Let me be clear, however, that there is no threat to the pension. This Government is committed to pension provision and to sustaining the value of the pension. It is because of this commitment that in our discussions on spending, it is important to be clear about future trends. Not enough of our citizens are planning for the future to supplement their State pension entitlements. It is in this context that the Tánaiste has set up a working group to examine the pensions issue. In education, the number of school children is, thankfully, set to increase every year over the next six years. By 2021 we will need an extra 3,500 teachers at primary and secondary level to provide education to an additional 50,000 pupils. The number of third level students is also projected to increase by 20,000 in the same period. These are welcome and positive developments but we must plan for them. Our economic future is bright as our highly educated work force expands but we need to plan to ensure our public finances can meet these real challenges. 
 Of course, we need to generate resources by growing our economy before we can spend money. On its own, the State cannot create wealth. Instead, it must do all it can to create the right conditions for prosperity through progressive taxation, appropriate regulation and targeted investment. Later, I will speak further on a number of the key areas for which investment is required– employment, education, infrastructure and public services. Before I do that, however, I should state that an economy is not a society. A functioning society is a fair one where the fruits of economic growth are shared among all the people. We are committed to continuing to provide necessary welfare and other supports to those who need them. That is why, throughout the crisis, we maintained core social welfare rates. It is also why, in the last budget, we increased child benefit rates, the living alone allowance and spending to address homelessness. It is worth pointing out that Ireland has one of the most progressive tax and welfare systems in the OECD. In fact, the most recent figures indicate that Israel is the only OECD country that has a more progressive income tax system than ours. Continued investment and growth in our economy will give us the resources to assist those who need it most. This goes to the heart of our economic model.
If we do not create the wealth we cannot redistribute it. We take the view that reducing unemployment remains the best route to recovery. It increases the tax base and allows investment in public services. By continuing to get people back to work we make our recovery sustainable. Irish people want to work. This has been a central focus of this Government’s efforts and we are now starting to reap the benefits. Employment has increased in every quarter for over two years and we expect this trend to continue. Almost 100,000 new jobs have been created since the low point in mid-2012. We are achieving success through a range of measures, including the Action Plan for Jobs and investment in key capital projects such as social housing. Tackling long-term unemployment will remain our key focus. Our Pathways to Work programme supports almost 260,000 places with 85,000 of these reserved specifically for the long-term unemployed. In budget 2015, we doubled the number of positions on the JobsPlus scheme to 6,000, encouraging employers to hire the long-term unemployed specifically. Not only is the headline unemployment rate important; we must also increase employment throughout the country for all groups in our society and with this in mind, we introduced the Back to Work Family Dividend in the last budget. A related issue is child care. A successful child care policy helps people who wish to do so to participate in the economy. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has established a working group on this issue and the Government looks forward to reviewing the outcome shortly. Obviously, we need to find a balance between the needs of children, parents and the wider economy.

All of these initiatives are aimed at providing real opportunities for those in need of work and allowing those who were forced to leave Ireland to come home. This Government has overseen improved outcomes in education. There are more students at higher level and more are taking higher level maths. Literacy rates among our 15 year olds have improved and the number of PhDs awarded by Irish universities has increased. This reflects our belief that the quality of our education system is a key determinant of future living standards. In the last budget we announced 1,700 additional full-time education posts. In the lifetime of this Government, more than 150 new schools will have been built. It is extraordinary that we built more schools during the worst recession in our history than were built in the boom years. At under-graduate and post-graduate level we are providing higher education programmes and services for over 164,000 full-time students. We are also providing 270,000 places on further education and training programmes. We will continue to invest in education. We must embrace the skills revolution, adopting strategies to ensure continuous upskilling and development of our work force to allow our citizens to be at the forefront of new technology and the creation of high-value jobs. The potential of the Irish people is enormous and our aim is to help them to realise that potential. Thanks to economic recovery, we are now in a position to increase investment in our people and our infrastructure. We will do this in a strategic way, ensuring maximum value for money, with a focus on future needs. The capital review undertaken by my Department will inform a new capital plan which will be published in June. This plan will take our capital funding horizon out to 2020 and identify priority areas for investment. Infrastructural constraints can act as a brake on growth, reducing the productive potential of our economy. We also need a proactive approach to dealing with climate change and its future impact. Investment is needed in parts of our school system, road network, public transport, social housing, broadband infrastructure and flood alleviation. Spending in these areas will increase our capacity for growth, our ability to respond to social needs and enhance our environment. As I have already indicated, capital expenditure has fallen considerably since the peak. That was the correct thing to do at the time because we simply had not got the money. There is no point in investing to extend one’s house if one cannot pay the grocery bill. It is now time to invest again to meet our infrastructural needs and this will be reflected in the capital plan, particularly in the years beyond 2018.
We now have a considerably smaller, less expensive and more productive public service. Having served in government for the past four years during this crisis I am proud of how those in the public service have responded to the additional workload and the productivity changes demanded of them. These changes and the reductions in pay have allowed us to minimise the effects of the crisis in essential areas such as health, education and social protection. Indeed, public service reform has allowed us to provide additional resources to front-line services, a process that I have called the reform dividend. We have added more than 1,000 nurses since 2014. We recruited 300 gardaí last year. This year we will take in 250 more.

The pay reductions are governed by financial emergency legislation that requires me to carry out an annual review of the status of that emergency. As the economy continues to improve, the prospect of legal challenges to the financial emergency increases. It is prudent therefore to plan for an orderly unwinding of these emergency provisions. Not to do so would be foolhardy. I do not intend to discuss the negotiations on the floor of the House today, but let me say this. All public servants have had their pay reduced significantly. Over the past two years, we have seen the beginnings of pay awards in the private sector. As the economy recovers, we need to ensure that remuneration and the cost of the public service generally are managed to ensure that they remain sustainable. Of course, without the productivity gains made in recent years, we would not be in a position to discuss unwinding the financial emergency measures in the public interest. Given their value to the State, the unwinding of those measures will take time. To do anything else would jeopardise the public finances again, something the Government will not do. In order to meet the challenges that we face, it is essential that we engage with people. This spring economic statement represents the beginning of that process. Every Government has a duty to engage with its citizens. The Government also has a responsibility to ensure policy making is consistent with broader societal and economic objectives. A national economic dialogue between Government and relevant civil society groups will discuss the most effective and equitable way to achieve our objectives. Those groups will also have obligations. That holds not only for groups that want more expenditure in every area we can think of, but also of the parties opposite. We cannot meet all the demands of each and every person or group. To try to do so would bankrupt the State. Proposals for increased expenditure should be matched by genuine attempts to find matching funding, commensurate with the proposed expenditure. No party can ignore the general parameters under which public policy has to be made. Our engagement, as a Government, with all groups will be firmly rooted within these parameters. While these discussions will inform the process, it is the Government of the day that will make the decisions. It will do so on the basis of what is in the long-term best interest of our people.  I repeat that we must not allow this country to return to the devastating cycle of boom and bust that has been the hallmark of previous Administrations. We must learn the lessons of the past decade and not repeat the mistakes that brought us, as a country and as a society, to the edge of ruin. Our vision and plans for renewed prosperity will not be built on the sand of short-term and unsustainable increases in Government spending. They will be built on the rock of fiscal responsibility and investment in the productive capacity of our people. Since 2011, we have provided stable and responsible government. We have stood up for the people and charted a path to recovery. We cannot and will not throw money at problems. Expenditure growth must continue to be linked to performance and reform. Any increases in expenditure and incomes must be in line with growth and productivity. Decision making must be evidence based with a strategic focus on improved outcomes for our citizens.

Built up as some kind of mini-budget, it has ended up as just another PR exercise from a Government that is quickly running out of road. At the end of all this, people who have been hearing about the spring statement for months will be left scratching their heads wondering what it was all about. I cannot find a single element in today's statement that will bring any short-term benefits to families. As an alternative the Ministers could have said in today's spring statement that the bank veto would end immediately; that they would not tolerate the excessively high standard variable rates banks are charging; that any family making a reasonable and honest effort to pay their mortgage would not be kicked out of their home by the bank; that the almost 1,000 children living in emergency accommodation in our capital city today would immediately be given reasonable and permanent accommodation; and that in light of the improving economic situation the Government would introduce emergency legislation into the House tonight to restore the €325 cut to respite care grant so that come June when the payments for 2015 are made the full payment to carers would be reinstated. Instead we got none of that. We got an exercise in self-congratulation, a self-serving statement from both Ministers clapping each other on the back.

It raises fundamental questions for us as a people. What kind of recovery do we want? Do we want a fair and inclusive recovery across the economy? Do we want to bridge the divide between urban and rural? Do we want to bridge the growing divide between those who have and those who certainly have not and have lost most under the Government's tenure? I welcome that the Government has made a fundamental shift in its budgetary policy today. It has moved from the situation, when it was introducing austerity, where it had €2 of expenditure cuts for €1 of tax increases. Today it has shifted to what we have been advocating for a prolonged period of time, which is a 50:50 scenario. However, it has done enormous damage to the fabric of society in the manner in which it has introduced fiscal consolidation in the last four budgets. I know the Minister does not want to hear it and he is shaking his head in denial. He is in complete denial of what is going on out there. He is in denial about the thousands of young children with special needs who are awaiting urgent intervention services. He is in denial about the many elderly people throughout the country who are being denied access to nursing home beds because of cuts to funding.I referred earlier to the 1,000 children who will be sleeping in emergency accommodation in Dublin tonight. A full Croke Park on all-Ireland final day accommodates more than 80,000 people. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, can imagine County Limerick in the final if he so wishes.

We must evaluate the statements made thus far today through the prism of these individuals' experiences of waiting for urgent appointments or who are living with debilitating conditions. I can provide examples from my own area which will be repeated throughout the country. In Cork alone, the number of people waiting to see an orthopaedic hospital consultant has increased by one third in 18 months. The numbers waiting to see an ophthalmologist have increased by 55% in the same period. The number of women waiting to see a gynaecologist has increased by 37%. Where is the recovery for those people? The Government is not giving them any light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the future of this country. This is why last October, in a departure from the usual politics of opposition, we advocated investing in these critical service shortages given that we had the headway to do so for the first time in the eight years. The Government did not take our advice, however. With each passing month this Government remains in power, the divisions in society grow deeper. Those divisions have been exacerbated by the regressive budgets it has implemented in the past four years, which have proportionately taken much more from those on low and middle incomes than from those on the highest incomes. The Government's ideology was exposed last October, when for the first time in almost a decade there was scope to give something back. The Government gave it back to those on the highest incomes. The main changes to the income tax changes in the budget were to the higher rate of tax, and benefitted only one out of six income earners.

I could play the Minister a few tracks from a CD dating from five or six years ago which would include familiar voices from his own benches. We need a fair and broad based recovery. Towns and villages across this country are dying but the Government does not seem to care one iota about them. It is creating deeper and deeper divisions. No sooner was the ink dry on last October's budget when speculation started about the new departure of a spring statement in which a range of new initiatives and ideas would be unveiled by the Government. I would use all of my remaining time if I outlined the list of carefully orchestrated leaks to the media about the range of benefits that would be unveiled by the Government in the spring statement. We have seen nothing of the sort in this statement. The documents released today contain nothing new.

The number of people out of work is falling and the number of people with jobs is increasing. We warmly welcome that but there is no room for complacency when 350,000 people are still on the live register, as well as 86,000 on activation programmes. While I do not seek to demean activation programmes and their role as a stepping stone to real employment, these numbers reveal the scale of the crisis of unemployment. Approximately 160,000 people are long-term unemployed. We need to take a number of steps to deal with this issue. Among the leaks made in recent weeks was a suggestion on supporting self-employed people by extending a tax credit to them that is equal to the PAYE credit. There was no reference to that suggestion in the Ministers' statements.

Successive Governments discriminated against them in the taxation system and in their failure to provide a safety net through the Department of Social Protection. The Government had an opportunity to deal with that issue today. As the employment situation recovers, we also want to see decent terms and conditions for employees. This Government promised a lot in that regard but it delivered very little. It is running out of time to deliver on major reforms of the labour market, and they need to be introduced without further delay. In regard to the role of local enterprise offices, I recently had occasion to help a local SME which was not involved in exports. It was directed to the local enterprise office to get financial support. We get lip-service from the Government on supporting SMEs as the heart beat of the economy providing 800,000 jobs. The aforementioned company inquired into what practical assistance it could get, such as a grant to purchase equipment or employ staff, but it could get nothing because financial support is provided only to businesses engaged in manufacturing or internationally traded services. If this Government is genuine about supporting the small business community, it would deal with this type of issue very quickly. The Government has promised tax reform but it has not addressed the major increases that people will face in the future. Mortgage interest relief is due to come to an end in 2017. Mortgage interest relief amounted to more than €400 million for nearly 500,000 families in 2012. It was worth €260 million last year. The ending of that relief in 2017 will be an effective tax increase which will offset the figures outlined today. The Government is determined to pursue universal health insurance. The White Paper it introduced on this subject last year contained a strong hint that tax relief on private health insurance, which has been already dramatically reduced, could be ended. In 2014, that tax relief was worth €350 million. The White Paper sneakily revealed a proposal to subsume the relief into the overall system for financial support for universal health insurance on a revenue neutral basis. That means people who currently pay for health insurance will be paying a hell of a lot more because the tax relief they currently enjoy will be gone. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, failed to address the issue of the local property tax. He commissioned a review from Don Thornhill but he could have nailed the matter today. Dramatic increases in local property tax rates following next year's revaluation could be avoided if the revaluation does not take place. He could have thereby put people's minds at ease. He outlined a package of €1.5 billion in taxes and spending in 2016 but he did not mention the other factors which directly affect household budgets. The Minister's comments on banks and interest rates are weak and watery. There is nothing in what he said. I expected, and God knows there were plenty of leaks to the media in recent days, that there would be a significant statement from the Minister for Finance today. Previously, he came into the Dáil thumping his chest and saying the banks would have to deal with the issue of the standard variable mortgage rates, but we got nothing of the kind. Tomorrow, the CEO of Bank of Ireland will come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. He will tell it that the cost of funds for Bank of Ireland currently is 1.03%, effectively 1%, yet it can continue to get away with charging 4.5% on standard variable mortgages across the country. Some 300,000 people are paying way over the odds on their standard variable mortgages, yet the Government has arrived very late to this debate. It was dragged kicking and screaming into the debate having shown no interest in the issue. The Minister said it was a commercial matter for the banks and he would not get involved. We heard that many times. However, the penny has finally dropped that people will not put up with the situation. The issue is gaining a head of steam. An interest rate of 4.5% being charged at a time when the cost of funds for the banks is around 1% is unacceptable. As Minister for Finance, the Minister has a duty to speak up for ordinary people on this, as does the Governor of the Central Bank. We need to see progress on this issue because the current situation is not good enough. People will not be bought off with a 0.25% cut as the difference between the rate charged in Ireland by the banks and the rate charged in the eurozone is just over 2% at 2.09%. The Minister is aware of this yet he missed an opportunity today to lay down a firm marker in respect of saying he expects progress on this issue. His words were far too weak. Where is the promised package of measures to deal with the problem of mortgage arrears? For weeks we have been hearing in the media about measures to dilute the bank veto and new measures to reform mortgage to rent schemes, but the Government cannot seem to get it together because its members cannot reach agreement among themselves on the issue of reducing the discharge period from bankruptcy. All this time, families who are struggling to hold onto their homes are paying the price. The official figures from the Central Bank show that the banks have proposed to take 30,000 family homes from people across the country and they say they have concluded solutions in respect of 16,000 homes. I hope this will not come to pass. I hope negotiations will take place and that these will result in sustainable restructurings being put in place in respect of these mortgages. Currently, the banks hold all the aces. The Government has given them more and more power. It has diluted the rights of mortgage holders in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and has allowed thousands of other mortgage holders have their mortgage sold from under their feet. They have been left powerless and are at the mercy of foreign owned vulture funds who can treat them as they like. Those mortgage holders have nowhere to go to vindicate their rights. They cannot go to the Department of Finance, to the Central Bank or to the Ombudsman and have been left hanging in limbo. The Minister has introduced legislation and we are awaiting Committee Stage of that legislation. I do not like how the Minister proposes to amend that legislation, but we will have that debate on Committee Stage. I urge the Minister to accelerate the legislation as it is vital for people who find themselves in this situation. The bottom line is the bank veto needs to be removed. It is all very fine for the Minister to say the banks only use it in 25% of cases, but the people know it is there and know they will not get any restructuring of their mortgage unless the bank agrees. This is not good enough. The Minister seems to be coming around to the view that he must do something on the bank veto. We told him this was necessary over three years ago. We told him the way the insolvency service was being set up would result in the banks holding all the aces and homes being unnecessarily repossessed. The frustrating fact is that the solutions exist, for example a proper split mortgage with no interest accruing on the warehoused portion of the mortgage. The banks are open to writing down debt. They should be, because the Government, the previous Government and the people have recapitalised them. They have more than adequate buffers to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears, yet they are singularly failing to do so. The Minister needs to bring forward the long-promised package of measures in respect of mortgage arrears and to deal with the issue of bankruptcy. We support the reduction in the discharge period to one year. If nothing else, that would put manners on the banks and force them to come to the table to negotiate a settlement. The bottom line is that the family homes of well over 100,000 ordinary families around the country are in mortgage arrears. These people should not have to become bankrupt to deal with their mortgage indebtedness. They deserve to get a proper restructuring of their mortgage and this should be done within the confines of the Central Bank code of conduct, the targets programme the Minister unveiled and through the insolvency service if needs be. Fianna Fáil has outlined a number of other key changes we believe would make a real difference to the economy. We talk a lot here about an enterprise economy and about supporting entrepreneurs, but Ireland is being left behind. Let us be honest about that. When I look at the international trends in corporation tax and how entrepreneurs are treated, Ireland is now in the halfpenny place. The United Kingdom, for example, has relief for entrepreneurs of 10% in respect of capital gains tax and has also introduced a 10% patent box on intellectual property. Much of the investment Ireland is competing for now is highly mobile. We are operating within a hugely competitive marketplace and need to be conscious of that. The Minister has started what I would regard as a dangerous trend, of diluting our corporation tax offering. Companies making decisions need absolute certainty about the corporation tax environment in which they will compete. It is in that context that Fianna Fáil opposed the measures the Minister brought forward on that issue. We have brought forward our own proposals on a special entrepreneur capital gains tax relief which we believe would make a significant difference. We have unveiled other proposals on DIRT and a range of other issues and we will have an opportunity to tease these out. The Minister says the biggest risk facing the economy is domestic and political. I am not sure who he is pointing the finger at when he is talking about high taxation and high spending. That, as he knows well, is not the Fianna Fáil policy.

He never had the good grace to acknowledge the favourable external factors the Government and the country are benefitting from, the historic low interest rates which he knows are extraordinary - that a country like Germany is being paid money to borrow and that Ireland can borrow money at less than 1% over a ten-year term. The Minister knows this will not continue and knows this is being driven by ECB policy. It is being driven by the massive quantitative easing programme by the ECB, the Bank of England and the Fed. The Minister knows that, but it warranted only a passing mention in terms of the risk this country is facing. As an export-led economy, the Minister knows well that the current foreign exchange rate and weakness of the euro has transformed the export landscape within which companies are operating. However, he did not see fit to acknowledge that or even to mention it as a risk for the economy. Nor did he mention the strength of our trading relationships with the United Kingdom and the United States, which thankfully have insulated us against a pretty anaemic eurozone economy. The drop in oil prices did not do us any harm either. The Minister could at least have acknowledged all of these factors. There was no mention today of the bank debt deal. I assume that is dead in the water. The Minister spoke about national debt and banks, but did not mention the bank debt. Will he come clean with people and acknowledge that the June 2012 game-changer or seismic shift will not happen or that Government policy has changed? He has been dropping little hints here and there in a cute way, but he should just come out and say it. The bank debt deal seems to be off the table and the Minister should acknowledge that. What the people want is a fair recovery. We want the Minister to be honest in what it is saying to people. We want a progressive recovery that will benefit all parts of the country and all sections of society. Today was a self-serving exercise for the Government in congratulating itself. People will be deeply disappointed.

I have studied the two documents and there is very little in front of us of real significance and relevance to people today. The first document is the April 2015 update on Ireland's stability programme. The second document is the 2015 spring economic statement. Essentially, the two documents are the financial envelope to pay for the election promises of Fine Gael and Labour. The Government has never done this before. A moment ago, the Minister made virtue of saying that finances should not be dictated by the electoral cycle but that process has been invented today. We had similar documents last year and in previous years but because there is to be an election within 12 months, there is a set-piece today. Essentially, the Government is standing down the Dáil from its proper business for a week so we can discuss its financial envelope for the next general election. That is not an appropriate way to start this business. The Government has lectured others about spending money in electoral cycles but we have never seen the likes of this happening before. People may ask about what we are talking and specifically what election promises have been made. These are promises that have been announced by Ministers in recent weeks or since the beginning of the year. That is excluding everything that has been in the newspapers for the past 48 hours. In the past two to three months, Ministers have promised more paid maternity or paternity leave, tax relief for landlords who agree not to increase rent and a free second year of child care, as well as tax reliefs and subsidies for child care. Another Minister promised to abolish the public sector pension levy, while others have indicated the introduction of a living wage and rates holidays for small start-up businesses. Yet another Minister has indicated the self-employed should be given the same jobseeker's allowance entitlements as people who are in the PAYE system. Ministers have spoken about the reduction of the universal social charge for self-employed people and bonus pay for couples if they split paternal leave. Ministers have spoken about the removal of the bank veto on personal insolvency arrangements, although there has been nothing about that today. Others have spoken about the return of the first-time buyers' grant, with Ministers - including those who spoke today - talking about increasing the bank levy to force banks to reduce variable interest rates. These are the specific promises contained but not mentioned in today's financial envelope. These were mentioned even before the two most senior Ministers from a finance perspective came out with their list over the past few days of what they propose to do in order to buy the election in the next 12 months. The people of Ireland will see this for what it is. I know the Government might feel the people of Ireland should be more grateful for the reductions made in the top rate of tax last year or that it should be doing better in terms of public esteem. The Ministers might be disappointed that people are not thanking them on the street.

The Government has sought to hijack the Dáil for a week and take over the media so that people will hear Ministers congratulating other Ministers on a wonderful job being done. They got their time but the exercise may be counterproductive. The public will see this for what it is, which is pure political spin. The Government is doing us a disservice. Is this what it meant by "democratic revolution"? Is that the setting aside of Dáil time so we can all come to listen to Ministers for hours and days on end? We will listen to senior Ministers today, the Taoiseach tomorrow and the next line of Ministers after that. Maybe there will be two weeks set aside in the autumn to discuss the budget. That seems to be what the Ministers see as the democratic revolution. It is an abuse of this House to turn it into the launchpad of a general election campaign. I have examined the documents. There were contradictory statements in them. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, stated that the finances of the State are now in a demonstrably better position as a result of the decisions taken by the Government. The Government is congratulating itself and the Minister is nodding in agreement with his statement. That says it all.

That is why we have stability programme updates. The Irish people decided by referendum that we would not have runaway Governments any more and we will not spend money we do not earn. The Irish people decided if there is a major debt, we will take steps to reduce it. All the Government is doing, correctly, is implementing the democratic decision of the Irish people as public servants. The Government has no legal authority to do anything other than comply with the referendum result and the financial packages set out by Europe. We accept that but the Ministers have argued that the wonderful achievements in the economy arise from their actions. They should not delude themselves. The Irish people passed the referendum to allow this to happen; it is their work and sacrifice that is responsible rather than the work of a Minister. For the first three years, the Government followed the agreement in place with the troika. It now has to follow EU rules on managing finances from now on, which is quite proper. We can consider the big ticket items of this Government, which the Ministers had a role in and which they chose to follow but which are outside of the previous programmes. When the Government makes a decision which nobody else asked it to implement, how does it measure up? Where are the big ticket items in the announcements from the Ministers? The documents set out projections for Government debt, for example. The question must be asked as to whether Irish Water is today a standalone, commercial semi-State company or on the Government's balance sheet. The straight answer is that it is on the Government's balance sheet. The Government indicated that in setting up Irish Water, it wanted to make it an independent semi-State company and have it operating on normal commercial business lines. Both the Government and Irish Water have failed to meet this objective. Last year, EUROSTAT rejected the Government's proposal to have Irish Water taken off the Government's balance sheet and on a second occasion, EUROSTAT again rejected taking it off the Government's balance sheet, as per the statement issued four weeks ago. That is the second time the Government has been refused. That is extraordinary, as the Taoiseach came before a committee to discuss Estimates for his Department in February, with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, coming under that remit. On 28 February, just a short while ago, he told the Oireachtas committee dealing with finance and public expenditure that the CSO was "working to finalise the report in the next two to three weeks" and that the assessment "will then be provided to EUROSTAT". The Taoiseach indicated that the CSO was advised that the final response from EUROSTAT is likely to take at least two months from date of receipt, and it is clear that the Taoiseach gave the impression that we would have a decision on this matter by the summer. That is not true and the Taoiseach did not know about what he was talking; EUROSTAT made it quite clear that it will be the end of October before it makes any further announcement on the classification of Irish Water in the national accounts. The Taoiseach told the committee one version but EUROSTAT stated some weeks later another version. The Taoiseach should have known this as it only makes classifications on national account issues twice per year. There will be much discussion today about funds available for taxation purposes and increases in expenditure. We can consider how the Government handled its biggest project, which is the €1 billion of expenditure that has gone into Irish Water, and that leads to questions about its ability to run affairs when the Government is not governed by an arrangement we put in place or which the EU did instead. To date, €1 billion in taxpayers' money has been spent setting up Irish Water, and we have all heard about the payments for bonuses and consultants. The Government has forced the Irish taxpayer to pay commercial rates bills to local authorities for Irish Water.In the first phase of the installation of water meters, various contractors have incurred additional costs. They include Siteserv, which will seek additional funding from the Government arising from the difficulties it is experiencing in installing water meters. When these costs are combined with the cost of the new conservation grant, one finds that the cost of phase one will be more than €1 billion. This figure excludes the one third of all motor taxation receipts that has been siphoned off from the local government fund and handed over to Irish Water as a direct subvention. The second phase involves the installation of an additional several hundred thousand water meters. The cost of delivering this phase, which will run to several hundred million euro, has not been included in the figures. None of this expenditure will be used to improve water infrastructure. The employees of local authorities who have always carried out this work on the ground are being asked to do more for less. Irish Water is a €1 billion failure, a financial fiasco that must be abolished and the Fianna Fáil Party in government will abolish it.  The corporate governance of Irish Water is fundamentally flawed and unacceptable. The company is part of the Bord Gáis-Ervia group of companies. The Government constructed Irish Water in a manner that ensured its board does not have one independent external director. This practice is unacceptable and should not be allowed to continue. The board consists of staff in the Irish Water-Ervia group and it is not fit for purpose. Is it surprising that a controversy has arisen regarding the appointment of major contractors such as Siteserv to Irish Water when the company's board does not include a single external director? This approach shows how the Government set about establishing its pet project. It should not have been allowed.  The Government promised to eliminate cronyism. Last year, in an example of Government cronyism, it appointed a person to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art in order that the appointee could be elected to the Seanad through the back door. Subsequently, Fianna Fáil proposed legislation to ensure all appointments to State boards would be made on a statutory basis. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, single-handedly rejected this approach, stating that he had requested Ministers, on a voluntary basis, to do the right thing. It is hardly surprising that cronyism persists when the Government refuses to address appointments to State boards. It is clear to anyone who has observed recent events that for several years the Minister has sat on information held in the Department of Finance on Siteserv. He has decided to establish an inquiry solely because the matter has entered the public arena. If these issues were of concern to him two years ago, he should have established an inquiry at that time. It should not be necessary to shame him into taking action through the release of documents under freedom of information legislation. As I stated immediately after the Minister spoke on this matter on radio last Friday, the inquiry he has established is by insiders into insiders. It is cronyism to have insiders inquiring into themselves. It is also wrong that the Minister issued, under IBRC legislation, a direction to the special liquidator that he carry out this review. I understand the Minister did not consult the special liquidator before directing him to do this job on his behalf. In doing so, he has abused his ministerial powers and forced a conflict of interest on the special liquidator. As Deputies have thrashed out in the House, the special liquidator is not a suitable person to carry out the review owing to the conflict of interest that arises. The fig leaf of appointing a retired judge to monitor the issue is wholly insufficient. It amounts to an acknowledgement by the Minister that the process he has set out is flawed. An independent commission of inquiry is needed to get to the truth and members of the public will not settle for anything less. The Fianna Fáil Party will oppose the whitewash the Minister has proposed. I will now address the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, which comes within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Five Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts have been passed since 2009. Pay and pensions across the public service have been reduced by 14% and public service numbers have declined by 10% in the same period. These pay cuts and job losses were mirrored in the private sector and no household was immune from their effects. It is welcome that the economy is improving as a result of the hard work of Irish people. The assumptions underlying the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts no longer hold. Financial resources permitting, the legislation must be undone, rolled back and removed from the Statute Book in an orderly manner. The Minister and I are almost singing from the same hymn sheet on this matter. He can no longer justify the legislation and will be praying that nobody challenges it. However, given that the basis on which the legislation was introduced no longer exists, it should be wound down in an orderly manner. Pay talks must commence in the public service with a view to increasing pay. The process has already commenced in the private sector and is ongoing. The priority in the first instance must be to look after those who are on low and middle incomes. It is better to have improvements in pay work their way up the economy than to take a trickle-down approach, as the Government has done since it started to address the issue last year when it cut taxes for those on the highest rate. Improvements in public sector pay should concentrate on net take home pay. This means incomes can be improved by increasing pay rates and reducing the universal social charge, PAYE and PRSI rates and pension levies. Retired public servants who are in receipt of pensions must also be involved in any discussions this summer. The pay talks must also be transparent because taxpayers in the public and private sectors will want any changes to be in their interests and independently verified. This was not the case in respect of the Haddington Road agreement.  A third issue has been sadly absent from the Ministers' contributions. One Minister wants tax reductions, while the other wants pay increases. The issue of public services cannot be ignored in this debate. The growth in the economy must lead to improvements in the public services on which every family relies. The pupil-teacher ratio must be improved, for example. The Minister referred to the recruitment of new teachers. The purpose of the increase in teacher numbers is to respond to the increase in student numbers, rather than improve the pupil-teacher ratio. We must ensure that hundreds of thousands of children are not taught in overcrowded classrooms. Career guidance and resource teaching must also be restored. As Deputy Michael McGrath noted, it is unacceptable that 400,000 people are waiting for outpatient appointments in the health service. Elderly and sick people are waiting for fair deal applications to be improved, waiting times for operations have increased and queues in accident and emergency departments are larger than ever. In addition, mental health and suicide prevention measures are not being funded adequately.  In recent years, the Government has completely neglected people who are seeking housing. Its inaction in this area has resulted in an increase in homelessness and housing waiting lists. Rent supplement rates must be increased to assist in this area. The problem is being exacerbated by the Government. The mix between taxation and expenditure measures it has adopted in the past four years demonstrates that its principal effort each year has been to cut front-line services first.  In response to each Government budget, the Fianna Fáil Party has argued that the adjustment should be balanced 50:50 between taxation and expenditure measures. We are pleased the Ministers opposite have come to see the merit of the approach we have advocated for the past four years and are now moving in our direction. Every family benefits from public services and requires improvements in essential front-line services. We must all contribute to such improvements. We cannot allow the debate to be reduced to a simple trade-off between improvements in public services and improvements in public sector pay.  The Minister spoke about demographic challenges, noting that the health service will require an additional €200 million per annum and an additional €200 million will be required to pay the pensions bill because people are living longer. He also referred to the need to recruit an additional 3,500 teachers to accommodate the increasing population. As such, demographic changes mean he will need €600 million of the €700 million available to him just to stand still. People want improvements in services. They do not want the vast majority of the money available used to address demographic changes, with all remaining moneys used to reduce taxes. Front-line services need to be improved. I read something interesting in the document provided. The first item of chapter 7, which deals with policy and strategy, is public service pensions. New entrants to the public service join a new pension scheme that is based on career averages. This new scheme will not have a significant effect for another 40 years. The second issue referred to in the chapter is the abolition of the State transition pension. This measure will mean people will have to sign on for jobseeker's allowance for one year when they reach 65 years. It will not deliver savings but it will hit older people.The next item in the policy statement is long-term care with the Government wanting to revisit the sustainability of the fair deal scheme. Every policy to secure long-term economic sustainability the Ministers have mentioned is actually an attack on the elderly. The Ministers said everything today except the truth. Retired public servants in the years to come will have reduced pensions, the Government has cut the transition pension and now it wants to re-examine the fair deal scheme. Every policy proposal in this document is an attack on the elderly. I am amazed the Government did that today. I would have liked to see a more equitable approach to what the Government is proposing. However, these are the Minister’s proposals and I am shocked he has done this to the elderly. Maybe he feels they should pay more. I actually think he is penalising them for living longer. That is the underlying theme to this. Health, pensions and the fair deal scheme are costing more because people are living longer. The Minister is begrudging people their good health in their retirement. Everything proposed here is a hit for the elderly. While reductions in capital expenditure need to be reversed, it also needs to be done on a regional basis, not just within the M50. The Minister for Finance did not refer to the sale of State assets. He spoke briefly about the sale of the Government’s shares in Permanent TSB. We know Fine Gael is gung-ho to sell the State’s shares in Aer Lingus. I am sure the Minister had to compromise on that to get his 50-50 arrangement for budget day activities. The Government also has shares to sell in AIB and Bank of Ireland. For years, when in opposition, the two Ministers opposite gave out about the money going into the banks. Today, they have changed their language, talking about investment in our banks. How the wheel has turned. When Fianna Fáil was putting the money into the banks, the Ministers opposite called it a bailout, a waste of money and a black hole.

Obviously, the Government’s spin doctors went into hypermode trying to set the public up for what would be a great new dawn heralded by this Government after four years of austerity. We have had selective leaks from Ministers and this was to be the opening salvo of the Government’s election campaign. Fianna Fáil used to start elections with the phrase, “It is showtime”; the Fine Gael-Labour Government starts with the spring statement. What a damp squib it has turned out to be. It does not take a bloodhound to smell an election in the air in Leinster House. What we have seen in this statement is the nod-and-wink promises and actions that will mean nothing to the majority of people for many months to come, if they materialise at all. Today should have been about serious debate about the budget parameters and the options available to meet the needs of our society.

In the past, we would have had the publication of the update for the stability programme which was then scrutinised by the finance committee, looking at the macroprojections and risks in all of the pages that we do not have time to read here today. Instead, the Government went with an election salvo, trying to suggest to the people that the bad old days are behind them and that Fine Gael-Labour are reformed parties that now care about the elderly, the sick, the vulnerable. It is asking the people to forget about all the cuts to child benefit, young people’s social welfare benefits and the imposition of the austerity unleashed by it over the past four years. The people are cute, however, and have learned many lessons over the past several years under this and the previous Governments. They know about false promises. They also know when an election is in the air and how political parties in government deal with the electorate. Once again all talk of political reform is out of the window. Today is the first chapter in budget 2016. Unfortunately, the next chapter will be after the decisions the Government will announce in October. This Government is not genuine when it comes to political reform. The facts show this Government is unfair and regressive. It was unfair in recession and will be even more unfair in the recovery. We know this because we have lived under four years of this Government and have seen what it has done with resources available to the State in the last budget. The ESRI independently stated the impact of budget 2015 meant the 40% wealthiest in society benefited. The more one had, the more one got from the Government, while the 60% of others were left behind and actually lost out. The less one had, the more one lost out. The Ministers opposite can shake their heads until the cows come home but that is what the ESRI stated.

I have only started and, again, they are bickering, sniping and all the rest because the truth is sometimes hard to swallow. I understand their big day is not going down as well as it was planned in the strategy rooms of Labour and Fine Gael. The truth is that the Government has shifted the tax burden on to low and middle-income families, families who are struggling. Sinn Féin has a positive vision for this society and economy. We would get rid of bad and unfair austerity taxes like water charges and the family home tax. The most radical action we would take is to keep our promises. Nobody likes paying tax but we are not afraid of saying that those who can should pay some more. We think it is right to tax those individuals earning over €100,000, particularly when the top 1% owns 12% of the wealth of the State. We also think promising a tax cut and a pay rise for the Taoiseach and other politicians on the same day that 368 people are lying on trolleys in our hospitals is wrong. The whole set-up today is based on dishonesty. The dishonest notion this Government has a mandate is the principle one. It has long since lost the trust of the people. The other great dishonesty of the day is the notion that austerity worked. The third one is that we all made sacrifices. Let us be original and actually examine the facts. Let us judge it by the Government’s own predictions on coming to power. It has met none of the claims it made for itself on coming to office. In the stability programme update in April 2011, it stated the economy would grow by 8.7% from 2012 to 2014. In fact, the total growth over that time has been little more than half of that at 4.7%. This is because the Government’ policies slowed the economy and even caused a double-dip recession. Personal spending is still 7% below where it was at the beginning of 2008. It has not even recovered to the point it was at when Fine Gael and Labour took office in 2011. Austerity has failed. Maybe not for all the friends of Fine Gael, including big donors in the past, as we have seen recently, but for the vast majority of people austerity has been a nightmare and a useless waste of years. We have seen falling incomes for most families. Many people in work find themselves poorer. Household incomes fell after this Government took office. Benefits have been cut - everything from support for single parents to respite care for carers. Austerity has ravaged our public services and has hollowed out public investment. Nearly all of our public services and public investment have been cut. GDP growth has only benefited a few so far. This is because both Government policy and the recovery are only for the few. GDP growth, such as it is, is not being shared around, it is passing most people by. It is a one-sided recovery, benefiting only some parts and some people. Seven years after the economy reached a peak, it was still, at the end of 2014, more than 3% below that level. The economy is only convalescing and has not fully recovered. For most people it has not even got that far. This is the truth behind the Government’s talk of recovery for the last number of years. The truth is that every downturn ends and every recession bottoms out. The question is did the Government policies of the time deepen, lengthen and inflict pain on citizens that they could have done without? The answer is clear from the facts. The Government caused a double-dip recession after it took office in 2011 and prolonged the crisis. The Government said the recovery is fair, but the growth in GDP is almost entirely from the overseas sector, net exports or net financial flows from overseas.

I am not saying all of it, but much of it has little to do with the real economy in Ireland. The CSO has been talking about contract manufacturing which bumped up GDP growth in 2014. I am sure the Minister will not deny those facts. Austerity began under Fianna Fáil at the beginning of 2010. They were the architects. At that time, total general government quarterly expenditure was €29.2 billion in Q1 of 2010. By Q4 of 2014, however, it had fallen to €19.6 billion, a fall of nearly €10 billion. All of this and more is accounted for by an €11.3 billion fall in capital transfers at the same time. This is just stopping more bailout money going to the banks. That is why expenditure decreased. All the rest of the cuts, which were severe, did not add up to the savings, just as we warned. This is because cuts are not savings. They lead to slower growth and increased poverty, which puts pressure on different areas of Government spending. In days to come we will no doubt hear about the Government’s commitment to investment but this is guff from a Government whose sole area of expenditure that it did manage to cut was investment. In 2010, under the Fianna Fáil-led Government, public investment was cut to €5.6 billion, but the current Government went further. By 2014, Fine Gael and Labour had slashed public investment to just €3.5 billion. They still have no investment plan, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, recently confirmed to me. Does anyone seriously suggest that cutting investment is the road to recovery? Ireland does not have too many flood defence systems, too many great public health facilities or too many ultra-modern schools. We will all pay in the long run for this fiscal vandalism, dressed up as fiscal rectitude. Of course, the Government parties and Fianna Fáil see no problem with this. That is because their policies represent the interests of the few, not of the many. All the austerity parties claim there is no alternative to austerity. They always claimed that, but they have been proved wrong. Sinn Féin has consistently argued that there is an alternative to these policies. Today we heard that action will be taken on mortgage arrears and interest rates. Is this from the same Government that must have quoted a thousand times by now that there is a memorandum of understanding and that it cannot interfere with the banks? Is this from the same Government that voted down my Bill to protect the family home, which could have gone some way towards preventing the tsunami of repossession proceedings? Is this from the same Government that allowed the mortgage crisis to double in the first two years of its term? We hear the Government is going to lay down the line with the banks on interest rates. Are we supposed to take this seriously? How many times have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance told us they were powerless? How many times have we - not for months, but for years - asked the Minister to call in the banks concerning unsustainable mortgage debt and variable interest rates? Yet we will have action now, as there is the smell of an election in the air. As a republican party, we stand for equality. The burden of the crisis should have fallen on those who caused it and could afford to bear it. We know this Government waited barely weeks before throwing out its promise to burn the bondholders. It caved in, just like Fianna Fáil before, to the ECB and not for the last time. Let us be clear that Sinn Féin’s way is definitely not Frankfurt’s way. Sinn Féin has a vision whereby banks owned by the people are not facilitated in evicting families and are not allowed to dictate government policy. Under Fine Gael and Labour, the banks own the people. Sinn Féin would say “No way” to banks that are trying to rip off homeowners and evict them in order to fatten up their own accounts. The recovery could be broad-based and could benefit everyone. If policies are changed, it still can be fair and can be broad-based. We can build a country that works for all of its citizens. We have an alternative. We have said that all priorities in the past should have been different. We have called for investment in our future and protection for the hardest hit. The policy of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour was that no bondholders would be left behind. Even now, KPMG is preparing to pay out, on behalf of the people, hundreds of millions of euro to junior bondholders and vultures at IBRC. That is the legacy of this Government's banking policy. A recovery should mean more gardaí in Garda stations, more nurses in our hospitals, and more teachers for our children. Not teachers on JobBridge schemes, but young teachers who are paid. The improvement in the Government's finances should be used to support a real recovery. It should be a recovery that benefits the majority, not a giveaway that benefits those who are best off. We need to invest in our shared future. Building affordable homes is an acute necessity in many areas. It creates decent, well paid jobs and new homes generate income for the Government that can be used for reinvestment purposes. Today's debate is really about a Government trying to get re-elected by promising the moon and stars in its nod-and-wink fashion, having stolen the shirt off people’s backs. The Fianna Fáil Party is trying out a new policy because the Government stole its old ones. It should be about laying out a vision of a sustainable and fair recovery as we approach the centenary of the Rising. That is the debate Sinn Féin wants and is ready for. We challenge the logic that the way to create jobs is to cut taxes. Any investment creates jobs. Investment in the real economy creates sustainable jobs. The Minister estimates that a fiscal giveaway of €1.2 billion to €1.5 billion for four years would create 20,000 jobs. This is between €4.8 billion and €6 billion in total. These must be some of the highest paid jobs in the world. It would be far better to invest in creating high quality jobs in the real economy. We heard today that the marginal tax rate must come down to attract our young emigrants back home. Is this a joke? Does the Government think that 80,000 people are leaving this State every year because the marginal tax rate was too high? Is this what the trauma of emigration has been reduced to? What we have heard today is tax-cutting McCreevy-style, but with less logic and delivered in a Limerick accent. It is a reckless hollowing of our tax base just as we begin to grow. It is a poke in the eye for anybody who believes in a strong, sustainable economic model based on more than certain industries doing well. Fine Gael and Labour are Fianna Fáil in reverse. Let me explain that. First, they gave us austerity which damaged the economy, kicking it when it was down. Then they stoked up property prices in Dublin and other parts of the country, and now they have moved on to dangling tax cuts.That is exactly what Fianna Fáil did but just in reverse. It is an attempt to bribe the people with their own money but it repeats all of the stupid mistakes of the previous Government.  Let us be clear. We need better schools, better roads, more affordable homes and affordable child care. We need to invest in the economy so that our children have a better future than we did. That is Sinn Féin's pledge. Instead, we are promised tax cuts and if we are to base them on budget 2015, as the Minister said, we know that they will benefit the better off. This Government is making the same errors Fianna Fáil made. It is a return to boom and bust but this boom will pass most people by, and tax cuts which mainly benefit the better off will not provide the homes, the schools, the bus services and the child care we need. The Government's tax policy has moved the burden from those who can afford to pay it onto the shoulders of those who cannot afford to pay any more. That is the opposite of what is needed. The record of this Government shows that its tax cuts always mainly benefit the rich more than anybody else. It is not interested in our children's future. For it, long-term economic management is getting as far as the next election because it will not be around when the next generation is suffering the consequences of its decisions. Now that the public finances show €1.5 billion available for reinvestment it acts like a drunken sailor on leave. It is burning a hole in its pocket, but it belongs to the people of Ireland. It could be used to benefit the whole of society. At least the priority should be to protect the poorest and to ensure that low and middle income earners get something back, but the Government's tax measures will do nothing of the kind. If someone is on €500 a week or €5,000 a week and the marginal rate is cut by 1%, guess who is better off? The Ministers say they are helping the middle earners but the reality is that their policies always end up benefiting the richest the most. If any of that sounds familiar it is because it is familiar. It is the policies of Fianna Fáil dressed up as something different. It is tax cuts for the better off, too little investment and stoking up a property boom that passes most people by, and we know what happens next - a bust. This is the politics of failure. It is boom and bust: the sequel.  However, there is an alternative, and Sinn Féin is the party that wants to lead the entire nation to a better society. Our pledge is to protect the poorest, the most disadvantaged and those whose aim is to get a better life for themselves and their loved ones. These people will never benefit from rising prices in penthouse apartments. We also pledge to use the improvements in Government finances to build for the future, and to build a fair recovery now, but that means investing in our future, not tax cutting our way to another boom and bust as Fine Gael and Labour propose. There is an alternative to these policies. We have argued that fairness is the key. This is not a fair recovery, as we have seen today. The Government and Fianna Fáil do not believe in fairness. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. They believe in congratulating themselves for failure dressed up as success. People have been sacrificed rather than having made sacrifices but we will put money back into people's pockets the fair way by scrapping water charges, ending the family home tax and removing those on the minimum wage from the universal social charge, USC, tax net. Politics is about choices. The choice now is whether to invest in public services so that our young people, those with disabilities and others have the same rights as others, our older people have the right to a bed and not a hospital trolley, those on the housing waiting list have a right to a house, and those in mortgage distress have a right to live in their homes. That is the option the Ministers opposite have, or they can choose their option of tax cuts because an election is coming. Sinn Féin is committed to the former. We are committed to hiring more nurses, more midwives, more resource teachers and more special needs assistants immediately. That is the choice we would make. A fair recovery is possible. We can invest in the future. We can have a fair recovery. We can build an Ireland for all its citizens but, unfortunately, that is not possible under Fine Gael and Labour. They were unfair in the recession and their plan for the recovery is unfair because they do not have it in them. They do not understand the word and the reason I know that is because we, and the Irish people, have lived under four years of their unfairness and austerity.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	203	Today's spring economic statement was billed, among much fanfare, as a roadmap to the great recovery, drawing a line under this Government's devastating cutbacks and austerity and marking an end to what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, describes as the lost decade. They are grandiose claims that have amounted to nothing. There is nothing new whatsoever in them - no change in thinking or direction, no real commitment to rebuild society and the economy in the aftermath of catastrophic hardship for so many people, and no real understanding of where things are at for hundreds of thousands of families and workers who are really struggling and are at their wits' end. Listening to both Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, brings to mind the great Irish writer Jonathan Swift, who once observed that blessed are those who expect nothing for they shall never be disappointed. Bravo to that. It just goes to show one today. Most people were not taken in by the Ministers' hype, certainly not the people I represent, but for those who were perhaps gullible enough to believe the Government guff of recent weeks about increasing people's standard of living and bringing relief to low and middle income families, that bubble has been well and truly burst here this afternoon. Today, the Ministers have clarified again the position of this Fine Gael and Labour Government. It is progress for those at the top and patronising tokenism for the rest. I am sure people were relieved to learn that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is greatly encouraged by the data flow over the past year or so. I would think people were very concerned to hear him assert that the recovery is, to his mind, broadly based. I do not know the circles in which the Minister mixes. I do not know the people he talks to in the course of his political duties but I want to tell him, unequivocally, that a recovery has not reached the homes, the livelihood or the pockets of countless thousands of people across this State. If he has a difficulty in believing that he is more than welcome to visit the north inner city of Dublin or my home neighbourhood of Cabra where he will meet no end of people who will him that very directly. Where is the big initiative, the game changer, for the low paid or for the squeezed middle about whom the Minister claims to be so concerned? Having starved public services of funding and staff, taxed working people into poverty, driven hundreds of thousands of our best and brightest to emigration and stood idly by in the face of homelessness, mortgage distress and eviction orders he comes in here today looking for brownie points. As he now limbers up for a tilt at re-election, for what is he hoping? A pat on the back or an expression of gratitude perhaps from the very people who have borne the brunt of his failed Government? Today’s rhetoric from the Ministers is very familiar. There is a real sense of déjà vu. They have the neck to rehearse again the same tired rhetoric that marked their 2011 election campaign. They replayed the charade that they care about fairness or a decent society as the Minister, Deputy Howlin, loftily announces to the Chamber that an economy is not society, and vice versa. They used this Dáil Chamber to spell out again their empty, meaningless promises but, after all, that is what Labour and Fine Gael do in elections. Do they imagine for a second that people cannot see through them? They are fooling no one but themselves. It is fitting that the backdrop to today’s statement is the ongoing controversy surrounding Siteserv and other IBRC transactions.As the Government crows about its great reforms and introduces a new concept of national economic dialogue, we are faced again with depressingly familiar questions around the insiders of Irish society. The Ministers opposite know who I mean - the people in the know; what I call "the entitled classes".

The refusal by the Minister for Finance to have the very serious issues surrounding Siteserv and all IBRC transactions, including NAMA transactions, independently investigated by a commission of investigation makes nonsense of any claims he makes to political reform. The truth is that he has no interest in reform. He is committed to the status quo and to business as usual. Labour and Fine Gael are parties entrenched in defence of the status quo. That is why for the past four years they have implemented Fianna Fáil style punishment on working people. That is why they absolutely refuse to confront the rampant cronyism that still plagues our political system. If the Government believes it is a reforming one, it is deluded. Over the last four years, the Government has reinforced the strongly held view across society that there are two classes of citizens, the insiders and the rest. There are the ones who are to be protected and enriched and the rest; the haves and the have nots. It is hardly the stuff of the democratic revolution the Government promised. Today was the Government's opportunity to spell out and commit to a fair recovery. It should have abolished water charges. It should have abolished the tax on the family home. It did neither. It missed the chance to put €800 million back into the pockets of families to give real and immediate relief to low and middle income people across the country. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, may throw his eyes to heaven, but that is the reality.

This is the Government's policy in action. Meanwhile and without regard to ability to pay, citizens are to be charged for their water, which is a basic human necessity and right. This is the Government's policy in action. There are 110,366 households in mortgage distress and at any given time an average 5,000 people and families are homeless. As at January 2015, over 7,000 civil bills for repossession have been lodged in the 26 circuit courts across the State and we are told that repossessions could reach as high as 25,000 this year. This is all on the watch of Fine Gael and Labour and it is their policy in action.

What makes it worse is that the parties almost wear it as a badge of honour. People's inability to pay these taxes is trumped only by the Government's inability to listen and a more fundamental inability or unwillingness to understand the realities of people's lives. We are in the grip of a housing crisis, but one would certainly not guess it from the spring economic statement. We have no real indication of the Government getting to grips with the huge levels of homelessness, housing waiting lists and mortgage distress. We have no promise of rent controls and no real measures to bring the banks to heel to ensure that struggling mortgage holders will not lose the roofs over their heads. It is not sufficient to say that the Minister for Finance will call in the bankers for a chat. None of us believes it would be anything more than a chat with those individuals. Four years into government, Fine Gael and Labour have spectacularly failed to assert the interests of citizens against the banks that those same citizens bailed out. The veto contained in the legislation of 2012 must be removed. Why did the Minister for Finance not make a commitment today to revisit that legislation and balance the relationship between mortgage holders and bankers? The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made one reference to health and it seemed to be a statement that indicates more of the same. There is a holding position in respect of health. One would never guess that our health services were stretched and under pressure. With the shortage of hospital staff and the crisis in accident and emergency, there are currently 405,000 people on waiting lists to be seen in outpatient clinics. The Government has failed to make headway in reducing waiting lists and waiting times. January 2015 saw record numbers of people on trolleys in our hospitals, standing at one stage at over 600 for the first time. Despite promises to end the scandal of patients on trolleys, there is no sign of this problem being resolved. On the Government's watch, our public health system's workforce has shrunk by 11,000 whole time equivalent staff. According to Dr. Stephen Thomas of TCD's Centre of Health Policy and Management, the State had seen the "biggest proportionate drop in healthcare across Europe". He says we have lost almost 20% of our funding and 11% to 12% of staff. What is the Government's response and what indications do we glean from today's statement? It is precious little bar a muted response. There is a commitment, if one can classify it as such, to do no more than continue what has gone before. It is disappointing and worrying. There was no reference to prescription charges and one would never imagine there was an issue with them. Do the Ministers remember promising to abolish prescription charges for medical card holders? Far from being abolished, the charges increased from 50 cent per item to a staggering €2.50 per item, which hurt the poorest and sickest of our citizens and caused real hardship for senior citizens in particular. The gentlemen opposite may smirk, but these are the issues and measures against which citizens will judge whether or not there is a recovery in the air and whether they are to be invited to the table to participate in it. It would have matched the gentlemen better rather than smirking at me to have given some consideration to that fact and to the expectation they created through the media among the general public that today we would hear and establish what the Government's version of the recovery might look like. There was nothing of any great import said by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on education. Our primary school classrooms are among the most overcrowded in the EU. More than 125,000 pupils are in classes of 30 or more, which is a very large class size.The Minister's cuts in special education and the utterly disgraceful 15% cut to resource teaching hours for children with special needs - does the Minister remember that cut? - have really damaged the educational opportunities for so many of our young children.

If the Minister was committed to a real and fair recovery, that is precisely what he would have done. He might also have indicated the reinstatement of dedicated supports for Traveller children and non-English speaking children. Does the Minister remember that he abolished those supports in their entirety? The Government broke the Labour Party promises to third level students not to increase fees. In addition, the capitation grants for third level students and those in further education were cut. The big claim of this Government, and the Minister, Deputy Howlin, repeated it again today, is that it protected social welfare entitlements. That is simply not true. Child benefit was cut. Young people’s jobseeker's allowance was cut. The invalidity pension was cut. Most shocking and cruel, the respite care grant was cut by €325. The Government intends to carry on true to form. Come July, in excess of 30,000 single parent families will no longer qualify for one-parent family payments. These families will experience a real cut in their living income. The Tánaiste, who introduced these cuts, promised that no change for single parents would come into place until such time as "safe, affordable and accessible child care is in place, similar to what is found in the Scandinavian countries". She went further, pledging,"If this is not forthcoming, the measure will not proceed." In case the Ministers have not noticed, there is no such child care provision in this State. Yet the Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, is hell bent on introducing this cut anyway. Why has the Government not abolished this measure? Will there be a dividend for single parent families? Are they not worthy of protection? Is the Tánaiste not prepared to keep her word? We have a real crisis in this State as regards low pay. According to the OECD, this State has the second highest levels of low pay, just behind the United States of America. The Government's approach to tackling this epidemic is both timid and limited. The Low Pay Commission is welcome but its remit, as we in Sinn Féin have argued, is far too restrictive. A Government with a plan for a fair and real recovery would task this commission with dealing with low pay in all its dimensions. It would task the commission with moving in a planned way to establishing a living wage at a decent threshold for all workers. Instead the Government has limited and restricted its terms of consideration to the minimum wage, which is a big mistake and which sums up the Government's minimalist view of what low income families and workers, in particular, can expect or are due in its grand new era of economic recovery. There has been a lot of speculation about the restoration of public sector pay and the "unwinding", as the Minister terms it, of the emergency FEMPI legislation. Workers in the public sector have taken a substantial hit in their income and there is no doubt that many of them are in real hardship. It is wrong to imagine that all public servants or civil servants are in overpaid, cushy numbers. That is far from the truth. It is equally true to say that there are some in the upper echelons of the public and civil service who have traditionally been overpaid. The crucial point about reinstating public pay and people's take home pay is that we must start at the bottom. We must start with those workers, some of whom receive family income supplement because they exist on poverty wages. These are State employees and yet they are so badly paid. The Minister has previously indicated that he envisages such pay increases in percentage terms. I suggest that this might not be the most effective way to target the reliefs and benefits at the lowest paid. What would certainly be totally unacceptable is any suggestion that the high paid, dare I say overpaid, minority at the top should receive any pay increase. I include in that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers, Deputies and Senators. There can be no question of pay increases for elected officials while the Government persists with its agenda of cuts and while we still have the utterly scandalous level of poverty wages in the public and private sectors.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, made some pretty outlandish commitments on job creation when he spoke earlier. He committed to pass the 2 million people in employment mark next year and to replace all of the jobs lost during the downturn by 2018. He is making the assumption that the Government will be in office to do so. In total, between 2015 and 2020, the Minister committed to adding 200,000 new jobs. That does not tally with this Government's record to date. Some 69,300 net new jobs have been created over the past four years. Some 26,900 of these were created in 2014. Bearing in mind those figures, Fine Gael and the Labour Party would have to improve its record in job creation annually by 50% to meet those targets as announced. On the basis of their previous track record, that does not look hopeful. I am also disappointed to see a marked lack of ambition in respect of job creation via the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. Their results have not been spectacular; rather, they have been extremely underwhelming. For a Government that states repeatedly that it puts work and the opportunity to work at the heart of its agenda and the recovery, this is most alarming.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	238	I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for making that point. It is one we make during every budget and the situation is very insulting. I accept some of the things which were said in the spring statement. I accept that there is growth in the economy, and that is welcome. I accept that there are more people at work, and that is very welcome, but I question the quality of some of those jobs, including some of the public service jobs.We all want to have hope for the future, but the economy has been stabilised at the expense of society. The elephant in the room is the debt. That we are servicing a debt that is the equivalent of the entire education system is delaying the prospect of a recovery, one that is not just of the economy, but of our society. By "at the expense of society", I mean that various groups have been targeted in recent years: carers, students, lone parents in particular and some medical card holders. We have a new class of homelessness. This is damaging. Everyone has been hit. The universal social charge, USC, which was introduced under the previous Government, the property tax and water charges have hit people's pockets. Equally damaging is the fact that we have failed to seize the once-in-a-generation opportunity to change fundamentally how we govern ourselves. In much of the public service reform, "reform" became code for "cuts". Our political reform was only superficial. We must be ambitious about what kind of society we want for the future. We are a great country, but we are not great because of our politics or institutions. We are great because of the people and despite some of those institutions. We must change that situation and transform this country. There is a desire for this type of transformation. The longer term vision requires us to grasp some issues that have not been adequately addressed. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, referred to not considering the economy in isolation, but in the wider global context. This is why I sought a debt conference. It is necessary. Consider the levels of debt in Italy, France, Belgium and even Germany. We need a fiscal expansion into key areas if we are to build a better country and society. We need to take a longer term approach, one that cannot be about an electoral cycle. We need to see investment in, for example, retrofitting homes if we are to escape paying large amounts of hard cash under our climate change obligations. There must be investment in public transport and cities and towns must function in a way that is not wasteful of time and energy. Compared with many western European countries, some of which are our competitors, we are still in the ha'penny place in terms of broadband. This impacts on the economy. We must invest in water, but what has happened to date has been wasteful. For example, there is a 25% leakage rate in Kildare. Using an educated guess, the centre of Dublin, Cork or possibly Limerick is where one will find leaks. One does not need meters to know this. One needs to find out how old the pipes are and put meters on either end of them. The Government did not go about this in a way that would get to the core of the problem. I have often acknowledged that the Government inherited many of these problems, but we are not challenging the consensus among the big guys. We are seeing it again and again. That the big guys are being dealt with differently than people with mortgages or indebted small companies that are being chased around by banks is getting to people. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated that what happened must never happen again and that the Government could not get back the €34 billion put into Anglo Irish Bank, but the Government did not ask for it. It is criminal that people are still paying for it. It is as if we took on the mortgage of the big house up the road, subsequently restructured it and were singing the restructuring's praises because we no longer had to pay as much as we believed we would. This is the spin, but we are still paying every penny of it as well as the interest. In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me: "The schedule for extinguishing the balance will be €500 million in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018." On 23 December, the first €500 million was borrowed and burned. He continued: "That will rise to €1 billion in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. It will double again to €2 billion" per year from 2024 onwards until it is paid, which looks to be in 2034. I am coming to a point about the relationship between this and that awful night when we turned the IOU into a sovereign bond. We have no way of knowing what the relationship was between IBRC and the Department of Finance on that night. In the Chamber, the Minister talked in glowing terms about IBRC's board and chief executive and IBRC was only being wound down so quickly for one reason. However, we were not told what the relationship was. This issue needs to be addressed in the House. Why was there a sudden urgency to liquidate IBRC? Was there even a relationship? Not even the senior management knew. Remember how Mr. Alan Dukes was told that afternoon; we saw it on Twitter. The question of the relationship is important. Many issues like that arise. According to Mr. John Moran's diary, he met Mr. Mike Aynsley on 1 and 2 August, but there are no notes from that high level meeting. How could it be that two days of meetings were held between the most senior people in the Department of Finance and IBRC and not even one note was kept? Turning again to the big guys as opposed to the small guys, Mr. Denis O'Brien owed IBRC millions of euro. If he had a spare €45 million lying around, why was he not asked to use it to pay down his borrowings instead of using it to purchase a company that we have been told was a bit of a basket case? Why would the bank allow someone in such debt to use €45 million to expose himself further or did he know that Siteserv would quickly turn into something profitable? The inquiry by KPMG relates to this debate. If we are to have hope for the future, we need to do things differently in terms of governance. We cannot ask the same people who were part of a deal to review that deal. It will not wash. The public knows this. I took great offence when the Taoiseach yesterday spoke about the accuracy of some of my questions and how they were written. It was beneath him and his office. He should correct that statement. There was nothing wrong with the questions I posed. What was wrong was that I was not getting answers. They had to be pulled out like hens' teeth. This is unacceptable. I am concerned by section 31(2)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act 2014. Under it, where a member of the Judiciary is involved in a review or inquiry, freedom of information requests are out of bounds.It is important that this issue is not just pushed off into the future and buried until 31 August, right bang in the middle of the silly season. I am very hopeful about this country. The claim has been made on many occasions from the Government benches that those of us on this side of the House show no evidence of having hope. In fact, we do have hope, but we may well have a different vision for the type of Ireland we want to create. This is an opportunity to acknowledge that we should not dismiss things that are positive. Indeed, both of the Ministers, Deputies Richard Bruton and Simon Coveney, who are in the Chamber have been very much at the heart of driving some of the positive improvement we have seen. It is only fair that we acknowledge that. However, we should not be codding ourselves about any of the issues or tolerating spin; our discussions must be real. The Government would do well to remember that the public is wide awake and engaged with all of this.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	239	I thank the Government for introducing me to a brand new emotion, which is a kind of combination of, on the one hand, being incredibly underwhelmed and, at the same time, offended by the fanfare that is scheduled for this week. That fanfare displays an arrogance that is becoming increasingly a hallmark of this Government. While it has scheduled yet another backslappers' convention for us to have to endure, real issues that were touched on this morning, such as the scandal of Siteserv, goings-on at IBRC, the contract for installing water meters, the list of private bodies benefiting from those contracts and the whole Irish Water diaspora debacle, are ignored. It is head-spinning stuff. All the big names are there, including KPMG, Arthur Cox, the Davy Group, Ernst & Young, Denis O'Brien and the usual roll-out of consultants, advisers and middle men. We are not being given a chance to discuss any of that. Even the Government's own backbenchers are embarrassed by what is happening today. In fact, none of them has been present for the jamboree. It seems even they are a bit scarlet to have to sit through it. This whole thing really exposes how utterly out of touch the Government is with the real lives of citizens. I will bring Ministers back to earth by reading a letter I received last weekend from a person in Cavan. He wrote:Hi Clare,Just to keep you up to touch with things, I'm starting back to work again after three years of really tough times. I have spent €6,000 of my own money trying to retrain and get back to work. I received no assistance from the system. Absolutely soul-destroying stuff. Three weeks ago I became a member of a very special group, the group that comes under the title of ghosters. Now, the ghosters are the group of citizens that have reached the point where the welfare system says "No more, your wife is working, so you don't qualify for any payment at all." For the first time in 43 years, I had no income whatsoever. That's a situation I never, ever want to be in again, nor did I in the first place. The sense of embarrassment, shame and complete loss of self-esteem is indescribable. I never thought, even after being made redundant three years ago, that I'd be out for so long. I really believed that I'd be back at work in a couple of months at most, but that wasn't to be. The rest, as they say, is history. Two weeks ago, I was standing on a bridge here in Ballyconnell looking into a very fast-flowing river and deciding if I'd end it. Two things prevented that from happening. Number one, I looked in and I asked who'd feed my dog. Number two, I want to see Enda Kenny and co. get their comeuppance. In fact, I want to play my part in it. My vote counts. I count, somewhere in the overall picture of things. Now isn't that scary? But the real scary thing is that there are thousands more like me. They need help, real help, not just a lip service from some pompous git in a suit, shirt and tie telling them that we are in recovery. Recovery for whom? The Denis O'Briens of this world? Greed-motivated buggers who care only for the quick buck at everybody's expense?This citizen has made a more articulate contribution than anything I have heard from the Government benches today, and how right he is about the type of Ireland the Government is standing over. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, had the brass neck to come in here today and allude to vague efforts that will allow us to build a society that reflects our values, one that is fair, caring and decent. He talked about how a functioning society is a fair one, where the fruits of economic growth are shared among all the people. He is certainly right there, but let us use this as the yardstick against which the Government's achievements may be measured. Look at the type of society it is building. The Sunday Times rich list published at the weekend claims Ireland is home to 13 billionaires with an accumulated wealth of €38 billion. The wealthiest 250 people have a total net wealth of €75 billion, a wealth on which the Government does not charge a cent of extra taxation. The myth Ministers are putting out there, that we have all put our shoulders to the wheel and brazened out this austerity bravely together is nothing but an utter fallacy. It is absolutely not true. The Government has seized on the economic crisis to stand over a counter revolution, a transfer of wealth from ordinary people and those in the middle to those at the top. The statistics prove it, with a wealth increase to that top group of almost 16%. These are people like Denis O'Brien, the Weston family, who own Penneys and Brown Thomas, the Dunnes family, renowned for its great labour practices, and so on and so forth. The country's wealthiest people are immensely more wealthy thanks to the governance of this Administration. All I can say to that is, "Good job, Fine Gael". The people it has prioritised are generally the people who vote for the party. It has looked after its own. However, the charlatans in the Labour Party, none of whom could even be bothered to sit in this Chamber today - perhaps the embarrassment has got to them - are an entirely different matter. They have facilitated a race to the bottom, where the idea of a secure, permanent and pensionable job is a fallacy for most people. The doctors, nurses and gardaí who though they were part of the middle classes are in jobs with a starting rate of €24,000. If they marry one of their colleagues, they will not be able to buy a house in today's market and probably will not afford to rent one. Half the population is on an income of less than €27,000. The question we should be asking is not whether we can patch this up a little bit and throw a few extra bob back at the wealthy but, rather, what type of society do we really want to live in. Going by the vague nothingness that was dished up the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, today, the answer the Government has given to that question is that it pretty much wants things to continue as they are. That is really the height of its vision, and it is a shocking disappointment to citizens. As other Deputies noted, the fabric of our society is unravelling. There are people behind respectable doors who do not have enough money to put food on the table and are worried sick that their children will come home and ask for a few bob for a school tour. There are people becoming homeless who are in employment. There are people in public sector jobs who are getting supplements from the Government. There is a homeless crisis the like of which we never saw, but the Government's responses are actually making the situation worse. When Jonathan Corrie tragically died before Christmas, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, in a knee-jerk reaction, announced that half the houses the local authorities have must be allocated to the homeless. This means that in Fingal, for example, 50% of the houses have to be given to 0.6% of the population on the list. The problem, of course, is that there are no houses there. Staff on the front line are experiencing a massive rise in the number of people who are homeless and they do not have the resources to deal with it. We have a Government that includes the Labour Party which wants to frog-march people into compulsory private health insurance. People have paid PRSI for decades to get access to a health service, but the Government wants to force them into a privatised system. It is absolutely horrendous. I have no doubt that when it comes to October, Ministers will puff out their chests and tell us they are putting more money into the health service. Well, yippie, yuppie and yahooey. Where is that money going? The scandals being exposed inside the HSE are nothing short of scandalous. Care packages for vulnerable adults are costing the State between €450,000 and €500,000 a year from an outsourced provider that is not being regulated by anybody. Let us face it, the Government has done very well by the middle men.All the middle men, through the contracting of all those outsourced companies to deliver public services, are being enriched by the Government at the expense of front-line staff.  We have an education system and if the Government has a few extra bob to play around with, surely to God if it wanted to build a better society it would start with our young people. Surely it would start investing in young people as the hallmark of a better type of world, yet the INTO has been forced to run a campaign to increase the capitation levels in our primary schools. The rate is €8 per capita
vis-à-vis €11 per capita at second level and €16 per capita at third level. That must be reversed. We must deal with the crisis in our classroom sizes if we are serious about educating our young people. I believe that citizens are happy to pay tax, if they get good public services in return, but we should be going after those at the top to get them to pay more. If the corporations even paid the paltry level of corporation tax that we level them with, we would have billions of euro more to seriously invest in proper infrastructural programmes that would deal with our water supply and provide a proper comprehensive transport system that would begin to tackle issues such as climate change, but instead those in government are happy to tinker around the edges, throw a few bob in enough ways in the hope that they will get back in here again so that they can carry on regardless.  People say that those in government have done nothing but I do not agree with that. They have done the nation a great service in one way. They have advanced the political education of our citizens beyond anything every seen before. The citizens voted in their hundreds of thousands for something different. They knew they had been betrayed by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party and they thought that the Government parties would be different, but now they know that is not the case. Those in government have taught them that they cannot rely on the people in here and that the only power they have is that of self-organisation, of taking matters into their own hands and trying to control their own destiny. That is the movement those in government have singlehandedly unleashed through its clumsy and appalling handling of the Irish Water debacle. They have not learned the lessons from that and they will pay a very heavy price for that in the next election which will probably be after their next backslapping exercise in October if they last that long.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	240	I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for pointing out the Government's quite deliberate and studied contempt for the Technical Group but I take heart from the fact that the senior Ministers felt the need to walk out of the Chamber. It brought to mind the motto of a great American journalist of Irish descent, Finlay Peter Dunne, also known as Mr. Dooley, and about whom James Joyce wrote poems, who was a political satirist in the 1930s in the United States. His motto was that our job is "to comfort the afflicted and to afflict the comfortable". When the senior Ministers walked out before we were due to speak it was precisely because they knew we would afflict the comfortable and they did not want to hear it. They do not want to acknowledge the points or give them respect but, to some extent, that, at least, is a testament to the impact of the points and arguments we are making on this side of House. I want to point to one positive aspect of the spring statement. They has been a lot of waffle, as there often is in political and media debate, about the timing of this. I believe a spring statement is quite a good idea. It is quite useful to begin the budget debate early and to set out perspectives in order that we can debate them in the run in to the budget. My problem is not with the timing but with the substance of the spring statement and the rather nauseating tone of self-congratulation and triumphalism that has accompanied it. What we are really witnessing is a barrage of propaganda, aimed at constructing a mirage of economic recovery in the run in to the election that belies the obscene increase in the level of poverty and deprivation in Irish society; the fact that the recovery in employment is based on a further race to the bottom in terms of pay and conditions for tens of thousands of workers in this country; an unprecedented housing and homelessness crisis that is bordering on the catastrophic; a disastrous situation in our public health system; the worst student-staff ratios in education anywhere in the European Union; and a disastrous collapse in investment in some of the key infrastructure that we need to have a genuine and sustainable economy and recovery.  One claim that I find ludicrous, and to which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, referred on a number of occasions in his statement, is that all of this and the policies being pursued and promised by the Government are moving us away from boom-bust economics, which we all want, but, ironically, it is doing exactly the opposite. The Government has singlehandedly and quite incredibly stoked up another property bubble within a few short years of the last property bubble that crashed the economy and beggared the nation. It is quite an achievement that following the previous Government having brought the economy and society to its knees by letting profiteers in property and in the banking industry off the leash and creating a property bubble this Government has managed to start the same process again within a few short years of that economic collapse. That is a remarkable achievement, but it is very frightening and worrying. The Government is putting in place precisely the ingredients that led to the last bubble and to boom-bust economics. It is congratulating itself on handing back the parts of the economy that we were forced to bail out to the very people who caused the crisis in the first place. The banks that we bailed out are now being sold off and handed back. We took all the pain of bailing them out. When we bailed them out we exercised no control whatsoever over what they had done in recent years and as soon as they start to make money again, we will hand them back to the very same people who crashed the economy, recreating the conditions for the collapse. Similarly, we have the Siteserv scandal and what that opens up into, namely, the much bigger scandal of the same process happening in terms of the handing over of the assets of these banks that we bailed out back to the golden circle who helped crash the economy in the first place. It beggars belief. I do not know whether brown envelopes went back and forth or the exact nature of the relationship that led Denis O'Brien to get, between Siteserv, Topaz, the Beacon and Independent Newspapers, €450 million of debt written off by IBRC, Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland. Where was the concern for the moral hazard? When we were asking in 2012 while this was happening if people in unsustainable mortgage arrears could get a write-down to current market levels, the Government said it could not possibly do that because of the moral hazard involved. Where was the concern of the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for the moral hazard involved in giving the richest man in Ireland, Denis O'Brien, €450 million in debt write-downs from these banks that we had bailed out? It is extraordinary, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. We do not know who else got them but we have got hints from Mike Aynsley of the extent of the debt write-downs being handed out to those in the inner circle, the golden circle, the crony circle or whatever it was called, to the insiders and the pals, having regard to whatever was the exact nature of the relationship.It is in stark and dramatic contrast to what was being said and done to ordinary citizens who were in mortgage distress and who were suffering under the vicious impact of cuts to social welfare, the housing budget, to incomes and to services for people with disabilities in 2012. We need to remember what this Government was doing to ordinary people in 2012 when these debts were being written down. I was looking back at my own comments about Siteserv and Denis O'Brien in 2012 and found it almost humorous. The Ceann Comhairle cut across me four times and told me that I was entering into dangerous territory. That is what he said - dangerous territory - and that I should stop talking about it. A few days later I got a letter from Denis O'Brien saying that I was abusing Dáil privilege. I think he mentioned his lawyers and the possibility that he would be talking to them about what was being said by Deputy Catherine Murphy, myself, Deputy Pearse Doherty and others in the Dáil in 2012. It has taken this long for the truth to come out but let us remember what was happening to ordinary people back in 2012 while these guys were getting their debts written off. That is the sickening part of all of this.  What we are actually seeing is a Government which is intensifying and accelerating the giveaway of this country's assets, economy, enterprises and banks to a tiny elite of corporate vultures. There is no other word for them. The truth of what is happening, in terms of the economic policies of this Government, as has been alluded to already, is not to be found in the Government's Spring Statement but in the rich list that was published last weekend in The Sunday Times. This is only the latest piece of evidence which follows on from a TASC report as well as the Credit Suisse global wealth report showing the same thing, namely that there has been an astonishing growth in the wealth of the tiny elite of wealthiest people in this country such that the 250 richest individuals now have €75 billion between them which is equivalent to more than 30% of our GDP. That is extraordinary, especially when one considers that the bottom 50% of our population has only €63 billion. The spectacular growth in the gap between the rich and poor has been accelerated by this Government. We will not address the injustice that has been inflicted on Irish citizens unless we have a redistributive tax policy that is willing to tax the wealth of the super rich in this country and take back some of the money they have taken from us, the corporate profits that have shot through the roof and the incomes of the very high earners and redistribute that money to finance economic equality through investment in the infrastructure and strategic enterprise we need to have a genuine and sustainable economic recovery that will not return us to the boom-bust cycle.  I hope the press and the media will begin to look into the concentration of wealth in Irish society, which this Government dismisses but the evidence for which is piling up. Economies go from boom to bust in a continuous cycle because a tiny number of un-elected and unaccountable people control all of the money. They can pull the plug on an economy at any time. Unless we address that wealth inequality, we will return to boom-bust and we are on the road to it again already.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	This Spring Statement is effectively an election manifesto of sorts with the bulk of the promises made to be implemented after the next general election. It is a series of political promises but we know well what happens to political promises. They are made to be broken, according to the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, who said that is what politicians do at election time - they make promises they fully intend to break after the election. That is what happened in 2011 and this Government cannot be trusted or believed. What we have heard today in this Spring Statement is effectively pie in the sky. It is important to note what this Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition promised in 2011 and what it did with its promises and commitments. We heard a lot about a democratic revolution but we hear very little about it nowadays. Fine Gael told us that it would burn the bondholders and that not another cent would be given to the banks. The Labour Party went even further and said that it would be Labour's way and not Frankfurt's way. Its infamous Tesco-style advertisements promised no cuts to child benefit, opposition to domestic water charges and so forth. It contained very specific promises and lines such as "Look what Fine Gael have in store for you" and "Fine Gael - Every Little Hurts". The Labour Party in government went on to cut child benefit, with a loss of up to €1,500 for many families. A Labour Party Minister is now implementing the introduction of domestic water charges, having gone around north Tipperary in the last election campaign asking people to vote for him to ensure that Fine Gael could not introduce such charges. We were also told that the Labour Party would protect the vulnerable, a point to which I will return later. This Fine Gael-Labour Party Government continued the austerity of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and did exactly the opposite to what it had promised. Government policy in the past four years has deliberately increased the income and assets of the super rich in society. It ensured that austerity affected only low and middle income families while there was a recovery for the wealthy and the super rich. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, spoke about sharing the fruits of economic growth. He said that a functioning society is a fair one, where the fruits of economic growth are shared among all of the people, which demonstrates both dishonesty and hypocrisy. We know for a fact, as referred to by other speakers, that very wealthy people have increased their income and assets hugely during the course of this recession. An article in The Sunday Times last weekend pointed out that Ireland's super wealthy now have a combined wealth that surpasses the heights reached at the peak of the Celtic tiger era. Ireland's 250 richest people have increased their wealth by more than 15% in the past year to €75 billion, equivalent to 30% of Irish GDP. The number of Irish billionaires has increased from nine last year to 13 this year. There have been huge increases in the financial assets of the super rich as confirmed by the Central Statistics Office. The increase in assets from the time of the bust in 2008 to 2013 was €93 billion or an increase of 51% of GDP and there have been further increases since then. The situation is exactly the same with regard to income. A very small proportion of very wealthy people have huge incomes. The 10,000 wealthiest have average incomes of €595,000, a figure supplied to me by the Minister, Deputy Noonan. That wealth situation was confirmed about a month ago by the Sunday Independent rich list of the 300 wealthiest people in Ireland. Those 300 people have €84 billion between them. So the super-rich have done very well out of this recession while ordinary people have paid for it which they had no hand, act or part in creating. On the other hand, it is instructive to look at what has happened to ordinary low and middle-income families. A recent Central Statistics Office report, the SILC report, shows that 400,000 children are living in households experiencing multiple forms of deprivation, of whom 135,000 are suffering daily material deprivation. The number of children living in consistent poverty has doubled from 6% to almost 12%. The Labour Party claimed it would protect the vulnerable and particularly social welfare recipients. What is the record of the Labour Party and the Tánaiste in social welfare? She protected the social welfare recipients and low and middle-income families but I am afraid the cuts she introduced in recent budgets have devastated ordinary people and undermined the social welfare system. It is important to mention some of those cuts, which I call the dirty baker's dozen cuts: child benefit was cut by up to €1,500 per annum per family; cuts to the back-to-school allowance; cuts to maternity benefit; cuts to the fuel allowance; abolition of the telephone allowance; cuts to the household benefits package; cuts to jobseeker's allowance; new qualifications for State pensions particularly affecting women who are out of the workforce to rear their families; the carer's respite grant was cut by €325; farm assist payments cut; back-to-education allowance cut; exceptional needs payment cut; increase in eligibility for State pensions; taxation of maternity benefit; abolition of illness benefit for widows and lone parents who work; huge cuts, of course, to one-parent families with another huge cut coming on 2 July; cuts to rent allowance; and abolition, unbelievably, of the very small bereavement grant. The so-called recovery is a recovery for those who are already wealthy and it certainly means continued austerity for low and middle-income families. The public does not trust or believe the Government. They know that what the Government says does not transfer into action. They know that middle and low-income families have been crucified by the Government. They want to see the Government going to the country and calling a general election. The Government has absolutely no mandate for what it has done. The public believe that it simply cannot be trusted. This spring statement is simply an election manifesto of sorts, one that the public will not believe and one that should be put to the country sooner rather than later.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	242	On 27 March EirGrid published, for public comment, a discussion paper on Ireland's grid development strategy, entitled "Your Grid, Your Views, Your Tomorrow". The paper, which reviews, inter alia, the grid link, Grid West, and North-South transmission line projects, confirms that Ireland’s energy transmission needs may be met with reduced new infrastructure build because of new technological developments and updated projections of future electricity demand. The discussion paper, which was subject to an independent peer review, confirms the need to reinforce the transmission system in the south east. It suggests an additional option to the original grid link options. The original options would require either the construction of significant amounts of new overhead lines or the laying of significant amounts of underground cable. The additional option contained in the recently published discussion document would involve an underwater cable in the Shannon Estuary and upgrading existing transmission lines rather than building new lines. The discussion paper also puts forward options for Grid West. The options include underground cabling, a 400 kV overhead line option and a 220 kV overhead line with some of the line placed underground. The discussion paper reaffirms the need for the North South transmission line project and that the existing proposal for a 400 kV overhead line remains the most appropriate solution for the project. In setting out its revised approach, EirGrid has confirmed that every project is different, so that an option that may be technically feasible for one project may not work for another. The Deputy will be aware of the independent expert panel that is overseeing the integrity of the process being undertaken by EirGrid to report on the Grid West and grid link projects. The EirGrid reports are required to be comprehensive, route-specific studies of overhead and underground options for the projects. The panel has directed that the reports must be complete, comparable - with overhead line comparable with underground cable - and objective, and must include assessments of potential environmental impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors. The panel will, in due course, consider the reports and then provide an opinion to me on the reports in respect of each project. Thereafter, a further round of public consultation will be undertaken by EirGrid for each of the projects. I expect to receive the panel's opinion on the Grid West project over the coming days. The opinion on the grid link project is expected during quarter three of this year.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Once these steps have been completed, it will then be a matter for EirGrid, in consultation with the Commission for Energy Regulation, to make a decision on which option to pursue on each of the grid link and Grid West projects. Each of these three major projects will be the subject of a planning application to An Bord Pleanála in due course.

Why can this not be done with the North-South interconnector? This has been a huge bone of contention, particularly in Cavan, Monaghan and Meath in recent years. Last week representatives from EirGrid appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. The Minister gave the line that there are technical solutions to each project. However, speaking on the record of the committee they clearly confirmed that it was technically possible to underground the cables on the North-South interconnector.This is the first time EirGrid has acknowledged that it is technically possible. It previously held to the view that it was technically impossible but now that it has accepted that it is possible to underground the cables, why does the Government not seek to put them underground? It has become a massive source of contention and if we accept the necessity of the project, the only option is the underground one.

I outlined in my initial reply the process undertaken in respect of all of these projects. The process involves EirGrid initially setting out its position and the independent expert panel then assesses the position and reports to me. That is the process we have undertaken in respect of grid west and grid link. The independent panel was also asked to examine the North-South project and it came to certain conclusions on the methodology adopted in respect of it. This is ultimately a matter for EirGrid when it brings forward proposals to develop the network we need in this country. I have no doubt that the North-South interconnector is critical infrastructure that we will require if we are to secure the system and the link between North and South. It is needed for the South and it is also needed for the North.

I asked him about the technical issues arising because for the last several years EirGrid has argued that it is not technically possible to underground the North-South interconnector. I ask the Minister to review the chief executive's comments because he acknowledged that it was technically possible. Bearing in mind the significant concerns that have arisen in affected communities and the devastation that will be inflicted on them, the Government should meet EirGrid to discuss the underground option if it is technically possible.

However, I know from my knowledge of the project and the requirements in respect of the grid that technical feasibility is not the only aspect to be considered. All of us are aware that cost represents another dimension. The issue is one for EirGrid to address. It has brought forward its proposals and the independent expert panel has examined them. Technical feasibility is one aspect of the project but the cost will be a key factor in deciding on the approach to be adopted.

This report gave an account of the structure and scope of the research programme and provided details of funding and the constituent membership of the steering group established to oversee the procurement process to engage the relevant expertise to carry out the research, together with details of the successful consortium of consultants subsequently appointed. The update report also identified the five component elements of the comprehensive programme of research, as follows: impacts on surface water, groundwater and related ecosystems; impacts on seismic activity; impacts on air quality; international operational practice and impact mitigation measures; and regulatory regimes for fracking in different countries. I have received a further update report from the EPA which sets out in detail the specific tasks being undertaken by the consultancy consortium pursuant to each of the component projects, together with the status of these tasks. I am happy to share this detailed update and I have made arrangements to have it published on my Department's website. As I have stated previously, a final report will be published once the research programme has concluded. This final report will reflect the outcomes and recommendations on all elements of the research programme. It is expected that the report will be available in July 2016.

It is a disgrace that such a document was presented as a progress report. It contains little or no substantive information regarding the progress of the investigation of a very dangerous method of extracting gas. I believe it is bluffing the Minister of State, the committee and members of the public in regard to what progress is actually being made. It makes no reference to the health impact assessment, which is a crucial part of any study of hydraulic fracturing. It is outrageous that the EPA would seek to present this to the Minister of State and the wider public as a progress report.

It is a more informative document. I apologise that the Deputy does not have it but I will ensure he receives a copy following the conclusion of Question Time. This is an important investigation and we are in the middle of a two year process. The Deputy and colleagues from various political parties, including my own, sought a mid-term review. It is important that we remain vigilant in ensuring the health and environmental issues are properly investigated. A revised frame of reference was developed on foot of a thorough and lengthy consultation process which took account of the various fears expressed at community level. I will continue to keep these matters under close review and I have asked my officials to keep Deputies informed.

I would have been worried to learn that the Minister had accepted the document before me as a progress report. I will examine the detailed information for proposals on carrying out a health impact assessment and the rationale for selecting a company called CDM Smith, which is on the public record as acting as a cheerleader for the fracking industry.Yet it is leading this study. One bit of information that came from the alleged progress report is that approximately 20 reports will be produced over the coming two years. Will the Minister of State ensure that each and every one of those reports is brought before the committee for consideration?

For example, members from An Bord Pleanála and current and retired members of different groups such as the CER, the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of the Environment Northern Ireland, the EPA, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, Geological Survey of Ireland and the HSE. A comprehensive team of individuals made up the evaluation group to decide which company would be in a position to lead a combined grouping of individuals, groups and experts. While CDM Smith is the company appointed, there is a broad church in terms of the team. The team includes the British Geological Survey, UCD, Ulster University, Queens University Belfast and AMEC Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee. It is a team effort and there is a term of reference. That term of reference changed during the consultation process and the revised term of reference is the term under which the team must work on behalf of Ireland.

When will the report be published and if it is delayed, what is the reason for the delay?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	253	Analysis undertaken by the Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation has assessed the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020, compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remained at 2013 levels. This analysis has informed a report which will be published shortly. It is important to note that our transition to renewables has been underpinned by a number of previous studies. The all-island grid study, published in 2008, assessed the technical feasibility and the relative costs and benefits associated with various scenarios for increased shares of electricity sourced from renewable energy in the all-island power system. The scenarios were informed by the resource available, technological readiness of the various generation technologies and cost required per generated unit. The mapping for the analysis also assessed the deployment potential, based on where the resource was and an overview of environmentally designated areas. The 2008 study informed the position for a contribution of 40% renewable electricity in Ireland by 2020. It concluded that, based on assumptions set out in the report, wind energy represented a cost effective source for electricity generation.  The abundant wind resource in Ireland means that each unit of installed wind generation capacity generates more units of electricity when compared with other countries and hence needs a lower rate per generated unit of electricity in order to recover the overall costs of the project. The existing feed-in tariff, REFIT, which is funded from the PSO levy on consumer bills, is a cost effective tool to support this development, as indicated by a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators earlier this year. This position has been underpinned by various reports and analyses which have examined the effect of renewables on electricity prices. The ESRI, the Irish Wind Energy Association, the SEAI and EirGrid have undertaken such studies and published the results of same. Furthermore, wind generation in Ireland in 2012 is estimated by the SEAI to have displaced fossil fuels, almost all of which would have been imported, to an estimated value of €177 million, with the value of avoided CO2 emissions being a further €11 million. 
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	254	I take it the report will be published shortly, whenever that will be. It is vital the report is comprehensive and that we know the facts. There have been reports in a number of other European countries where subsidies towards renewable energy have led to significant increases in household bills for consumers. We are in a situation where a huge investment needs to take place in the transmission network in order to facilitate the development of wind energy across the country. When we consider that EirGrid intends to spend over almost €4 billion upgrading the transmission network to facilitate wind energy, this seems to be a costly exercise, particularly when there are other technologies available, such as biomass, which could be used to meet the targets without the need for the massive infrastructural investment. Will the report examine the impact this will have on consumers' bills? Will it provide a breakdown of the impact as costs are passed on to the consumer? It is vital consumers are made fully aware of this.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	255	As I mentioned, a number of reports and analyses have examined the effect of renewables on issues such as electricity prices. The Deputy is correct there is a cost involved. There is a cost associated with any of the technologies in terms of the supports and incentives we need to put in place. This issue is about accessibility of technology, the state of development of technology and the cost of technology in terms of investment. However, it is also an economic issue for the Exchequer and the Government, because it involves supports and incentives. Therefore, it is a State funding issue also. The ESRI and IWEA studies considered the 2020 position, while a joint SEAI-EirGrid study looked at the position in 2011. I can give the Deputy additional information later or in a further supplementary response.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	256	Will other technologies be investigated in terms of the potential costs? The wind energy programme was established in 2007 and at that time technology pointed to wind as being a solution. However, technology has moved on since then and biomass is very much a solution, requiring a significantly lower investment. I have seen figures that indicate that with 10% of the cost of the upgrading of the electricity infrastructure, we could convert the likes of Moneypoint to biomass and meet our Kyoto targets and our 40% renewable energy targets. The report must look at the potential for other technologies and must recognise that technology is continually advancing and that it may be time to look at the viability of wind against these newer technologies.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	257	People make assertions about the level of investment involved and sometimes they think other technologies are cheaper, but when we delve into the issue and examine and analyse it, that is not always the case. However, we must keep these issues in mind in the context of the White Paper and the decision we will make later in the year. If we were to consider taking the biomass approach at Moneypoint for example, its capacity is 915 MW and its demand for biomass would far exceed the available biomass or potential biomass available in this jurisdiction. Some estimates suggest that 260,000 hectares of energy crops would be required, whereas to date, some 3,000 hectares have been planted under the bioenergy scheme run by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Therefore, if we took that approach, the plant would be heavily reliant on imported biomass. Such large levels of import would raise considerations as to environmental sustainability of the operation. I am keeping an open mind in regard to all of the new technologies, solar and others, in the context of the definitive White Paper we will publish in September. I would welcome the input of all Deputies on the issues, particularly in regard to renewables. Wind cannot solve all of our problems. It has been cost effective, but the Deputy is correct. We must ensure we look at all of the other available technologies. However, we cannot assume, without comprehensive analysis, that some of the newer technologies will be cheaper or more viable.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	The national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service.In tandem with commercial developments, intensive work is under way in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next-generation broadband access. As the Deputy is aware, there was a public consultation and a national high speed coverage map was launched last November. The map can be accessed through a Department website that allows members of the public to see whether their premises or home will have access to commercial high speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. A public consultation on the map closed on 12 February and that exercise will help inform the key decisions that are now required to be taken in order to finalise our comprehensive intervention strategy, which will be published for consultation in July. The publication of the map and consultation is necessary to ensure that the State intervention does not compete with commercial high speed broadband services and is required under EU state aid guidelines. Formal notification will be made after consultation on the intervention strategy is completed later this year. In the meantime, the Department continues to liaise closely with the Directorate General for competition on a range of issues related to the strategy and we intend to be in a position later this year to submit a pre-notification to the directorate. Intensive design and planning work is under way in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy. This will address a range of issues relating to the intervention, including the optimum procurement model, ownership model for the infrastructure, intervention cost and likely market impact. My Department has engaged external advisors to provide legal, economic, technical and financial advice on the various aspects of the plan over the next two years. The next steps will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid 2015. In this regard, the Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016. It is a complex and ambitious project that is a key priority for Government and for me.

The Minister gave a date of June 2015 at one stage for state aid approval but where is that now? This looks like a never-ending saga. The broadband plan was announced this time last year, before local and European elections, to great fanfare. It was to resolve issues but, to my mind, nothing has yet happened. When will this formally be presented to the Commission? When will we see credible action on the ground?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	With respect to the Deputy, if he read the monthly reports that I publish on the progress of the national broadband plan, which I undertook to do in this House last autumn, he would see a considerable amount of work ongoing with the national broadband plan. There is hardly a day in the Department when we do not have consultation or work proceeding on the plan. I would be very happy to brief the Deputy separately and privately if he so wishes, or publicly here on another occasion, on the enormous amount of work ongoing with the national broadband plan. I am not one for fanfare or repeated announcements but I am one for ensuring the work will progress. I assure the Members that work is progressing. The guiding principle for the state aid process is that any state intervention should limit, as much as possible, the risk of crowding out or replacing private investment, or altering commercial investment incentives and ultimately distorting competition. That is viewed as contrary to the common interest of the European Union.

When will this come before the European Commission? I know why it must go before the European Commission and that work is ongoing. In my previous comments I asked when it would come before the European Commission. Why was it not put in the April 2014 announcement that this would have to go before the European Commission? This is probably one of the most fundamental issues facing Irish society. Are we going to crowd people into cities and towns while leaving significant parts of the country underpopulated because of a lack of services like broadband, as I have said on numerous occasions? May I have a straight answer on when this will come before the European Commission for considerations with respect to state aid approval? When will the application be submitted?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	263	State aid notification is a two-stage process. There is pre-notification and formal notification. Currently we are in the pre-notification stage. We have external advisers testing the proposed strategy against the principles of state aid guidelines to ensure compliance. The first draft of this compliance report is due at the end of this month and, thereafter, ministerial approval will be required for a pre-notification submission. Once received, the pre-notification will be sent to the European Commission, which will assess the pre-notification and potentially seek clarification from us. To try to answer the Deputy's question as best I can, we are pressing the issue, and it is envisaged that the formal notification - the second stage of the proposed intervention - will be sent to the Commission in the fourth quarter of this year. I assure the Deputy that all the work we are doing now in the pre-notification stage will ensure that when we get into the formal notification, enormous amounts of contact will have taken place with the Commission and the directorate. We hope that most of the questions that the Commission would want to ask us would already have been addressed in the pre-notification stage. We are working very hard, carefully and diligently on the issue.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	265	Energy efficiency is crucially important to each of three pillars of energy policy, which are sustainability, security of supply and competitiveness. My Department is continuing to develop and enhance policy in this area and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland is continuing to implement policy with the roll-out of efficiency measures in homes and businesses throughout the country. Ireland is strongly committed to playing its part in meeting EU energy and climate goals. To meet these obligations, Ireland must maintain a very significant level of effort. In order to do that, we must deliver energy infrastructure and policy initiatives of real scale. This requires investment of an equivalent scale and this is why EU funding is of critical importance for Ireland's successful delivery of our sustainable energy transition. As the Deputy may be aware, I will publish a definitive energy policy paper later this year, which will set out the key energy policy actions to be undertaken in the period to 2030. There are complex interactions both within energy policy and between energy and the wide range of other policy areas that may be invested in by the European Fund for Strategic Investment, which is currently under negotiation. Therefore, it is important that the governance arrangements for EU funding proposals allow the European Investment Bank sufficient latitude to optimise the value of these funds in the interests of achieving coherent action across all EU member states and value for money for EU citizens.

I understand Mr. Kelly originally put his name to the proposal but withdrew it after a phone call from the Taoiseach. If that is true, how does that sit with the Government's objectives of fully exploiting and supporting renewable energy in this country?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	267	Negotiation is under way on the European Fund for Strategic Investment, which is the context of the issue raised by the Deputy. The Department of Finance is leading those negotiations for Ireland. The Council's negotiating position on the draft European Fund for Strategic Investment regulation was agreed at ECOFIN in March this year. A key element of this position was that the governance arrangements for this fund should not be overly prescriptive regarding the European Investment Bank scope to manage the fund. Ireland supports the Council position. The European Parliament agreed its negotiation position on the regulation this week. The European Parliament took a different approach to the Council and called for the ring-fencing of funding for energy efficiency. This is a matter for the Parliament and the Government's position remains aligned with that of the Council, as agreed last month. Officials from this Department are in communication with the European Commission as they work to establish how best to fund sustainable energy projects, including energy efficiency, from the European Fund for Strategic Investment and other financial instruments. This work is in its early stages.

If so, that would raise a very serious question mark. Currently, we are importing the vast majority of energy through fossil fuels and that is not sustainable into the future. Sustainable renewable energy must be developed and promoted here, as well as energy efficiency.I understand the proposal to earmark €5 billion was eventually passed by a single vote, notwithstanding an instruction, which was inspired by the Taoiseach, to Seán Kelly, MEP, to change his position on the issue. This needs to be explained and I would like more than a restatement of what the Minister claims to be Government policy and priorities.

I have contributed to a number of EU Energy Council meetings on the issue which I regard as an extremely important policy imperative. Energy efficiency features centrally in the current negotiations on the European fund for strategic investment for this reason. Ring-fencing is one approach that has been discussed in the European Parliament. The Government's position is correct; we should not be excessively prescriptive regarding the scope of the European Investment Bank to manage the fund. The debate on this issue is continuing. As to any particular telephone call between the Taoiseach and Seán Kelly, MEP, I am not privy to, nor am I aware of, any such telephone call and I do not know whether one took place.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	272	The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our overall energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this target Ireland is committed to achieving a 40% renewable energy contribution in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport. In 2013, some 7.8% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy with renewables accounting for 5.7% of the energy in the heat sector. Measures currently in place, including Part L of the building regulations and the combined heat and power supported under the REFIT 3 scheme, are expected to increase the uptake of heat from renewable sources. However, analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, suggests that in the absence of further measures, a shortfall of between 2 and 4 percentage points could emerge in the renewable heat sector. This would represent between 1 and 2 percentage points in terms of the overall renewable energy target. Any shortfall in meeting the overall renewable energy target in 2020 would need to be addressed by purchasing so-called renewable energy credits from another member state. While the cost of such credits has yet to be established, the SEAI has estimated it could be in the range of between €100 million and €150 million per percentage point shortfall. This means a shortfall in the heat sector could cost between €200 million and €300 million in renewable energy credits. There could also be penalties associated with any shortfall.  Analysis underpinning the draft bioenergy plan published in October last year indicates that an additional bioenergy focused measure in the heat sector would constitute the most cost-effective means of meeting a number of different policy goals, including addressing the potential shortfall in our renewable heat levels. The draft plan recommends the introduction of a renewable heat incentive in 2016 to incentivise larger heat users in the industrial and commercial sector to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.

If so, the Exchequer will face a significant annual cost for failing to meet its target. Does the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland or Department have plans to produce an incentive for home owners to switch to renewable sources of heat? The previous system of grant aid for home owners was abolished. It would be in all our interests to encourage home owners as well as large businesses to avail of the benefits of using renewable energy for heating. The focus always seems to be on providing incentives to business, while neglecting home owners.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	274	It is not clear to what extent the cost arising from any shortfall in meeting the targets by 2020 would be an ongoing one. I would prefer to leave that matter and perhaps discuss it with Deputy Pringle subsequent to this engagement. The Deputy raises an interesting issue in respect of renewable generation of heat in the domestic sector. It is not that the case that we want to favour big business or larger operations. However, when the Government intervenes by providing incentives it wants to obtain a return and larger-scale projects tend to provide a greater return. That is the issue that arises in respect of the domestic sector. The analysis I have seen suggests it would not be cost-effective or efficient at this stage to introduce a new renewable heat incentive for domestic users. 
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	275	I am a little concerned that the Minister wishes to leave the question as to whether the fine in the case of a shortfall would be imposed every year. Surely the need to purchase energy credits should be a major incentive to the State to achieve its targets, especially as the potential cost to the Exchequer is €300 million per annum. With a little imagination - the use of clustering, for example - the domestic element could play a significant role in achieving the renewable energy target for heat. If we are to raise awareness of renewable energy sources and build a society that takes a proactive approach to renewable energy generation, we should ensure domestic users can avail of any incentives that are provided. While I accept the point the Minister makes on the issue of scale, he appears to be focused on easy targets rather than seeking a change in culture or to develop a sense of the importance of renewable energy sources. It seems to be a case of making an easy buck and trying to benefit businesses.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	The Deputy is correct. I would not like him to interpret anything I said as an effort to underplay the real risk and threat posed by fines and penalties if we do not meet the renewable energy targets that have been set. I would not like anything I said to be interpreted in that way. Any shortfall in meeting our target would have a cost and we need to ensure we apply a high level of imagination, not only in the business and larger scale sectors but also in the domestic environment. However, the point I was making was that we must constantly assess the cost of incentives and balance their impact with the cost incurred through Exchequer investment. This issue highlights the importance of pulling together all the strands of Deputies' experience and their views and insights on what should be the proper mix of incentives and supports to be put in place for renewable energy across the board. We have spoken a great deal about electricity. The Deputy is correct, however, that we must also discuss heat and transport because they are part of the picture. 
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	277	The programme for Government of 2011 included a commitment to maintain the post office network. The Department of Social Protection recently sent out letters to 7,000 pensioners and other social welfare recipients encouraging them to switch to direct funds transfer into their bank accounts. What is the Government doing to protect the post office network and the vital services it provides in rural communities?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	278	Issues relating to the post office network, including opening or closing of post offices, are operational matters for the management and board of An Post and an area in which I do not have a function. I note, however, the recent publication of a six-point plan by the Irish Postmasters Union. The plan aligns with the Government’s consistent message that a strong, modern and commercially viable post office network that is responsive to changing consumer choices is essential for urban and rural communities alike. Taking account of changes in technology and general retail behaviour, significant challenges face the post office network. To answer the Deputy's question as to what the Government is doing in this regard, I established the post office network business development group earlier this year, of which the Irish Postmasters' Union is a member. The terms of reference for the group are to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network; identify the new business opportunities for the post office network, taking account of international experience; engage as necessary with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the aforementioned objectives; and prepare an interim and final report for the Minister in accordance with an agreed timetable.  The work of the group will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network and I look forward to it concluding its deliberations later this year. It is in everyone's interest that we have a sustainable post office network, one which meets the needs of the consumer first and foremost. Our collective challenge will be to ensure the future services offered by An Post and the postmasters place the company on a sound financial footing.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	279	All Members are interested in protecting post offices. Since 2006 in Wexford alone, ten post offices have closed, namely Tomhaggard, Pallas, Crossabeg, Ballymurn, Ballyhoe, Gusserane, Ballycarney, Castledockrell, Duncormick, Ballymitty and Rathnure. That is devastating for a county which has 24% unemployment, double the national suicide rate and is in the top five for illiteracy rates and teenage pregnancies. I know this is not all down to the closure of post offices but it adds to the problem. There is a serious devastation of rural areas in Wexford and other parts of the country. The Minister can examine the different initiatives for the post office. However, when he claims it is an operational matter for An Post, he is passing responsibility. The Government must be proactive and decide that no more post offices will close. It should even examine re-opening some of them. It may not be financially attractive in many cases but the social benefit has to be considered, not ignored.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	280	I am certainly not ignoring it and I am conscious of the importance of a vibrant post office network. That is why I set up this review group under the chairmanship of Mr. Bobby Kerr to report to me. I will be meeting him next week to see how he is getting on with the work he is doing. He is approaching this in an enthusiastic way and the Irish Postmasters Union is co-operating with the exercise. There are 51 post offices in County Wexford with four postal agencies providing Department of Social Protection payments. The Deputy gave a list of closures since 2006. Since 2009, five post offices have closed in the county. I am not walking away from the importance he attaches to this agenda. I am confident and hopeful that the business review group will pull together several different ideas. Mr. Kerr has great retail experience and there are others participating in group. We have to ensure the post office network survives in a sustainable way and can be commercially viable, as well as socially significant.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	281	If the Department of Social Protection is actually writing letters that will undermine the potential of the post office network to continue to be sustainable, then there is a serious lack of joined-up thinking in the Government. The Minister claims he is in favour of keeping post offices while the Department of Social Protection sends out letters that will undermine them. I accept most of the damage was done by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and that the Minister is not responsible for all closures. However, they have not stopped on his watch which is a concern for people. Will the Minister consider amending the current structure and putting in place a policy and legislation which recognises the post office network is a national asset? This will give the Government a bit more hands-on control over what An Post does, rather than saying all this is an operational matter for the company. If it remains an operational matter for An Post, I believe it is determined to close as many rural post offices as possible because there is no money in it. The Government must recognise the social benefit of post offices and prevent An Post from closing them.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	282	We do recognise that. That is why we put together this group to see what are the best steps that can be taken to ensure the post office network actually survives. It should survive and there is every reason it will survive. The Department of Social Protection contract for cash payments to welfare customers is for a minimum period of two years and may be extended up to the end of December 2019. The Department intends to move to e-payments for most social welfare clients in the medium term. Part of this process involves undertaking an e-payment procurement and An Post could pitch for this business. It is not possible to be definitive at this stage but the value of the contract will more than likely be less than the value of the current contract. Processing e-payments is cheaper than cash transactions. These are difficult dilemmas. Does one introduce new technologies that are more efficient overall? I can see there are competing imperatives in this case. We want to keep the post office network but we need it to be efficient. We want to expand broadband in rural villages and towns. As Deputy Moynihan said, there is frustration that it has not being done quickly enough. We have to find a way for the post office network to co-exist with the new technologies people use in their homes and to deal with the change in the pattern of retail behaviour which the Deputy must see himself in County Wexford.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	291	I am meeting Mr. Kerr on 11 May to get a progress report from him as to where matters are at. I expect sometime in the summer to have this report. I do not want to give a specific date but there is some urgency about bringing this forward. I would hope that by the summer we would have his report and we can then debate the issue in the House. Deputy Moynihan is correct. The Department of Social Protection recently issued 2,800 letters to recipients of State pensions as part of a communications exercise with people about payment options. Initially it had been envisioned that 7,000 customers would be contacted. The Department of Social Protection has no plans to issue further letters at this stage. The customers were randomly selected and invited to consider receiving their welfare payments directly into an account in a financial institution. The invitation was entirely voluntary. All payment options continue to be fully available to all customers where relevant. No customer with a social welfare entitlement will remain unpaid by virtue of not being able to receive a payment electronically.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	292	The renewable electricity feed-in tariff, REFIT, schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources including small scale hydro, biomass and wind. Based around power purchase agreements between generators and electricity suppliers, REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15-year period. Small scale renewable generation is eligible to apply for support under the REFIT schemes. The SEAI, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, provides a range of supports to businesses and home owners in the deployment of renewable energy technologies including training and advice. Businesses and home owners wishing to develop renewable energy projects can also avail of grant support for investment in renewable energy installations under the better energy communities and better energy homes schemes respectively. In the context of the forthcoming definitive energy policy paper, the Department is considering matters relating to Ireland's fuel mix including the role of microgeneration. Analysis of the potential of microgeneration technologies such as small scale wind, solar, including photovoltaic, and small scale hydro, has been carried out by the SEAI. Its findings, along with responses to the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, will inform future policy on the provision of any market support for microgeneration. The views will be taken into consideration in preparation of the definitive White Paper on energy which will be finalised in September. Given the emerging policy context and the requirements of the EU target market for electricity, my Department is also in the process of developing a new support scheme for electricity to be available from 2016 onwards. A key component of this will be consideration of the available technologies including solar technologies, their cost effectiveness and the level of support required. The scheme will be subject to state-aid clearance and the initial public consultation on the new scheme will commence shortly.

There was a scheme whereby people could micro-generate electricity and connect to the grid. I think the producers were paid 16 cent per kilowatt/hour, but that scheme was scrapped. That 16 cent payment normally came off the overall electricity bill, so there were reduced bills for households. Those customers were doing the right thing in accordance with Government policy for promoting renewable energy. I have received many calls, as I am sure other TDs have, from people who asked whether the scheme would be replaced with a better one. We should accelerate the promotion of micro-generation for small and large industries, villages and householders. We should always reward people for doing the right thing.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	294	The scheme to which the Deputy refers was provided by Electric Ireland, which had been offering a micro-generation feed-in pilot since February 2009. It is true that on 31 December 2014, that pilot scheme was closed to new customers, although the scheme will remain open to existing Electric Ireland customers until 31 December 2015. No other supplier had chosen to provide such a tariff either to domestic or commercial customers, although they had been invited to do so by the regulator. The Department is not aware of the reasons for the decision to discontinue the scheme, which would have been a commercial call by Electric Ireland. Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body.

Perhaps they need to be nudged and encouraged a little bit.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	296	Section 10A of the Electricity (Regulation) Act 1999 provides that I, as Minister, may give general policy directives from time to time, but I am expressly precluded from giving any policy direction in respect of any individual undertaking or person. It is therefore not open to me to do that. I do not want to take from the broader point, however. The Deputy said that people should always be rewarded for doing the right thing, which is fair. In our energy policy we must try to involve citizens who want to do the right thing and contribute. I want to ensure that in the White Paper this year we have got a real sense of involving the citizen, whether as a consumer or a supplier, where the opportunity is there for us to put those supports in place. It is not without difficulty and there is a scale issue, as I discussed with Deputy Pringle earlier. However, we must take big, bold steps in order to reach our targets but we must also ensure that we bring citizens with us. We should do our best to support those who wish to make a contribution. It will feature in the White Paper.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	297	For almost two years, mobile phone coverage has been appalling in the Cavan-Monaghan area. It is constantly deteriorating and is a cause of utter frustration and concern to those using mobile phones both for social and commercial purposes. There is an obvious need for investment in mobile telephony infrastructure.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	298	Licences issued by ComReg require mobile network operators to provide a minimum level of national population coverage. Operators tend to exceed these coverage requirements for commercial reasons. However, as mobile services are a radio-based technology, services can be affected by topography, quality of handsets, capacity of the network, and proximity to mobile telephone antennae. Any customer who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance. If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, which will investigate the service provider’s compliance with its contractual obligations. I have referred the issues raised by the Deputy to ComReg, which is responsible for monitoring mobile operators’ compliance with licence terms and conditions. I know the Deputy has raised this issue before. In response, ComReg stated that in the last year, the number of contacts it received regarding network coverage in Cavan and Monaghan represented a small percentage of overall contacts received in relation to network coverage. This does not quite tally with what the Deputy is saying, but I do not doubt him. ComReg states that there has not been an upsurge in complaints compared with previous periods. Officials in my Department have also contacted mobile phone operators directly. At least one operator has stated that disruptions may have been experienced during an upgrading of their Monaghan network in 2014, and that further upgrades are now under way in Cavan. These upgrades should, however, enhance the quality of mobile services in those counties. While investment in communications infrastructure and services is primarily a matter for the private sector, the Government recognises that it has a role in ensuring that barriers to investment are removed where possible. The national broadband plan, published in 2012, commits to a range of actions that will facilitate more efficient investment in the roll-out of communications infrastructure. Specifically, a working group chaired by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - including representatives from my Department, the Local Government Management Agency, the National Roads Authority, and local authorities - has been considering ways to address barriers to the deployment of services. The group will shortly publish a document relating to the location of telecommunications infrastructure on public roads, particularly motorways, with a view to reducing black-spots. Local authorities also have an important role to play in assisting the roll-out of supporting infrastructure. My Department has worked closely with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to raise awareness of the role of the planning process in delivering telecommunications infrastructure and services. We will continue to focus our efforts on addressing barriers to deployment in order to facilitate continued investment and roll-out of enhanced services.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	299	I thank the Minister for his reply. I appreciate that he has referred my queries to ComReg, but I would appreciate it if he would ask ComReg to take a particular interest in the Cavan-Monaghan area. The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, agreed with me here a few weeks ago that, as he travels along the N2 or N3 back to the north-west, the coverage is appalling. If one is on the phone for a minute or two the call drops. It is a constant source of concern, as well as placing an additional cost on the consumer. The Minister referred to co-operation with the planning authorities in regard to infrastructure that might be put in place by mobile phone companies. Those companies have a lot to learn about the co-location of transmission infrastructure, however. It is essential that the people who pay a heavy price for using mobile phones should have an adequate and appropriate standard of coverage. In 2014, we were promised that roaming mobile phone charges would be abolished. Sadly, however, EU communications Ministers gave in to the international telephone companies and deferred the abolition of mobile phone roaming charges, which is to be reconsidered in 2018. It was an appalling decision and a total imposition on the consumer. Once again, the international mobile phone corporations got their way at the expense of EU consumers, including Irish ones.

I can assure the Deputy of that, as I am a member of the EU Council that deals with that issue. As I mentioned earlier, we have referred the Deputy's concerns to ComReg. I have come across this issue in one or two other parts of the country as well, and I do not doubt anything the Deputy says. While it is time consuming, it can help enormously to carry out a systematic assessment of where the problem is occurring, as well as documenting how often the problem has occurred and listing particular black spots. The Deputy may have done this already or perhaps he might think that it should not have to be done, but such data could assist enormously in achieving a credible and reliable response. Specific details would certainly help, but I am not doubting the Deputy for a second.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	303	When someone rings a public utility company the process is frustrating. They are asked to press button X, Y or Z but they cannot get through to anybody and they hang up. The genuine grievances of customers, therefore, are not being recorded because of the frustration in trying to speak to a member of staff of, say, ComReg or the telephone companies. Telephone companies are in the communications business. I do not know of any other sector that is as poor at communicating or being available to take a message from their customers as the mobile phone companies. If a Member rings Eircom on behalf of a constituent they have to go around the world, so to speak, before they can get somebody to take their query or representation. A message should go from the Minister on behalf of the Government that these communications companies should make it much easier for customers to get in contact with them and speak to a person, hopefully a person on the island of Ireland rather than someone overseas.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	304	I agree that all providers of services should be fully accessible to customers. That is a fair point but the point I was making was that if the Deputy, or anyone in the House, is aware of particular areas where there is a continuing problem - he referred to Cavan and Monaghan and I understand what he means in that it is a fairly broad area - and if there are specific black spots where an individual has documented that there is a drop-out or a constant problem, that would make it easier for me to pursue that issue as a specific problem. One of the major operators has informed my Department that its customers in Monaghan would have experienced disruption in their voice services while it was upgrading the network. If there is a drop-off or a problem in a particular area and we are told by the operator that there is an upgrading going on we will be able to see whether those two things match up. Can we answer the problem people have by what is being said by the operator?

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	307	The national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately €2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next two years. Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. That map is available. The areas marked BLUE represent areas that will have access to the commercial sector. The AMBER areas show the target areas for the State intervention and include Knockferry in the townland of Knock North. Members of the public can consult the map to establish for themselves the precise location and status of their individual premises. Intensive design and planning work is under way in my Department to produce a detailed intervention strategy for the AMBER area which as I said includes the particular location referred to by the Deputy. Following a public consultation process on the draft intervention strategy this summer, I hope to move to formal procurement phase towards the end of this year in order to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The order by which locations throughout the country will be selected for delivery of service will be determined in consultation with the winning bidder or bidders. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a five year period. Ultimately, every premises in Ireland will have access to reliable high speed broadband as a consequence of this initiative. This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for me and for the Government and aims to conclusively address current broadband connectivity issues in mainly rural parts of the country.

It goes without saying that the deficiencies in rural broadband are impacting on jobs, impeding regional recovery and depriving consumers from getting the best value in regard to broadband. I commend the Minister on the plans we have to roll out broadband and go to tender by the end of the year. It is an important and ambitious programme. Previous broadband plans looked good on paper. There were nice, glossy maps but they did not deliver to many areas near me, which are only seven or eight miles from Galway city, such as Tullykyne, Knockferry, Collinamuck and others which are as deserving of broadband as anywhere else. Has the Minister received the state aid permission from the European Union or when is that likely to come? Does he envisage that that may be a stumbling block or something that is a formality?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	309	There are two phases in regard to the application for state aid. One is the prenotification process and the other is the formal notification process. We are currently in the prenotification process and I expect to get to the formal notification process by Quarter 4. We can do that in parallel with all the other work we are doing to move to the tender and the culmination of the procurement process in terms of finding a bidder or bidders. The importance of the prenotification process in regard to state aids is that we can do a huge amount of preparatory work to ensure that when the formal application is made, many of the questions that might arise from the Commission will have already been addressed or substantially addressed. My Department is working closely on this. The state aids application is only one aspect of it because we have to work out, and it touches on the Deputy's question, issues to do with the likely governance arrangements in respect of the successful bidder. In terms of the ownership model we put in place, will the bidder own the network? The funding issues are very live and there is the question of funding and planning in respect of that. All the technical and regulatory questions are being dealt with in parallel by teams of advisers working to my national broadband plan team within the Department. There is an enormous amount of work going on but by late summer we should be reaching the formal notification process for state aid application. There are different experiences of different countries but I hope that then could be expedited quickly.

Is he confident there will be no delay in the tendering by the end of the year? Also, does he have a preference for the areas that are chosen first? Would they be the areas with the highest population or the areas closer to urban centres?

That is something we would have to settle with the successful bidder or bidders. That is not something we can do in advance but as I said to Deputy Moynihan earlier, I publish a report every month and I will be publishing the May report at the end of this week or early next week. I am able to show each month what we have done in the previous month and what we plan to do in the coming period. We set out timelines last November-December when we published the map, and I have no reason to believe at this stage that there has been any slippage in the plan and intention of going to procurement by the end of this year.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	313	The renewable electricity feed-in tariff, REFIT, schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid. Based around power purchase agreements between generators and electricity suppliers, REFIT schemes assure a minimum price for each unit of electricity exported to the grid over a 15 year period. Projects seeking support under REFIT must apply by the end of 2015 and will be required to meet certain deliverables in the period up to September 2018 in accordance with the terms and conditions available on my Department’s website. While the majority of projects supported under these schemes are for wind generation, the subsidies are not currently broken down by technology. The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has initiated a project to generate a report on the annual and cumulative costs to date in relation to REFIT schemes for each technology supported under REFIT. REFIT has been found to be a very cost effective tool to support renewables development, as indicated by a report published by the Council of European Energy Regulators earlier this year. This finding of cost effectiveness is aligned with various reports and analyses which have examined the effect of renewables on electricity prices. The ESRI, the Irish Wind Energy Association, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and EirGrid have all undertaken studies and published the results of same. Analysis undertaken by my Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the CER has assessed the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020 compared to a scenario where renewable electricity remained at 2013 levels. This analysis has informed a report which I mentioned earlier will be published shortly.My Department is developing a new support scheme that takes account of the structure of the electricity market which will operate in Ireland from 2016 onwards. The scheme will be subject to state aid clearance and undergo an appropriate public consultation process. The PSO levy is the overall support mechanism for generation constructed for the development of renewable electricity and is determined each year by CER. I circulate with the Official Report a table setting out the costs for overall renewable generation since 2010/11:

The motion before the House provides a comprehensive policy solution to the mortgage crisis. It was compiled with significant input from a cross-party report by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and with expert input from people working in the field. If implemented, the motion would immediately and substantially increase the pace at which the mortgage crisis is resolved. It would provide consistency, transparency and fairness in the way borrowers are dealt with by the different banks. It would ensure that every opportunity was explored to keep people in their homes. It would ensure that people were treated with dignity and that they had access to necessary financial expertise and legal representation. It would ensure that so-called sustainable mortgage restructures were truly sustainable for lenders and borrowers. It would minimise the need for the State to house people after possession orders were granted and ensure that those needs were met where required. It would avoid the use of strategic default and ensure that solutions were sought for those who cannot pay rather than for those who will not pay. It would turn the insolvency legislation and bankruptcy into the tools they are meant to be rather than the failures they are. It would turn the mortgage to rent scheme into a viable route for many people. It would leave the State with additional social housing stock at no additional cost to the Exchequer. The motion would do this at minimal cost and maximum gain to the Exchequer. It requires no additional recapitalisation of the banks with public money. The motion is not politically motivated. It recognises positive trends in the mortgage crisis. It recognises policy efforts by the Government and the Central Bank of Ireland. It brings to the Dáil many recommendations included in the report of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform which was published last year. Had the measures in the motion been implemented in 2011, the mortgage crisis would by now be a thing of the past. The economy would be growing faster, public finances would be healthier, unemployment would be lower and untold social harm and distress would have been avoided. The measures in the motion, however, have yet to be implemented. As a result, more than 150,000 mortgages in Ireland were still in arrears in December. Approximately 400,000 men, women and children are living in these homes. What do they face? The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform published a report last year which was supported by every member of that committee bar one. The member was not a Government Deputy. The committee met with the chief executives of the four main banks and with organisations working with borrowers on a daily basis. We met with the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the official assignee in bankruptcy. We met with the Governor of the Central Bank and received submissions from professional bodies including those representing personal insolvency practitioners. What did we find? We found that those in mortgage arrears face a system that is neither transparent nor consistent. We found that while some lenders are making efforts, others are not, particularly in my view Bank of Ireland. We found that the personal insolvency process was clearly not delivering personal insolvency or bankruptcy arrangements at any scale. We found that sustainability was narrowly defined from the point of view of the lender and not the borrower. We found that many mortgage restructures did not have a plan for when borrowers retired other than to sell their homes. We found that some lenders were far too keen to initiate legal proceedings. We found a lack of transparency for borrowers including, for example, in explaining why particular restructuring options were being offered but not others. We found the mortgage to rent scheme was next to useless. We found that there were potential solutions available which were not being offered or developed by all of the lenders, including debt for equity solutions. In short, we found that while genuine efforts were being made by some lenders, across the country borrowers faced a mortgage arrears environment that was not transparent, that did not ensure sustainable solutions, that did not provide equity, that did not sufficiently protect people's dignity, that did not sufficiently protect Exchequer funds and that unnecessarily hindered economic growth and job creation. The joint committee's report called for changes to address all of these issues. Nearly one year later and an incredible seven years into the mortgage crisis, however, these changes have not been implemented. They were not implemented by the last Government and they have yet to be implemented by this one. The problems identified, which will be familiar to every Deputy, are being played out in every Circuit Court in the country. I encourage every Deputy to take a morning to sit through the repossession hearings that are occurring in the Circuit Court in their constituencies. Played out before their eyes, they will see the issues many Deputies, including myself, have raised and the issues that were raised in the report of the joint committee. I will give the House an example from Bray Circuit Court which I attended two weeks ago. In total, ten orders for possession were granted. In eight of these, the borrowers, or defendants as they are called, did not appear. Neither of the two who appeared had legal representation. When the order for possession was granted, one of them turned around and asked people seated in the court "What does all that mean?". He did not understand that he had just lost his home and been given a few months to find alternative accommodation. In this case, no payments had been made since 2011 so it may be that there was no option other than to grant possession. However, we do not know if he would have qualified for mortgage to rent. Might a restructuring have been possible before the arrears started to pile up? We do not know.What penalties was the Bank adding to the original mortgage payments? We do not know. Was he to be pursued for the residual debts? We do not know. What was the cost of rehousing to the State and could it have been used to keep him in his house with the State taking an equity in the house in lieu of payments? We do not know but, based on what I saw, it is unlikely he had access to financial expertise. It is unlikely that he had a professional negotiate on his behalf with the lender and it is unlikely that he had access to legal representation but chose not to have it in court.  The motion before the House addresses the concerns raised by the finance committee. It addresses the failures seen in repossessions occurring around the country. If this motion is voted through the Dáil this evening and implemented, it will change the case outlined above. The man in question, when falling into arrears, will have access to financial and insolvency expertise. Every possible solution to keep him in his home, including the option of a functioning mortgage-to-rent system, will be pursued. The solutions would be defined as sustainable from his perspective and not just the lender's perspective. The solutions will be available regardless of who is his lender. The insolvency option will be real and available. If court proceedings commence, he will have legal representation in court. If the lender refuses to accept a workable solution, a formal opinion can be provided to the registrar or judge to that effect and the registrar or judge can then refuse to grant possession. If, having explored every option, there is still no viable solution other than to sell his home this will have been spotted early in the process to avoid the build-up of arrears and maximise the residual money left over to find another home. The changes called for by the finance committee have not been implemented. I have tabled this motion to give the Dáil the opportunity to debate those changes, and others, and to consider adding its voice to the voice of the finance committee. The changes called for would immediately and substantially improve the situation currently faced by hundreds of thousands of men, women and children living in homes that are in mortgage arrears. They have waited far too long for this crisis to be resolved. There is no need for them to wait any longer. All that is needed is for the Dáil to vote through this motion tonight.

I commend Deputy Stephen Donnelly on bringing this matter before the House. I commend him on not just discussing the huge crisis but for putting forward solutions. That is what Independents do. That is why we are different and that is why we are outsiders to the political establishment and the elite in this country. Independent Deputies will stand up and protect the rights of our citizens. In this debate tonight, we show in a clear and concise manner solutions to the mortgage arrears problem. I challenge Deputy Barry Cowen's comments over the weekend. He stated that Independents need to explain their policies and what they stand for. During the week, Deputy Catherine Murphy, an Independent Deputy, did an excellent job on the Siteserv issue. Recently, Deputy Tom Fleming led the charge in respect of small rural schools and the Government sat up and took note. Tonight is another example. Tonight Deputy Stephen Donnelly pushes this issue. That is what Independent Deputies are about, these are our policies and here are our practical solutions. As of December 2014, 156,352 mortgages were in arrears in Ireland. That figure is significantly higher than the figure in comparable countries. The suffering and social cost for those affected by arrears and repossession is ongoing. The nation is also suffering the socioeconomic cost of mortgage arrears and repossessions. Tonight I emphasise families and their family homes. They have to be given priority. The banks have to accept this and get on with implementing sensible solutions. The banks should never forget what they, along with a group of elite and incompetent people, did to this State and our citizens. People should realise that it was not the bank guarantee that sank the country but bad decisions made by a small group of this country's powerful citizens during the boom. The identity of who is responsible is no secret, but that is another day's work. We talk about debt and we talk about supporting people. Independent Deputies will challenge the European view on debt and mortgage arrears. We should look at our own history and that of Europe. Our friends in Greece are European citizens. The lectures coming from the bigger countries are scandalous. Germany defaulted unilaterally in the 1930s. It got massive debt relief in 1953. Poland had large debts written off in 1989. Greece is a damaged and broken country and the European Union should help it. The Government should support it as well. We need a collective response, such as in this debate. We should not be isolating and attacking people. I welcome the recent reductions in total mortgage arrears levels. I also welcome the initiatives by some lenders to provide borrower-focused debt restructuring solutions. I support strongly Deputy Stephen Donnelly's support of the recommendations of the 2014 cross-party Report on Hearings on Matters Relating to Mortgage Arrears Resolution Processes of the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure. We need to look at the details and examine what is actually going on. We need to face the reality of what is happening on the ground. There is a complete lack of financial expertise available to many borrowers facing mortgage difficulties and repossession. There is a lack of legal representation available to many borrowers facing mortgage difficulties and repossessions. There is an inconsistency in the approach being taken by different lenders to mortgage restructuring and repossessions. There is a lack of transparency in reaching decisions on mortgage debt. There is the lack of a mechanism to mandate lenders to provide reasonable solutions. There is a complete absence of stress testing of restructuring proposals. Low levels of insolvency arrangements, including bankruptcies, are being agreed. There is a prevalence of five year income attachment orders to bankruptcy orders. There is a low take-up of the mortgage-to-rent scheme and onerous eligibility criteria. That is what is going on at the moment in this country. It is important that we focus, but we should never forget that families, mothers, fathers and young children are involved. Many of them lost their jobs and have found themselves in very difficult situations. What do we need to do to help these people? We need to fund provision, at the start of the process, of independent financial expertise to borrowers in arrears, including personal insolvency expertise, where those borrowers cannot afford such expertise. We need to fund the provision of adequate legal representation to borrowers facing repossession threats, where those borrowers cannot afford such representation. We also need to request the Central Bank to define what constitutes a sustainable solution from the borrower's point of view, including stress testing and the retirement period for borrowers. We need to strongly incentivise the provision of a set of solutions across lenders, to include split mortgages, mortgage-to-rent schemes and certainty on residual debt when properties are sold or surrendered. We need to incentivise lenders to realise consistency, transparency and fairness in proposed solutions.  We need to examine the legislation. We need to amend the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and reduce the bankruptcy period to one year, until resolution of the mortgage arrears issue. We need to reduce the maximum payment attachment order period to three years, until resolution of the mortgage arrears issue. We need to simplify and streamline the personal insolvency process.We need to empower the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, to provide a formal opinion where solicited by a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, on the adequacy of the PIP's restructuring proposals. We must consider removing the payment of VAT on insolvency disbursements. These are some of the proposals contained in this excellent motion. It is important that the Government listen. It is not doing so at the moment. It needs to up its game. The Minister of State and the Government must listen carefully to the solutions to these problems. I support the proposal to amend the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 to ensure that any repossession action includes a sustainable restructuring proposal for all outstanding debts and to allow consideration of the ISI's opinion as to the adequacy of the PIP's restructuring proposals as grounds for refusal of the application for repossession. I would like to amend the parameters of the mortgage-to-rent scheme so that a reasonable number of homes qualify for consideration and for consideration to be given to a mortgage-to-lease scheme providing off-balance sheet funding to purchase repossessed homes. We should review the outcome of repossession hearings so as to understand the level of consistency in the granting of repossession orders. It is important that the Minister consider these proposals. Today, the Minister for Finance stated that the current strategy had assisted borrowers and lenders in reaching agreements, with the restructuring of 115,000 mortgage accounts. He also stated that the Government intended to make an announcement on this issue in the coming weeks. If he listens carefully tonight, however, he will see that there are excellent proposals in this motion. It is important that we challenge those who question the integrity, vision and leadership of many Independent Deputies. Not only do we hold the Government to account but, as with tonight's motion from Deputy Donnelly, we propose sensible solutions that are on the side of the people, taxpayers and, in particular, those families that are suffering and in deep crisis owing to mortgage arrears.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	321	I commend my colleague in the Technical Group, Deputy Donnelly, on proposing workable solutions. The Government would be well advised to consider what has been proposed, although there will be a countermotion. People often view a house as a piece of property. It is one thing to lose a piece of property, but it is another to lose one's home. Every Deputy has met people who were about to lose their homes and had uncertain futures. It is particularly traumatic where children are involved. This morning, I listened to a guy on my local radio station. He was 34 and had a few kids who were farmed out to family members in a different county and were not getting to school. His wife was just out of hospital. He talked about losing weight, stress and breaking down. People must put themselves out there and tell these stories if they are to be understood. This situation is wrong. Trends have been emerging in this issue, one of which has repeated and become embedded in the prevailing culture. A moral hazard exists for the little people, in that people who owe small amounts are treated differently from those who are heavily indebted. It may not be a mortgage or a home, but there is a difference in their treatment. For example, 11,000 mortgages were cruelly sold by IBRC's special liquidators without any concern for the welfare of individuals. The mortgages were broken up into four segments, including buy-to-let, non-performing and performing loans. Even those with performing loans felt that they were being placed in a perilous situation. I could not see the logic in selling the non-performing loans. People might have been able to sustain their mortgages at the discounted rates at which they were being sold on the markets. Where is the State's financial logic in pursuing people for the full value of their loans, perhaps even through the courts, and those people ending up on housing lists or receiving rent assistance? This contrasts sharply with how large commercial people with debts to the same bank were treated. Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank comprised IBRC. Interestingly, a name keeps cropping up, that being, KPMG. It was Irish Nationwide's auditor, but that audit did not show what perhaps it should have. There is a question as to whether KPMG should sue itself to get a result in that regard. Irish Nationwide Building Society's mortgage holders are paying the price. I will focus on the likes of the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO. If anyone approaches me with a mortgage problem, that is where I go. The IMHO has been telling us that the scale of repossession is accelerating. Where will those families go? The housing waiting list comprises close to 100,000 individuals and families. There is no private rented accommodation. This situation is particularly difficult in areas where the waiting lists are longer. The State will need to assist with rents. If someone cannot repay a mortgage, he or she will not be able to pay commercial rent. Often, mortgages are less than the rents being demanded. If one had a mortgage of €200,000, one would pay more in rent in an urban area. It does not make sense. There are no housing options. It seems illogical to pursue people and put them under such stress without there being solutions. I listened to Permanent TSB's solution. It may be useful to some, but there is a misplaced presumption that local authority housing is available to people. In my area, one would need to be approximately ten years on the list to have any prospect of getting a house. The situation in Dublin and its surrounding counties is not much different. The situation in Cork is bad as well. While Permanent TSB's solution might suit some people, it will not suit the majority. The benefit is that they could walk away from their debts, but they would also be walking away from their homes. What does one do with one's children and possessions? Does one break them up? There are some solutions relating to council lists, but if one works even part time, one is not entitled to rent support. This situation must be examined in a more realistic and complete way. The banks are creating significant problems for the State financially. Hundreds of millions of euro are being paid in rental subsidies to families that have been forced from their homes by the banks. If I am to be fair, that includes rent assistance. This does not make economic sense for the State, but it makes sense for the banks. If a bank wants a better balance sheet, it can now point to houses in positive equity. The riskiest time for someone who is in mortgage distress is when there is positive equity in his or her home.In such cases, the bank will see the value in forcing a sale and securing full payment on the mortgage. There is nowhere for people to go in that scenario. Mortgage holders who surrender their home in those circumstances will find it almost impossible to get a mortgage in the future and will, therefore, be wholly dependent on the State by way of social housing. In many cases, they will not even qualify for the housing waiting list. This will leave them in the precarious position of having no security of tenure, as leases in the private rented sector are generally renewed annually. Such people are at significant risk of ending up homeless. In fact, I frequently encounter people in employment who are at risk of homelessness. People whose homes are repossessed face the difficulty of never enjoying permanency in respect of where they live. There is societal damage in that, and the damage that is most profound is in terms of the impact on children and the stress levels of individuals. We meet people in that situation all the time. One particular afternoon, as I recall, three men came to see me in quick succession all saying they intended to kill themselves. They were absolutely distressed to the point where they had no hope and could see no way out. The idea behind this proposal is not to rubbish what the Government is doing. Our message is that good things are being done but we must go further. The motion is prescriptive about what is needed. The bottom line is that we can do better and must do better for the citizens who are at their lowest ebb and are relying on the Government to come up to the mark. That is what the motion seeks to achieve.

They offer practical measures to resolve the greatest scourge facing people in recent years. We have not seen the likes of this catastrophic situation in any facet of Irish life. It is a problem that is spiralling out of control at a rapid pace and affecting thousands of people. Up to 117,000 families are in mortgage arrears, with an additional 35,000 buy-to-let mortgage holders in the same predicament. The number of repossessions is surging, with recent Central Bank data indicating that the banks are immediately threatening 31,000 home owners with the loss of their properties. There are up to 1,000 repossession cases coming before the courts every week, in locations throughout the country. This situation is set to escalate in the coming months if the current trend continues. Threats to take people's home make up to 40% of the solutions the banks are proposing as part of the targets set for them by the Central Bank for dealing with the arrears crisis. These home owners are, by and large, the victims of a very much unregulated and uncontrolled market in which the banks were the reckless instigators. Those institutions are responsible for perpetrating the current situation, which has an enormous social cost. Of course, these are the same lenders which were bailed out by the already overburdened and victimised taxpayers and have now been reincarnated as wolves in sheep's clothing. We are effectively seeing a return of the bailiffs who were part of Irish life in an earlier era. The threats of evictions and actual evictions that were so prominent a part of our history are again a feature of daily life. The banks are acting ruthlessly in their application of the repossession process and are robbing people of their dignity as well as the roof over their heads. In most cases, indebtedness is not the fault of the home owners. Many people in arrears have lost their employment and are dealing with extremely stressful circumstances. There is often a high rate of illness and family breakdown. Every Member of this House will be aware of that from meeting people in their constituency clinics. We are seeing, on a weekly and daily basis, terrible cases where people have been dealt with very harshly and are suffering greatly. At the same time, the banks are crucifying variable-rate mortgage holders to make up for losses in other parts of their business. Some lenders are even giving new customers a lower rate than that being charged to existing variable-rate mortgage holders. Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and KBC Bank exemplified this policy when they recently cut their main variable rates for new mortgage applicants but not for existing customers. This is another example of harsh treatment and it is very demoralising for struggling borrowers stuck with variable-rate loans. The Central Bank, meanwhile, is standing off on the sidelines and allowing it to continue. It is not enforcing the statutory customer code that requires the banks to give fair and equal treatment to all their clients. The Government must act with speed to address this issue. The Minister for Finance needs to work with the Governor of the Central Bank and engage directly with the banks to secure an immediate lowering of the standard variable rate for existing mortgage holders. There is a huge disparity between the rates being charged in the Irish market and those pertaining in other eurozone countries. In fact, there is anything in the region of €3,000 to €4,000 of a difference in what is being charged on an annual basis. The banks are back to making huge profits and are paying hugely reduced interest rates on the money they borrow. Unfortunately, this is not being passed on to customers. Given that the European Central Bank rate is at a record low of 0.05%, it is imperative that the unsustainable rates being imposed on variable-rate mortgage holders in Ireland are dramatically reduced. This debate will give the Government leverage to take action with urgency. Thousands of home owners cannot sleep, eat or function in a normal manner because of the stress they are under, with serious negative effects for their health and well-being. A precedent has been established with the setting up of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in the past five or six weeks with Government support and funds are being channelled through Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks. It was set up to kick start small businesses, which is very welcome. Money is being extended and made available at less than half the current rate at a rate of 2%. A typical five-year loan of anything up to €400,000 is likely to cost a small and medium enterprise €15,000 to €20,000 less than the current market costs over the lifetime of the loan, which is very welcome. If the banks and the Government can facilitate small and medium enterprises, there is no reason they cannot extend that facility to the domestic market in light of the current circumstances. I am sure the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, would agree with and approve of that proposal. I mentioned the word "urgent" in this respect and at this stage for many people it has come down to the wire. People are suffering ill health and are in dire straits. This crisis is affecting them and causing family breakdowns, and that is only the tip of iceberg if the current process is going to continue. It has devastated lives and families and pushed many people to the brink. They are frightened and disillusioned and perceive there to be a cosy relationship between the Government and banks. I would hate to think that perception would be allowed to exist, and I am sure that no one on either side of the House would want that perception to continue to exist. There is a need to ensure that from tonight drastic and urgent action is taken at speed.

The tone, in particular, is conversational. While we have the jargon with respect to the technical nature of mortgage arrears and many new acronyms have been introduced in the past four years, we are all on the same page when it comes to the human stories behind these difficulties. I commend the Technical Group in that respect. The Government resolved to tackle the mortgage arrears issue head on and significant progress has already been made. We have prioritised actions to deliver real and sustainable solutions to borrowers. There is no doubt that some families across the country are experiencing genuine difficulties in meeting their monthly mortgage repayments. The Government is fully aware of the impact that this is having on these families and their lives and continuously reviews the implementation of the various strands of mortgage arrears policy with a view to identifying ways to alleviate undue stress on indebted householders. Addressing personal indebtedness is essential as our economy returns to strength. Since taking office, the Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears. This has included an extensive suite of interventions including specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and the mortgage-to-rent scheme which is designed to assist borrowers in an unsustainable mortgage position to remain in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies. Overall, I can agree with the sentiment of much of what the Technical Group has proposed, and I believe that current Government policy in this area is founded on these objectives, in particular, avoiding repossession of the family home where possible. The Central Bank's CCMA places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender to address a primary dwelling mortgage difficulty before any legal action is considered. The Central Bank publishes comprehensive data on mortgage arrears on a quarterly basis. Its most recent publication was in March 2015 and covered data to the end of quarter 4 of 2014. This showed that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses in arrears continued to fall, marking six consecutive quarterly declines. According to data published by the Central Bank, at the end of 2014 there were 758,988 mortgage accounts outstanding. Of these, 648,622, or 85%, were not in arrears. It should be noted that the number of accounts does not directly translate into the number of homes as some properties have more than one mortgage outstanding on them. It has been estimated that the rule of thumb is that there are 1.3 mortgages to a property. The number of principal dwelling houses accounts in arrears totalled 110,366 at the end of 2014, down from a peak of 142,892 accounts in June 2013. Of these accounts, at the end of 2014, 78,699 were in arrears of more than 90 days. While the arrears over 90 days remain high, they are down from a peak of 98,736 accounts at end September 2013. Indications are that the fall-off in numbers in arrears will continue. There are over 37,000 accounts with arrears of over two years. Based on the rule of thumb that there are 1.3 mortgages to every property, it can be estimated that the 37,778 accounts with arrears over two years relates to approximately 30,000 properties. The published data also clearly show that many customers are finding solutions when they engage with their lender and the evidence to date is that restructures can be a very effective solution to the problem of mortgage arrears. In March 2013 the Central Bank set targets to require banks to take steps to progress the resolution of mortgage arrears on a sustainable basis. The Central Bank has reported that the banks continue to meet or exceed the MART set for them. Central Bank data indicate that almost 115,000 principal dwelling houses mortgage accounts have been restructured - some of these may not have been in arrears - that is, almost one in seven mortgages have been restructured. Over the course of 2014, there was an increase of over 30,000 in the number of accounts that have been restructured. I am sure we can all agree that it is good news that such a significant number of mortgage accounts have been restructured and consequently large numbers of borrowers are able to remain in their homes.
The CCMA provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a co-operating borrower. Any bank proceeding to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers, in circumstances where an alternative sustainable arrangement is feasible and can be agreed, is not acting in a manner consistent with the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, or with the CCMA. These efforts can only achieve positive results in circumstances where the borrower co-operates with the lender and engages with the process. Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case. If that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable conclusion for both parties and may allow the borrowers to remain in the family home. It should also be noted, however, that even if the MARP process has concluded and where legal proceedings have commenced, the Central Bank's code requires that a lender must continue to maintain contact with the borrower, and-or his nominated representative, periodically to see if an alternative repayment arrangement can be agreed even at that late stage. The CCMA is an important consumer protection mechanism and monitoring compliance with the CCMA continues to be a core part of the Central Bank's work programme. The Central Bank will continue to conduct on-site inspections of a number of mortgage lenders this year, as it did in 2014. It is important to remind Deputies that even if a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 provides a power to the court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, proposal. In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that shall not, in so far as is reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy the house.However, this mechanism has not been widely used to date so it may be necessary to raise awareness about it with borrowers in advance of a repossession hearing.  It is important to repeat that the strongly held view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process, repossession of a person's primary home should be considered only as a last resort. Every effort should be made to agree an acceptable arrangement as an alternative to repossession. I believe the CCMA and MARP processes which I have outlined provide a strong framework to ensure this happens. Regretfully, however, it must also be accepted that due to individual circumstances, not all mortgages can be made sustainable and that in these limited circumstances, it will be in the best interests of both parties to resolve the situation in a fair manner. The motion mentions mortgage to rent which, as Deputies will be aware, was introduced on foot of the recommendations of the Keane report on mortgage arrears. The Government launched the mortgage to rent scheme nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situations are unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. The scheme ensures that families remain in their homes while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body which, in turn, rents it to the original owners. Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support. Up to the end of 2014 almost 70 cases have been completed which means those families have not had to move out of their homes. A review of the scheme was recently carried out by the Housing Agency on behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The review has resulted in comprehensive changes to the process that have been agreed with all parties, with the Housing Agency taking more of a management role in the scheme. In an effort to increase the numbers delivered under the scheme a new protocol between all parties in the process was agreed and came into operation in June 2014. The aim of the new protocol is to address acknowledged delays in the mortgage to rent process. Borrowers will be involved from the outset of the process and will be requested to give their consent to the sharing of their full information at the start of the process. This will ensure there is no ambiguity for stakeholders. The protocol includes a single independent valuation for the purpose of agreeing the purchase price, which should reduce price negotiation times. The valuation and condition surveys will be carried out earlier in the process to give more certainty to all parties, including the borrower. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has targeted the completion of 250 mortgage to rent transactions during 2015. The Government has provided an enhanced range of information and guidance services for mortgage holders, including a dedicated information website, a mortgage arrears information and advice helpline and the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long-term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. The Mortgage Arrears Information and Advice Service, MAIAS,
was established to provide a comprehensive and co-ordinated approach to assisting people in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears in assessing their options. The service has three elements, the first of which is the website www.keepingyourhome.ie  which is maintained by the Citizens Information Board and was developed as the key online access portal for general mortgage information advice. The website was launched in June 2012 and to date there have been almost 350,000 visits to the site. The second element of the service is the mortgage arrears information helpline established in August 2012, which provides general mortgage arrears information and signposting relating to the CCMA and othersupports available for those in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. To date the helpline has dealt with over 13,000 calls. The third element is the service to provide independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long-term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders which was launched in September 2012. Advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland. A county by county panel with more than 1,500 participating accountants is in place and their contact details are available on the keepingyourhome.ie website. Borrowers are free to choose their own adviser from this panel and the lender will pay €250 to the accountant of the borrower's choice for the provision of independent financial advice. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2014, 1,509 borrowers had availed of the independent financial advice service. I wish to emphasise the Government's determination to ensure that the personal insolvency legislation and support structures can work effectively to support a return to solvency for borrowers who are struggling with unsustainable debts. As I mentioned earlier, the Government's priority is to ensure that where an individual's debts include mortgage arrears on a family home, repossession is the last resort where all other avenues to resolve the arrears have been properly considered by the lender and have been exhausted. The Government is considering all options for improving the effectiveness of the range of solutions available to a person who is trying to resolve unsustainable debts, including the option of changes to bankruptcy. The Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, established in 2013, has now been in operation for more than a year. While activity levels were lower than expected, significantly higher levels of applications have been evident since the launch of the "Back on Track" campaign in October 2014, which included the waiving of all ISI application fees. During 2014, 547 approved arrangements were concluded, including 251 debt relief notices, 97 debt settlement arrangements and 199 personal insolvency arrangements. The ISI reports that 75% of proposals are being supported by creditors. In addition, there were 448 bankruptcies in 2014,
almost eight times the number in 2013. The fact that the ISI is now in place has acted as a catalyst and has encouraged debtors and creditors to reach bilateral deals to address their insolvency. In the absence of bilateral agreements, the new statutory frameworks are a mechanism requiring all relevant creditors to engage with and respond to an insolvency arrangement proposed by a debtor. We are glad that the Technical Group shares the concerns of the Government regarding the level of family home repossession cases before the courts. The Department of Justice and Equality has indicated that the number of applications for repossession civil bills remains high but has levelled off following a sharp peak in quarter two of 2014. The number of repossession orders granted by the courts, however, is currently rising due to applications working their way through the system. As I have said already, the CCMA provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a co-operating borrower. Any bank proceeding to legal recourse with co-operating borrowers in circumstances where an alternative sustainable arrangement is feasible and can be agreed is not acting in a manner consistent with the MARP or with the CCMA. For this reason, I would strongly encourage borrowers who are in a serious debt situation to seek independent professional advice through the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, or through the ISI in the first instance. That said, all lenders have indicated a willingness to engage with their borrowers at any stage of the process, even when the issue is before the courts. In fact the low level of repossessions we are seeing is related to the adjournments being sought, in many instances, by financial institutions as borrowers at that point are engaging. As we all know, more than 115,000 mortgage accounts have been restructured already and the majority of borrowers are able to adhere to the new arrangements and stay in their homes.

#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	326	It has become clear during the course of the discussions of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis that reckless lending and reckless Government policy from 2002 to 2008 were at the root of the crisis that we are still talking about in 2015. The horrible legacy of that reckless period will be with us for some time to come. While it is easy to throw around figures, one must ask what it is all about. There were 1,500 repossessions approved in the Irish courts last year. That means that family homes were handed back to the banks by 1,500 families in 2014. Some of those repossessions came about because of marriage break ups while others were the result of arrears built up because of job losses. Unfortunately, repossessions will continue for the foreseeable future because of the extent of the crisis and that is very regrettable. It is very difficult for every single person who loses their home. We all know people in this situation; they are in our communities.It is shocking to see what has happened. I am glad the tone of tonight's debate is not about confrontation across the floor. There is an acknowledgment that we quickly need to find solutions that work for families. Work has been done over the course of the Government's lifetime, including work with MABS, reform of the banks and the insolvency legislation. However, I agree that not enough has been done. As the Minister, Deputy Noonan, made crystal clear today we want to have a Government in 2018 that bears no resemblance to the Government of 2008 and the legacy it left behind. We just cannot afford to put the citizens of this country through that sort of hardship and crisis again. It is time for us to deal finally with this issue. Some 30,000 people are going through the courts at present. That is not 30,000 repossessions but 30,000 people who are in the courts. We need to get people to engage. Why do people not engage? Much of the conversation we have heard in recent years is that the banks will only turn them over anyway and kick them out of their homes. That is not what we want to hear. We want people to engage with the banks. We want to hear what the banks are saying to them and we want to be able to work with those people. While the number of families would be lower than 30,000 it is a significant number with probably more than 25,000 families suffering anguish. When these types of financial problems hang over people who might not know if they will have their family home in one, two or three years it brings an incredible stress to the dynamics of any family. It brings tremendous mental health problems to the people involved and the stress is unacceptable. We need to focus our minds in this issue. It is important that we have turned our economy around. If we were not creating jobs, more people would be going into arrears and losing their homes at a fierce rate. If we were not growing the economy and had not stabilised the crisis, it would not help the people who are still paying their mortgages. Some 85% of people with mortgages are still making their repayments, many under huge strain to make those payments every month. In particular the people with variable mortgage rates are having a hard time paying at the moment. We need to ensure we get the issue of mortgage arrears off the agenda. We need to do our absolute best to help these people. I am delighted the Taoiseach announced a few weeks ago a strong co-ordinated effort. It goes back to the report mentioned earlier where all members of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform made it clear that this is very important for all of us. This is not just a Government, Fianna Fáil, Independent or Sinn Féin issue; this is something we all feel very close to our hearts. We want to see a solution that will work for everybody. Previous speakers have pointed out a number of actions we need to take. The mortgage-to-rent scheme is very important. However, the trouble is that many of the banks do not want to become property developers or property companies. We must find innovative ways to look at other companies that are fair and reasonable, and may have an Irish dimension to them that are quite happy to manage properties on behalf of the State and where the banks can reach agreements with them to manage these. Many of these properties are not saleable in the truest sense of the word. They are not in large urban areas or in high street areas. They may be out in the country, on the edge of towns or in unfinished housing estates. We need innovative ways to deal with the issue. For instance, many of the people who have given up their homes voluntarily cannot go on a council housing waiting list, which is ridiculous. We need to allow people who give up their homes voluntarily and who make an agreement with the bank to write off the residual debt an opportunity to make a fresh start. That is what we all like to do if we make a big mistake in our lives. We do not need to beat people up for the rest of their lives because they got caught up in a crisis that was not of their making in many respects. We need to give them the opportunity to start again. We must make that pathway easy. As Deputy Catherine Murphy said earlier, houses may not be available in a particular area but at least they should be given the opportunity to get on the housing list to get some of the benefits the Government can give to help them house their family and have the dignity that is brought about by living in their own family home without this huge financial burden sitting on top of their shoulders weighing them down for the rest of their lives and having that huge negative impact on family members, especially children. That is why I am delighted the Taoiseach and the Ministers involved are making a strong and cohesive effort to sort the issue out. We should give them our full support.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	From 2007 to 2011 the property price crash combined with the loss of more than 250,000 jobs left many of our home owners floundering in the waters of a national mortgage crisis. While 85% of Irish mortgage holders are now successfully making their mortgage repayments, in some cases at significant personal sacrifice, the Government has worked hard since 2011 to throw a very important lifeline to the remaining 15% who have found themselves stranded in those outgoing tides. Thankfully we are now beginning to see the fruits of that work. Latest figures from the Department of Finance indicate that 71 home owners came out of mortgage arrears every day throughout 2014. Just under 115,000 mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at the end of 2014, which represents an increase of about 30,000 accounts in the course of that year. In the vast majority of cases, real solutions tailored to the needs of borrower are available when genuine engagement takes place between the borrower and the lender. Slowly but surely, these solutions are beginning to work. Over the past year in my offices in Gort, Loughrea and Athenry, and across east Galway, I have seen a steady decrease in the number of calls I am receiving about mortgage arrears. When people, who are in that difficult place, call, I can refer them to a range of options that are now available to deal with borrowers in distress. The code of conduct on mortgage arrears requires a lender to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement with a co-operating borrower. From my experience of assisting constituents in dealing with lending institutions, the vast majority of them are adhering to this code of conduct and are working with distressed borrowers to find sustainable mortgage solutions. If it is agreed that a mortgage restructure is not a sustainable solution, alternative arrangements, such as the mortgage-to-rent system, are available to allow a debtor to remain in his or her home in appropriate cases subject to social housing eligibility. None of these solutions would be possible without the large dedicated teams put in place by the lending institutions to engage effectively with distressed borrowers. The establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland was another important milestone in addressing cases of over-indebtedness. While the initial uptake of that service was low, thankfully it is now improving. The Government wants the numbers of people availing of this service to increase, as it is one of the most important parts of the package of solutions available to distressed borrowers. The vast majority, approximately 75%, of proposed solutions are being supported by creditors and lenders. When people find themselves worrying about mortgage arrears and potential repossession of their home, all of us in this House and members of the media need to be exceptionally careful in the use of language around this challenge. I am not making any accusations about the Members opposite. However, phrases such as "a tsunami of repossessions" or describing 2015 as "the year of repossessions" do nothing to assist anyone. Those soundbites only lead to further and often unnecessary worry and distress on the part of home owners. Professor Seamus Coffey recently carried out an excellent analysis of the mortgage crisis. It indicated that since the crisis started there have been only 1,000 court-held repossessions, which is a remarkably small number of the total number of about 750,000 mortgage holders. In most instances of court action on behalf of the lender, the commencement of that court process is not a signal that a repossession is about to occur. It may often be the case that the process then prompts the borrower to re-engage with the bank to find a lasting and sustainable solution.More often than not, these cases are adjourned to allow both parties the time to find a sustainable solution and to remove the bank and the borrower from a lengthy legal process. When representatives from AIB appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service recently, they explained clearly that for any of their borrowers to appear in court meant they had not engaged or made any repayments to the bank over a number of years. It is important to note that 85% of Irish mortgage holders are successfully paying their mortgages and 71 home owners got out of mortgage arrears every day last year. Out of 760,000 mortgage holders in Ireland, only 1,000, or less than 0.25%, have had their homes repossessed in court. Every member of this Government is listening to people's problems on a daily basis. We are acutely aware of the difficulties that families face in dealing with mortgage arrears. That is why we have put in place a suite of policy approaches to assist such people. These approaches are beginning to work. However, these policy approaches cannot be static because they need to evolve as circumstances change. As we speak, the Taoiseach and his officials are refining the policies to make them even more effective in assisting those who urgently need our help. We also need to engage with all of our lending institutions to ensure they continue to treat distressed borrowers in a fair and equitable manner. It is through this range of policy approaches that lasting solutions will be found for all of our borrowers.

This is a balanced motion and while I would change some words here or there, I fully agree with its broad thrust. It is timely that we are debating this issue as we await the Government's announcement of a package of measures to deal with mortgage arrears. The motion correctly highlights the lack of financial expertise and legal representation available to borrowers. When I am contacted by constituents and other people from all over the country about mortgage arrears, they are usually unaware of the information helpline or of their entitlement to advice from an accountant when an offer is made by a bank. That issue must be addressed in the Government's forthcoming package of measures. Not only are people generally aware of their rights, these rights are too limited. When banks have endless resources to put forward solutions, we need to ensure that borrowers also have access to financial expertise and legal advice, as well as legal representation where necessary. There is a lack of consistency in the offers being made by financial institutions. Deputy Donnelly has highlighted this issue on a number of occasions. I have experience of these cases, having gone through the standard financial statement form with borrowers and dealt with the banks. Sometimes I cannot understand the reason for banks' approaches. I have observed proper restructuring arrangements in some cases and entirely different approach to others even though the facts appear to be similar. The Central Bank should be more prescriptive in defining the elements of a sustainable solution and the circumstances to which they would apply. The key requirement in the mortgage arrears target programme is that the bank must be satisfied that it is proposing a sustainable solution. It is up to the bank to decide whether, for example, a split mortgage with interest on the warehouse portion is a sustainable solution for a borrower. It can say it has complied with the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the target programme, and there is nowhere for the borrower to turn. Sustainable solutions should be defined from the point of view of the borrower. The issues arising in respect of the Insolvency Service of Ireland have been extensively discussed. I hope the Government's reform of the service is as radical as necessary because while the numbers are improving, they are not coming anywhere close to meeting the Government's expectations, let alone meeting the needs of borrowers. It should be empowered as an independent agency to make the final decision on the restructuring of secured debt. That would require a complete removal of the banks' veto. We are hearing from Government sources that the veto will be diluted in some form. We will await the details of this but the issue needs to be addressed. The number of repossessions is growing and the mortgage-to-rent scheme is hopelessly inadequate. Only 88 schemes have been completed under the scheme thus far. It is hopelessly bureaucratic and it involves too many bodies. It is a nightmare to progress an application from one stage to the next. The process will have to be reformed and streamlined if it is to become more efficient and faster. The eligibility criteria also need to be changed. The Government rightly welcomed the reduction in the number of mortgage accounts in arrears but many of these cases are simply being reclassified as solutions that are yet to be properly tested. If an arrears capitalisation arrangement is put in place, it will be some time before it is clear whether the arrangement is sustainable. It is worrying that more than one quarter of restructuring cases involve the simple addition of all of the arrears onto the mortgage balance, spread out over the remainder of the term. The statistics indicate this is one of the least effective solutions. It has worked in only 71.3% of cases. I suspect that the figure will decline even further because many of the cases that have recently been put on arrears capitalisation will find the payment unsustainable over time. In contrast, the split mortgage arrangement is quite successful, with a success rate of almost 96%. However, it is still early days for many cases involving split mortgages. The Government and the Central Bank should intervene directly to end the practice which Bank of Ireland, in particular, is pursuing of charging interest of 2.5% on the warehoused portion of a split mortgage. Charging interest on the warehouse portion makes no sense if one is trying to separate what a borrower can repay from what he or she cannot afford. It is not fair that a customer of AIB or Permanent TSB is offered a certain treatment of a split mortgage solution endorsed by the Central Bank whereas a customer of Bank of Ireland is given an entirely different treatment of that same solution.This is inconsistent and will result in unsustainable restructuring being put in place for some mortgages. The sweetest working solutions must be enhanced, their terms streamlined and there must be greater consistency in their application. We also need certainty in regard to residual debt, because this is one of the barriers for some people in regard to acknowledging the inevitable. I accept that some mortgages are completely unsustainable. However, in all cases where a solution is agreed with the borrower that involves the loss of ownership of the home, the treatment of the residual debt should be agreed up front. I wish to touch on some other issues relevant to this debate. One of these is the fact we are in a low interest rate environment from which thousands of tracker customers are benefitting. The mortgage arrears situation would be far worse if we had an environment of high ECB interest rates. The current ECB rate of 0.05% will not last forever, although it will probably last for some time yet. However, this will not continue indefinitely. We need to factor this into how we plan to deal with the mortgage arrears situation. The standard variable rate issue contributes to the level of mortgage arrears. The fact people are paying from 4% to 4.5% in interest is an issue which has been well ventilated in this House and at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. This is directly contributing to the high level of mortgage arrears we have and any solution must address this. It is little remarked upon that mortgage interest relief is due to end completely at the end of 2017. Currently, this provides tax relief of approximately €250 million per annum to approximately 500,000 mortgage holders. When this relief ends, people will see a net increase in their monthly mortgage repayments. We need to deal with this issue. In its reform of the mortgage to rent scheme, the Government urgently needs to extend the tenancy protection service which operates between Threshold and the Department of Social Protection for those who are renting. The protection scheme exists currently in Cork and Dublin. I know of cases where it has worked and I wish it well. However, the scheme needs to be extended to other cities and major urban areas. I am sure the Minister of State is aware from his own city of Waterford that rent caps have been far outstripped by market rents. This is the case in Cork by a country mile, where a couple with two kids is expected to find a property with a rent of no greater than €725 per month. The truth is they would be doing very well to find a property for even €1,000 or €1,100 in the urban areas, not just in the city but in the satellite towns around Cork city. I noted what Deputy Cannon said on the issue of repossessions. It is not often recognised that for every home repossessed by way of a court order, a further three family homes are lost by way of voluntary sale or surrender. Therefore, it is grossly inadequate and inaccurate to use the yardstick of repossessions by court order as the measure of the loss of family homes. The statistics from last year give a ratio of 3:1 of homes that were lost through voluntary surrender, abandonment or through a voluntary sale as opposed to through a court order. This issue should be highlighted. The Opposition is not exaggerating this problem. The recent report from the Central Bank on the mortgage arrears targets programme confirms in black white, in table 2 of the report, that of the solutions proposed by the banks, the loss of ownership would be the outcome in 30,904 cases. The report stated that in respect of family homes, principal private dwellings, there were 16,683 concluded solutions. I know this does not equate to properties that have been repossessed, but it is a statement of intent. It is clear that where the banks arrive at that conclusion and unless there is a radical change, these homes will be lost. One of the major flaws in the mortgage arrears targets programme brought forward by the Government was allowing the banks to use the threat of legal action or the initiation of legal action as counting towards the sustainable solution targets. This made a mockery of the entire process and should be changed. An issue that is rarely mentioned is the issue of buy-to-let property, where the level of arrears is much higher at 25%. For obvious reasons, there is little political appetite to discuss the situation of arrears in this sector. However, this issue has a direct impact on the rental market, because if we do not put sustainable solutions in place for buy-to-let properties, many of those properties will be foreclosed upon by the banks and sold. In the current environment, those properties are more likely to be bought by owner occupiers than by investors, thereby putting a further squeeze on a rental market that is already out of control. It is in the interests of the economy and society that sustainable solutions are put in place in respect of these properties. On the issue of family home mortgages and their restructuring, it is interesting that the Central Bank breakdown of solutions shows no heading for write-downs, but this is a solution that should be used. A variety of solutions are being put forward under mortgage-to-lease and other headings, but I suggest the banks have been well capitalised by the State and by two successive Governments and that they have adequate capital, as has been confirmed independently by the ECB, to deal with the mortgage arrears crisis. They need to deal with the issue and need to do so by putting in place the solutions that have been confirmed by the Central Bank, including split mortgages and the write-down of mortgage debt. There should be no need for a second round of transfers from the State to the banks, either directly or indirectly, to deal with mortgage arrears. They have more than adequate capital and it is about time they stepped up to the mark and dealt with the issue.

It is mind-boggling that despite four years in government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party continue to fail struggling families. As of last month, there were some 7,100 civil bills for repossessions throughout this State, some 564 of which were lodged in my county of Meath. Behind each one of these is a real family with a story. It is impossible to over-emphasise the fear, worry and stress tens of thousands of families are experiencing in their daily lives because of this issue. A home is a primary need. If people do not have a home, it is difficult for them to have the other necessities for a good quality of life. It is difficult for families to ensure the education and mental health of their children are at optimum levels. It is difficult to maintain their physical health. Many people who have come to my office in mortgage distress have indicated their lives are starting to fall apart as a result of this issue. Time and again Sinn Féin has raised the issue of the urgent need for struggling borrowers to be provided with independent financial expertise free of charge by the banks. In many instances, the banks are not dealing with people with mortgages honourably. The cases of approximately 100 people dealing with mortgage distress are on my books currently. Some of the banks are dealing correctly with these people. AIB is one of the better banks in this regard. However, banks such as Permanent TSB have a chequered record. Some staff do amazing work, but others seem to take a lackadaisical call centre approach. One pensioner couple I know has tried to engage with the bank at every stage, but this couple has had to deal with approximately ten different people, all of whom have delivered different information and gathered information inconsistently. Some of this information has been incorrect and some of it has stalled the process and jeopardised a resolution.This family was told they were not suitable for the particular solutions, although they were, and they were told to submit standard financial statements. Although they did so, it is alleged they were never received. When the family went to the financial services ombudsman, legal processes were initiated that had the effect of stopping the ombudsman from investigating the complaint. I know a Meath farmer in his late fifties who bought a house in Mayo with a view to doing it up, moving to the property and selling his own house. His finances went into a dive in a very short period. He went into four months of arrears, amounting to €2,000, and his house was forcibly sold, leaving a debt of €80,000. It is absolutely unacceptable that a bank would partake in such activity. I know another businessman who went into serious debt and, outside the mortgage distress area, did his best to negotiate with the banks so that the jobs and business could be saved. I called the bank and asked if he could negotiate with officials but they indicated they would accept only written offers. The bank said "No" to all the offers he delivered. This businessman alleges that his debt has been sold to a third party for less than the offers he made. I ask the Minister to investigate those allegations. We support the proposition of the motion that we need a definition of what constitutes a sustainable solution from the borrower's perspective. The reality is that the Central Bank holds a view that there is a strong pipeline of sustainable solutions. The Central Bank's supervisory engagement on mortgage arrears update published earlier this month noted that relying on quarterly solution targets across all banks is no longer appropriate. As a result, it has written to each bank, setting out new requirements, concluding that sustainable solutions should be in place for the majority of distressed borrowers by the end of 2015. To my mind, the fundamental problem with the existing definition of a sustainable solution is that it is far too wide and it allows a bank, for example, to count an eviction as a solution. That is regardless of the cost to the family or State. The Minister for Finance has told us he is opposed to the use of evictions as a solution and the cross-party report of the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure on the mortgage arrears resolutions process set out a number of sustainable recommendations to support struggling mortgage holders. As is often the case, this Government's actions do not match its words. As a result, back in the real world banks are still allowed to treat legal actions as solutions. Likewise, positive measures in the Central Bank's code of conduct on the mortgage arrears suite of solutions languish as the banks are under no obligation to offer them. They can pick and choose the approach that suits their strategic interests. We support the Members' call on the Government to amend the personal insolvency legislation to reduce the bankruptcy period to one year until the mortgage arrears issue is resolved. This would bring us into line with the Six Counties and simply rebalance the relationship between the mortgage holder and the bank. Through this entire process, the problem has been that the power firmly lies with the bank. So far, we have had a Government of the banks, for the banks and by the banks. We must ensure that at the heart of the Government's approach is the citizen. We agree that the Insolvency Service of Ireland should be empowered and that the courts should consider its proposals. This month, the Central Bank issued instructions for full and appropriate engagement in the process as set out in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012. It is clear as the nose on one's face that this legislation falls far short of what is required to rebalance the relationship. Land and conveyancing legislation should be also amended. My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, introduced an amending Bill last year which the Government roundly rejected. We proposed empowering the courts to consider any proposal from the home owner in making a decision on repossession. The legislation explicitly dealt with the issue of residual debts and placed the cost of the process on the bank. We also support processes such as the mortgage-to-rent scheme, but examples of this are as rare as a hen's teeth. I spent the past two to three years sitting down with families in massive distress going through the process of the mortgage-to-rent scheme but, in reality, it does not exist for such people. Representatives of AIB came before a committee last week and told us the bank has processed zero mortgage-to-rent scheme cases fully so far. We are four years into this and the State bank has processed zero mortgage-to-rent scheme cases, which is an example of the lack of urgency that this Government has demonstrated in this crisis. Since this Government took the reins of office, there has been a consistent strand in its strategy in dealing with mortgage distress. It has taken a hands-off approach in dealing with the banks and, as a result, it has facilitated the banks' unjust treatment of struggling home owners, including repossession of the family home. Just a few weeks ago, the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation warned that the country was "sleepwalking" into a repossession crisis. Research provided by the economist Seamus Coffey indicates that repossession orders issued had more than quadrupled in the first nine months of 2014, compared with the same period in 2013. If the Government means business and the home owner, citizen and struggling family is at the centre of the Government's policy and process, it must take the bull by the horns. If the Government fails to do so, we will have a tsunami of repossessions that will lead to a massive housing crisis. We already have a significant housing problem but this is likely to exacerbate this two-fold or three-fold. Last Christmas this House was enflamed by the tragic death of a homeless individual a few metres away from Leinster House. As of today, my county council has not received any funding for the building of houses to deal with the 700 families who have made their homelessness apparent to the council recently, or the 4,000 people on the homeless list. We must ensure this human crisis is tackled properly and that the relationship between the mortgage holder and the bank can be rebalanced. This will ensure that people can stay in their houses.

We support this motion and welcome any moves to discuss solutions for families struggling with distressed mortgages and desperately fighting to keep a roof over their heads. One crucial support for distressed mortgage holders is the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS. The need for such a service is not quantifiable, and many of those who have benefitted from that service can only sing its praises. We need more resources for such a service in order to provide free advice for struggling borrowers. Any such service should be funded by the banks. We also need a binding code of conduct for how banks deal with distressed mortgages. This code must include strong guidelines for banks in dealing with buy-to-let mortgages and the responsibility to tenants, who depend on such properties for their homes. We cannot allow more people to be made homeless due to a repossession or the threat of a repossession. A one-year bankruptcy period would be a positive step and be in harmony with the North of Ireland. The Insolvency Service of Ireland must be given more power to act and courts should be mandated to consider its proposals. I will mention the continuing problems for people with shared ownership mortgages. There are 16,500 shared ownership arrangements entered into in the State. With shared ownership mortgages, half of the mortgage is paid on a monthly basis, and the other half is rented from the local authority. For the tenant or mortgage holder to buy out the local authority, the value is rising, according to today's prices, and the council rent also keeps rising. People who took up shared ownership mortgages, particularly in the Dublin region, entered into the scheme with the expectation that they would eventually own 100% of the property, as soon as finances permitted and within a short period. The downturn changed all that and many people in shared ownership mortgages ended up with considerably less income than they had when they started the scheme. This is not unusual for people with normal mortgages either but shared ownership was a scheme to benefit people who could not get credit from commercial banks and needed support to get a house.Many shared ownership mortgages have entered arrears and many families are afraid they will lose their homes. Thankfully, some have managed to avail of the all too narrow mortgage to rent scheme. Last year, it was announced that €20 million would be made available to bring distressed shared ownership mortgages into the mortgage to rent scheme. The scheme was slow to take off as it was very narrow and included specifications for the houses covered and a protracted process of engagement. This meant many people who would have liked to avail of the scheme could not do so or failed to do so. As of last month, just 88 mortgage to rent arrangements had been completed. These mortgages have all been taken over by approved housing bodies. Speaking to officials in Dublin City Council, only a handful of mortgages have been taken over by the council and the proportion of these that are in distress is not large.  One year on from the announcement that a €20 million fund would be provided thousands of shared ownership scheme mortgages are still in trouble. Not enough of the people affected have been able or have been encouraged to take up this process. This remains a serious issue and one which must be tackled. There is no single solution to the problem. Local authorities should be funded to take full control of the homes in question, buying out the half owned by the resident and renting it back to them, as is done under the mortgage to rent scheme. The mortgage to rent scheme must be also prioritised and residents who are in distress must be made aware of the scheme and guided through it. We also must also consider freezing or reducing rents for shared ownership mortgages to give some relief to people who have lost their job or have a reduced income and, while able to make mortgage payments, are struggling with increasing rents.  One of the main obstacles facing people who are losing their homes is securing access to social housing. Many are being prevented by local authorities from joining the waiting list for housing. More mortgage write-downs should be utilised and the option of splitting mortgages should also be applied. No one should face eviction. It is an indictment of society that eviction is considered in any case.

Some of the comments made by previous speakers were nauseating. Some of the Opposition speakers belong to a party which left the country with a rotting carcass of an economy, one which had been destroyed by their actions, while others belong to a political party which believed until recently that the solution to our problems lay in following the path of the Greek Syriza party. I have not heard Sinn Féin Deputies argue recently that Syriza is doing a good job. It has dumped Syriza in the same way as it dumped many of its whistleblowers North of the Border.

On the previous occasion, it left a rotting carcass of an economy in its wake.  When it comes to concern about this issue political stunts, such as turning up at a courthouse and shedding crocodile tears for people one is not concerned about and who are in mortgage distress because of their inaction in government and the manner in which they ran the country, have a hollow ring to them.

They are not the types of arrangements that allow people to walk into a bank with a pistol and decide they will no longer pay their mortgage. The people who visit my office with genuine concerns about banking do not care how the issue is resolved. They want it to be sorted out soon which is no more than they deserve. The banks are the final residual issue arising from the carnage caused by the Fianna Fáil Party and their lackeys in the Green Party.  Mortgage to rent schemes are an excellent idea. They allow distressed mortgages to be transferred to a holding company such as the National Asset Management Agency or a local authority. The borrower is then able to continue to live in his or her home in a type of rental arrangement. While the concept underpinning the scheme is good, only a paltry number of people have availed of it. The structure of the scheme must be overhauled. The Government will introduce a suite of measures in the next couple of weeks and I hope this issue will be one of the areas it addresses.  Local authorities rather than the voluntary housing sector are the statutory housing authority. Most Deputies were local authority members at some point and will be aware of the work done by local authorities in the housing area. Local authorities have a role in the mortgage to rent scheme. Caps on values, occupancy rates in respect of bedrooms and the location of eligible homes need to be overhauled. More important, the veto built into the legislation and provided to unelected individuals in voluntary housing organisations who do not have a mandate and are not answerable to anyone must be removed. The ultimate responsibility for the scheme must be transferred to the men and women who are elected to local authorities. The Government has allocated substantial amounts of money to local authorities to address the problem of social housing. Mortgages for which no resolution will be found with the banks are also a social housing problem. It is important to note, however, that while some mortgages are beyond resolution, the majority of people are paying their mortgages and getting on with their lives.  I implore the Minister to restructure the mortgage to rent scheme and transfer responsibility for it to local authorities which are the competent housing agency at local level. The other agencies involved in this area should be removed from the equation because they do not add any great value.

It is a bit rich of Fianna Fáil to lecture others on what should be done in respect of any matter which is, in effect, a legacy of its period in government. I refer specifically to the collapse of the construction industry and subsequent lack of equity in properties on which mortgages were taken out at the height of the bubble. In 2004-05, before the bubble occurred, there were virtually no mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days. At the end of 2014, almost 80,000 mortgages were in arrears for more than 90 days. The number of mortgages in arrears declined by 26,000 last year, which indicates significant progress has been made. There is no single solution to the mortgage crisis. The Government has implemented a range of measures to address the problem. They include the establishment of the mortgage advisory service, reform of the insolvency and bankruptcy regime and the strengthening of the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. The code of conduct is mandatory and its implementation is monitored by the Central Bank through on-site inspection of mortgage lenders, which is welcome. I also welcome the decision of the Central Bank to set mortgage arrears resolution targets which the banks must meet on a quarterly basis. The target for the fourth quarter of 2014 required the banks to prepare sustainable solutions to 85% of customers whose mortgages were more than 90 days in arrears and conclude agreement with 45% of such customers by the end of the year. The Central Bank recently reported that these targets were met. Clearly, therefore, progress has been made in this regard.  I am concerned that the lending institutions are more readily moving towards the route of repossession. This move is largely attributable to the upturn in the housing market. House prices are much more attractive than they have been, which means banks find repossession a much more attractive option. This is a highly dangerous development which appears to be gaining momentum. As the Government has consistently stated, repossession should be a last resort and avoided where possible. Notwithstanding this, a large number of mortgages are in distress. Some 30,000 mortgages have been in arrears for more than two years and 80,000 have been in arrears for more than three months. Action must be taken to deal with these mortgagesWe have to look again at the issue of the bank veto. It no longer serves any useful purpose to allow the banks to have the final say in any debt deal. The Minister should look at Deputy Penrose’s legislative proposals on reducing the bankruptcy period from three years to one year. This will bring it into line with what is operational in the United Kingdom and in Northern Ireland, the other part of the island. This should be the norm for the duration of the crisis. These two measures would help enormously in dealing with distressed mortgages over two years in arrears. A third measure is necessary for dealing with the high interest rate burden on variable rate mortgages that stand at over 4% when the bank borrowing rate is 1%. The State should be looking at a reduction in the variable interest rate mortgages of AIB, a 99% State-owned bank, of a minimum of 0.5% rather than the rumoured 0.25%. I welcome the statement by the Minister for Finance today that he will initiate discussions with the six main lenders in banking with a view to seeking reductions in interest rates in the near future. While resolving the legacy mortgage issue we inherited, we most look to the future generation of potential mortgage holders. They have been hit hard by the Central Bank requirement of a 20% deposit for a house purchase. We have to provide some mechanism to allow first-time buyers to acquire deposits and, therefore, acquire a home. The first-time buyer’s grant was the tried and tested method in operation for many decades until 2002. It made no contribution whatsoever to the property bubble in later years. This should be reinstated with a central government grant for first-time buyers to enable them to come out of the rental market, which is becoming a property bubble in its own right, to purchase their own homes
#TomBarry	unknown-#TomBarry-party	unknown-#TomBarry-dob	unknown-#TomBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	337	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate tonight. The matter of mortgage arrears is essentially the fall-out from bad governance and we are coming to the end of what would be a standard curve in that respect. People were loaned money at low rates. The principal was even a stretch at a time when the country was in full employment. There were long loan terms with 30 plus years but not everyone will have health and wealth for such a long time. I have encountered some people whose loans were in distress quite a while ago. They got mortgages when they were on State benefits. The banks in those cases must bear some responsibility because there was no chance these mortgages could be repaid. The anxiety that people in these situations feel is terrible. There is runaway debt with interest payments and many banks did not have the skills to deal with this early on. I welcome the guidelines on deposits from the Central Bank which have brought a little bit of sense to the area. I appreciate in Dublin where house prices are high that this is a bit of a challenge. There might be other ways of looking at this to see if there are innovative ways of dealing with this. At the finance committee, members learned how a 5% change on the equity to borrowing ratio can lead to a 10% change in the property value which is quite high. The borrowing culture was all wrong and very few of us at the time escaped. The 250,000 to 300,000 people in the private sector who lost their jobs were in a terrible position because they did not qualify for social welfare payments. This discussion needs to start and I hope that Members will fill up the survey for the campaign to support small businesses. We need to remember that we cannot allow the mistakes of the past to be repeated. It is up to all Members to solve this and it is up to the banks to engage constructively, as well as individually and sympathetically. I wrote a policy document about a parked percentage mortgage plan which essentially was subsequently replicated to some degree in the Keane report. We must establish what people can pay in interest and principal with the parked balance left there. One would expect and demand that interest would not be charged on this, especially when we are in an era of 30-year loans having an interest rate of 1%. We need to give more options to the people in question. Down the road, these properties can be sold or transferred with only a small mortgage on the property relative to the value it has. It would ensure people do not worry that they will lose their homes. We cannot leave these situations to the courts. I have been in the courts to see what has gone on. One has to have some degree of sympathy for the judges lumbered with an issue which should have been dealt with in this House. I know the level of skills in the banks has improved. From running a business back then and having non-core debt, I know it was just a nightmare. However, better communications still need to occur. People are sometimes not aware of their rights. We have had the banks at the finance committee explaining what they have done over the last while but they need to explain more clearly as to how the engagement process works. Restructuring needs to be a two-way process where people are dealt with and they do not have to bear all the costs of it. I welcome this debate. Increasing employment to the 2 million mark will certainly help in this regard and get people out of distressed mortgages.

It concerns 110,000 households in mortgage arrears. The Government has talked about it for a long time and a suite of measures has been introduced to support people to find resolutions with pressure brought to bear on banks and supports for individuals. There is still, however, a serious problem for many of our citizens and families. The banks are perfectly entitled to set interest rates and negotiate settlements on mortgages which were signed up to with no impediments. The banks are perfectly entitled under the normal legal way to repossess houses. However, it is not as simple as that. That is why this debate is taking place. We all know that 85% of people are making repayments, some struggling but they still do it. We still cannot ignore the 110,000 mortgages in arrears. If any substantial numbers of these people are put out of their houses, it will fall back on the State. We are looking at a time when money has never been cheaper to borrow in Europe for both the Government and the banks. I do not think the banks can go back to business as usual, profits or anything else unless all sectors of our society and economy are fixed. We see people in mortgage arrears and businesses who cannot get credit. Yet, we see the banks levying excessive rates on variable mortgages, on overdrafts, on term loans and even on credit cards, the latter with an APR, annual percentage rate, of 22.5%. That may have been acceptable in a time gone by but how can the banks hope to survive if we cannot rebuild our economy? Our economy requires us to support citizens and businesses which are in distress. The banks have their role to play in this. We cannot proceed with the conversation of the past as to how banks could be independent from the State.It is true that not all banks were bailed out, but the banking system was saved on the backs of this country's taxpayers. Not only do taxpayers continue to pay, but so also do vulnerable citizens whom we want to support. They have seen services cut back, so without a doubt it has had an impact on everybody.  Perhaps we need to take a different approach to the banks and I perceive that a turn has definitely taken place on interest rates. We want to help people in their homes and businesses, but if banks charge exorbitant interest rates it is taking it back with the other hand. The Government and politicians generally have to step in to bridge the gap. It is not acceptable and this is the reality check I am talking about. I challenge the idea that a stay cannot be put on banks repossessing. If someone has shown a track record, but has fallen on hard times, they should be given a space before banks are allowed to repossess. I would like to see some independent adjudication of those circumstances. For example, if a person has paid their mortgage for five years, but then falls on hard times due to losing a job, it is unacceptable for a bank to take that person's house. Banks should be made to wait. We have introduced emergency measures to deal with mortgage arrears and personal insolvency, so the banks should also experience some emergency measures to give people a break. An ombudsman could adjudicate on such matters. In that way, banks could not repossess property if the owners came up with realistic prospects for repaying mortgages. Let us take another reality check. A few weeks ago, a woman came into me who was given a loan but should not have been. The loan term was going to conclude when she was 71 years old, although her pension would never be able to meet the repayments. No thought was given to that. She has now gone into mortgage arrears and all her savings are gone. She is a pensioner, yet she was given a loan by a bank that doctored papers. I have seen them myself. Little can be made of it, but banks are collectively responsible for this. The banks must be brought to account and be part of the solution.
#BrianWalsh	unknown-#BrianWalsh-party	unknown-#BrianWalsh-dob	unknown-#BrianWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	339	I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly in this debate. I commend Deputy Donnelly and his colleagues for giving this matter the attention it deserves. They are keeping the pressure on this side of the House to ensure that action is taken to address the issue. I am confident that it will be addressed. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, and the Government as a whole are working on a suite of measures to be introduced in the coming weeks, which will deal with this issue once and for all. It is the last defining issue that the Government must deal with during the remainder of its term. It is part of a damning legacy that has been left to us by the Celtic tiger. It has placed a millstone around the necks of so many families, which is preventing them from benefitting from the rising tide of economic recovery. Unless our response is commensurate with the scale and gravity of the crisis, those people will be left behind as the recovery continues. Heretofore, Government policies have focused on providing structures and supports that allow mortgage holders to find solutions and avail of them. There have been a number of initiatives in this regard. The proposers are to be commended for their positively worded motion. There is always a temptation to have a go at the Government if they feel we are not doing the job to a certain acceptable standard. In fairness, however, this motion does offer some solutions and its tone is quite positive. As the motion states, a number of initiatives have already been introduced by the Government. We have introduced comprehensive personal insolvency legislation. In addition, information lines are available to those who find themselves in mortgage distress. There are a host of other measures, including a code of conduct and a set of standards for banks dealing with those in mortgage arrears. I agree with what Deputy Michael McGrath of Fianna Fáil had to say earlier about whether or not some of the solutions that are being offered are sustainable. Time will tell whether kicking the can down the road by capitalising arrears on mortgages is a sustainable solution for borrowers. That is the solution that has been offered in many of the agreements reached with borrowers. There is a difference in how various banks deal with borrowers. Last week, AIB representatives appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and they are offering practical solutions. They have identified that many of the borrowers, whose mortgages are in arrears, are in difficult circumstances. The best option for them is to crystallise the loss, write down the mortgage and, if necessary, seek voluntary surrender. AIB did make it clear, however, that that is the last resort. If some level of repayment capacity can be shown, that bank at least is prepared to offer significant write-downs to lenders. We need to have some level of consistency in the way different banks deal with borrowers. Repossessions are taxing the minds of many people at the moment. Last week, AIB indicated that it uses the threat of repossession as a tool to force borrowers who are not engaging with it to do so. Unfortunately, many borrowers just bury their heads in the sand and do not engage with the lender. That should not be the case. I strongly advise people to pick up the phone, as difficult as that may be, and try to deal with the bank because ultimately that is the only way they will get some sort of a resolution. We must be frank about repossessions, however. There cannot be a properly functioning mortgage market without banks having the right to enforce and realise their security, if necessary. If that threat did not remain with the lender, no one would meet their mortgage payments. The banks have indicated that they are using this threat to force borrowers to engage. In fact, however, the vast majority of such cases in court are adjourned. I welcome the motion and I look forward to the proposals that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, will put forward in the coming weeks to deal with this crisis.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	340	This important and vital issue should be discussed more often here. There is not a single Deputy in the House who does not understand how serious the issue of mortgage arrears has been for families in their constituency. As public representatives, we have a responsibility towards families in arrears. Whenever anyone comes into my office or constituency clinics to talk about mortgage arrears, the first thing I always do is strongly advise them to request the bank files about their mortgage and a copy of all information the bank holds on them. I then talk them through the wide range of services available to borrowers in distress. We have some excellent debt advice services, which do important work in our local communities. The financial institutions have also put large, dedicated teams in place to engage with borrowers. The establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland was an important turning point in addressing cases of over-indebtedness. In my native county of Longford, almost one in five mortgages are in arrears, making our small county one of the most severely affected by the property crash. Only a few months ago, the Central Bank, for the first time ever, broke down the level of default on home loans on a county-by-county basis. This showed that Longford has the highest rate of 19% with Westmeath at 16%. Other counties in the Shannonside region, like Leitrim and Roscommon, saw one in seven mortgage holders in arrears for three months or more. Despite these high rates of mortgage arrears, there is clear evidence that there is better engagement and communication between banks and distressed borrowers.This increased communication and a willingness to work together has resulted in the number of private dwelling home mortgage accounts in arrears declining by over 25,000 in 2014, while figures from the Department of Finance show that almost 115,000 restructured agreements have been reached by borrowers and lenders. Since taking office we have introduced a suite of legislative measures to assist distressed borrowers and keep them in their homes. We have seen the establishment of the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the reform of the bankruptcy laws. The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 included provisions to protect the principal private residences of borrowers in mortgage arrears. Meanwhile, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 instigated a new debt resolution mechanism including the writing off of debt. These were all important measures that provided room to breathe for families who found themselves in mortgage arrears. When we examine these measures it becomes clear that this Government does not see repossessions as a policy solution, and every action that has been taken since taking office has been designed to ensure that the maximum number of people and families can continue to live in their homes.  It is also clear that tackling mortgage arrears has been a dominant policy concern since 2011. It is an issue on which we have been working tirelessly and the Minister must be congratulated for his work to date on that matter. However, as we have seen with the high arrears rates in Longford and the wider midlands region, many families are not experiencing the full benefits of the economic recovery because of their crippling mortgage payments. It is vital that any future legislation or measures to tackle mortgage arrears have a designated plan to reduce the high levels being experienced by midlands counties. We must also realise that over 85% of mortgage holders are meeting their obligations with respect to making their monthly repayments, and in many cases this occurs at significant personal sacrifice. On that issue we are aware of many individual stories. There is one serious issue that is often overlooked, however. Under the Insolvency Act 2012, any insolvency planner can make a proposal to a bank about how to restructure an individual's debt. This could be a very reasonable proposal yet the bank has the option to veto it without any avenue for recourse. I strongly urge the Minister to consider the creation of an oversight committee where insolvency planners and their clients can appeal a bank's decision on how debt is to be restructured. For example, a High Court judge could fill this role. The Government is very aware of the difficulties facing families. We have made some important strides in tackling the issue as a result of the set of policy approaches we have taken. The increased communication between banks and those in arrears has also played a positive role, but we should remember also the role played by the huge number of people in mortgage arrears.

I, along with the Government, am only too aware of the great difficulties many families are facing in respect of mortgage arrears. My constituency office in Dundalk deals with constituents in serious financial distress as a result of mortgage arrears almost on a weekly basis. The situation in my constituency is not just confined to Dundalk but other areas including Ardee, Dunleer and Drogheda. From speaking to fellow Deputies it is clear that this is repeated throughout the country. This situation, which we inherited from the previous Government led by Fianna Fáil, is a painful reminder of the disastrous and reckless policies pursued by the Members opposite in their pursuit of holding on to power at all costs. I find it incredible that the party that caused the biggest economic crash in our history now believes it can use the pain and suffering of the people who ended up as victims to further its own political ambitions. That is morally wrong, and this issue cannot be used as a political football, which all Members opposite seem to believe it can. We, as the Government, understand the real pain people have gone through and the pressure they are under due to mortgage arrears. The only long-term solution to this arrears crisis is to ensure that the recovery currently taking place is felt by everyone, in every part of the country. There is no quick fix to this, as the Members opposite seem to believe. Only last week a constituent made contact with me to inform me that he had secured full-time employment. This was the first time in over four years that he returned to full-time employment. To give the House some background on this case, this person first contacted me just over two years ago. He had fallen into arrears on his mortgage and was worried that he might lose his home. He had worked in the construction industry and was earning very good wages during the so-called Celtic tiger period. He purchased his first house during this period and took out his first mortgage. He, like so many others, did not expect the economy to crash. He eventually lost his job and was reliant on social welfare. As a result, he fell into arrears on his mortgage. I worked with him over a period of time and we negotiated a payment plan with his mortgage provider to ensure that he could remain in his home. The relief that he and his family felt when he got a new job recently is very hard to explain. He explained to me that it was like a weight being lifted off his shoulders and that he and his family could start to live again. That situation is being repeated throughout the country and proves again that the only way out of this crisis is through building a sustainable economy. I see that at first hand in my constituency where over 1,000 new jobs have been announced in Dundalk alone by the likes of PayPal ,eBay, Prometric and Sales Sense.  As a Government, our main priority in this matter is to ensure that families stay in their homes. There is a solution for everyone but we also know that those in long-term arrears are not making the same progress as others and that there are too many cases before the courts. I am pleased to note that we intend to examine the arrangements already in place to ensure there is a viable and sustainable solution for all those who want one. I repeat that the only long-term solution to this crisis is to build a successful economy that is both sustainable and a benefit to all people. Only then will we see a reduction in mortgage arrears.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	343	I am pleased to speak to this Private Members' motion. This has been an ongoing issue since the crisis hit and many of us on this side of the House believe the Government has not grasped the nettle in terms of the position in which people find themselves. Data released from the Courts Service indicate that as of 1 January, 7,101 civil bills for repossession have been lodged by the banks across the State's 26 Circuit Courts. The largest volume, 1,420, is lodged in Dublin Circuit Court followed by 564 in Meath Circuit Court, 543 in Cork Circuit Court and 412 in Galway Circuit Court. The next highest number, 405, are active in County Kildare underlining increasing distress among mortgage holders in the commuter counties around Dublin. In Wicklow there are 255 active bills for possession lodged by banks. That is the seriousness of the situation people are facing. In all, 8,164 civil bills for repossession were lodged with the courts last year. The highest number lodged in any court in any one month was 382 in Dublin Circuit Court in March last year. The highest number lodged nationally was in June last year when banks lodged bills in respect of 1,632 homes. These figures are from the Circuit Court report. The serious aspect of this is that the figures show that in every month last year applications to repossess primary family homes far exceeded those for buy-to-let properties. For example, in December, 694 bills to repossess family homes were lodged across the State compared to 21 for buy-to-let properties and 167 for other unknown dwellings. In November, 350 applications were in respect of primary family homes while 24 were for buy-to let-properties. We know the reason for that. With a buy-to-let property the banks can hold on and make money but in regard to family homes they can force the people out, sell the homes and make money on them with the increase in house prices. That is outrageous, and the banks should not be able to get away with it. It was very disappointing to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, say earlier that the Government is still considering measures to deal with the mortgage arrears crisis. It should have been dealt with a long time ago. I brought a Private Members' Bill before the House recently on a code of conduct for the banks. It was to make it mandatory that the banks would implement a code of conduct but it was not accepted by the Government. We have been waiting some time for the announcement of measures promised in early spring.Meanwhile, hundreds of repossession applications are being heard and approved in the courts on a weekly basis. The Minister for Finance has stated that the banks are bringing home owners to court for repossession only to make them engage. That is an insulting remark to make to people who face the repossession of their homes. If the Minister believes that, he is living in a different universe to the rest of us. I will give the House one example of how people are being treated by lenders and how easy it is for the lenders to gain possession orders through the courts. I was dealing with a family in Drimnagh of two adults and their children ageing from very young to a teenager. They lost their income having been self-employed with a small business that collapsed in the economic crisis. The family engaged at all times with their lender through the Central Bank's mortgage arrears process. They had third party representation through the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation. A proposal to resolve their problems was put forward under the mortgage-to-rent scheme. The family met all of the conditions and a housing association agreed to pay the market value for the property. The lender, Stepstone, refused point blank to accept the proposal, went to court and obtained a possession order. The family is preparing to move to rented accommodation. While they are entitled to social housing, social housing accommodation simply does not exist. That is the reality for a family that went through the whole process, engaged and was turned down. The Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation tried to take this matter to court on foot of the code of conduct and mortgage-to-rent scheme, asking why these were not being enforced on the bank. However, its arguments were not accepted by the court, which said the code and the scheme were not mandatory or legally enforceable. This is the reality of lenders who will not touch the mortgage-to-rent scheme and of a general reluctance all around in relation to it. This will change only when it becomes an obligation on the banks to accept the mortgage-to-rent scheme and to engage. We need redress through the courts for homeowners struggling to maintain family homes in respect of lenders who refuse to engage. This morning, I was astounded and disgusted to hear that Ulster Bank was offering 2,000 homeowners in arrears who qualify for social housing the cancellation of their debt provided they made themselves and their families homeless. It is an outrageous thing to put to people who face distress and concern for their families. These are the people who should be able to avail of the mortgage-to-rent scheme. The scheme must change and it should be made fit for purpose. Key among the necessary changes is a raising of the valuation cap to take account of the rise in house prices, particularly in the Dublin area and other cities. This is the second Private Members' Bill on this issue. I moved one in 2013 and there have been a number of Private Members' motions from the Opposition, but not a single idea has been accepted by the Government. I agree fully with the reduction of bankruptcy to one year pending the resolution of the mortgage crisis. This step must be taken as soon as possible. It is time to drop the pretence that lenders are dealing fairly with homeowners who engage and to take serious action to deal with this crisis. I support the Bill absolutely.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	344	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' business and welcome and support the many practical measures proposed to address the mortgage arrears crisis. A reading of any of the statistics relating to mortgage arrears in Ireland today is truly frightening. To give an overview of the situation, seven of every ten residential mortgage holders who are behind on their repayments are in long-term arrears. Of those, 37,778 are in arrears of two years or more. According to the Central Bank's own data, 31,000 home owners have been threatened with repossession by the six main banks. The latest figures from the Department of Finance show that 70%, or seven out of ten, home owners who are three months or more in arrears have yet to reach a deal with their banks to get back on track. These statistics clearly illustrate the severity and the reach of this problem, which is not going away. There is no doubt that thousands of families fear losing their family homes. The fear is palpable and traumatic and has given rise to very serious illnesses including mental health issues for individual family members. People fear even the sight of the postman in case he has the dreaded letter from the bank demanding the sale or repossession of the family home. Indeed, I have a copy of such a letter with me, which it might be worth reading from briefly. It is a letter of the type which is sent out under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the options it gives are voluntary sale or a thing called "voluntary surrender"; in other words "repossession or eviction". It goes on to stateIn all of the options above, please note that in the event of a shortfall you remain liable for the outstanding debt including accrued interest, charges, legal, selling and other related costs. We will always seek the gross sale proceeds and a certified copy of the unconditional contract for sale.It goes on further to state:While we note that forbearance is not appropriate, if the repayments due are not met and arrears accumulate on the mortgage, regrettably this account may be referred to our solicitors for collection of this debt.In other words, "you will be evicted". The sad fact is that up to 30,000 families face eviction due to the failure of the Government to protect them. These are families who do not qualify for insolvency procedures as they have no or insufficient disposable income. They are people who have fully engaged with their lenders and are not strategic defaulters. Their only assets are their family homes. They hold modest mortgages, many of which are under €100,000, and almost all of which are under €200,000. In the main, they are low-income families headed by unemployed persons. They are in this position through no fault of their own. They took out mortgages when employed to put roofs over the heads of their families and they now find themselves unemployed because of the reckless activity of the Irish elite, including the Central Bank, the banks, the Government and their cheerleaders in the media. There is no doubt that the measures that have been put in place to deal with the crisis are simply not working. Some of those have been mentioned already, including the insolvency system which needs to be overhauled. The insolvency guidelines must be changed and the bank veto must be withdrawn and an independent arbitration put in place. The mortgage-to-rent scheme is excellent in principle but it is simply not working as the banks will not allow it to. This is a scheme which allows people to remain in their family homes, becoming tenants of voluntary housing agencies with the option to repurchase the home if times get better and they become employed. The whole question of the write-down of mortgages to current levels of valuation must also be addressed. The motion is a practical one. It may not go far enough to solve the problem, but it certainly puts in place procedures and practical steps which go in the right direction. I support the motion.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on mortgage arrears. I commend Deputy Stephen Donnelly on the work he has done in presenting the motion to the House this evening. It is ironic that the spring economic statement was debated today with talk of €1.5 billion in wriggle room available for the upcoming budget while on this side of the House we are talking about families who are still struggling to keep their homes. These people have no wriggle room because the banks will not allow it. In my constituency in Donegal, the situation for home owners is grim. There are 271 repossession cases before the courts in Donegal and 15% of homeowners are in serious mortgage arrears according to the Central Bank. Although the motion welcomes the recent reductions in total mortgage arrears levels, we must be wary of the Central Bank's warning that the rate of house repossession in Ireland is likely to ramp up significantly in the coming months with new figures showing nearly half of the proposed solutions for distressed borrowers involve the loss of properties. I therefore support this motion because it brings in solutions now and not later. Like many other motions that have come before this one, it offers a borrower-focused solution to the mortgage crisis. That has been the primary problem with any solution presented by the Government. Its policies are not borrower-centred; they are bank-centred. This forces the stakeholders involved and the borrower to ultimately heed the demands and wishes of the banks.  The range of policies seen over the lifetime of this Government attempting to address the mortgage crisis include the Insolvency Service of Ireland, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the mortgage-to-rent scheme, a reduction in the bankruptcy term and the Central Bank's mortgage arrears targets. Some were positive attempts to tackle the overwhelming mortgage crisis executed in typically bad form, while others were clearly bank-centred with no room for the borrower to negotiate. While believing the Government is far too late in addressing the mortgage crisis and that it ignored warnings given within this House of an impending crisis, I also believe that by shifting policy direction towards the borrower - the home owner and the family - we can work towards unravelling the damage already done.  This motion calls on the Government to act in a multi-pronged approach through funding mechanisms, introducing legislation, amending previous legislation and introducing new schemes and reviews of current practices. We must turn around completely in the opposite direction and undo the damage caused by previous policies and implement better ones, but this time with the home owner at the centre. I draw the House's attention to the motion's policy objectives which reflect that turnaround. These include the minimising of socioeconomic harm, avoiding repossessions when it is the family home, ensuring the dignity of all parties and equity in the resolution of unsustainable debts, ensuring sustainability is at the heart of procedures, avoiding rehousing as a solution and ensuring adequate advice and representation is provided for borrowers. The last point is particularly important. This has been a consistent complaint by home owners, especially under circumstances where they cannot afford effective advice or representation throughout the process. If we look closely at the policies currently in place, we can see how bank-centred they are. The Insolvency Service of Ireland was established in 2013. When analysed, the figures for deals done in 2014 showed that nearly half, some 448, were not deals but bankruptcies and a further 230 were arrangements relating to debts below €20,000. There were 199 personal insolvency arrangements including property and 98 debt settlement arrangements on unsecured debt. How do we make this system more borrower-friendly? We need to get rid of the banks' veto power to force them to engage with their customers. The mortgage-to-rent scheme has been bank-centred and has failed to provide a last resort to prevent repossession while saving the Exchequer from funding families who have lost their home. As the banks control the process and other stakeholders managing it have to take advice from the banks, the scheme was doomed to fail and so it has. Just two cases have been completed in the north west since the scheme's launch in 2012. Neither of them was in Donegal. Nationwide, the figure is a shocking 88. The code of conduct on mortgage arrears has also proved contentious. Currently no bank has been sanctioned over breaches of the code, which is incredible as the code is statutory and many housing authorities insist breaches have been made. If those in arrears are declared by their lender to be unco-operative under the code, the borrowers can lose all their protections, up to the point of having their homes repossessed. This is an incredibly imbalanced relationship between lender and borrower. The bank has far too strong a hold. How can a borrower compete with this amount of authority? How can it trust that the law would be on its side if not one lender has been sanctioned for breaches that are obviously occurring? The picture is very clear. Significant profiteering is taking place on the backs of very vulnerable people who are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and struggling through this recession. Much has been made over recent months of the banks returning to profitability, but the debate has exposed how that has happened, namely, by screwing people on variable rate mortgages. We see the facade that is the banks having returned to profitability, which has happened on the backs of vulnerable people who are struggling to keep roofs over their heads. This Government has allowed that to happen. It has lain down before the banks at every opportunity and allowed them to continue to ride roughshod over the citizens of this society. The Government needs to act now. More than 300,000 families are on variable rate mortgages with interest rates of up to 4.5% while the banks are borrowing money at between 1.1% and 1.5%. If all those 300,000 people were paying an extra €6,000 per year in interest, compared with what they would be paying if they had reasonable rates on their mortgages, it would contribute more than €1.8 billion in profits to the banks. That is what we have, namely, a picture where the banks are fuelling the recovery on the backs of distressed mortgage holders and people who are struggling to meet their repayments. The Government must act and act now. It must stop lying down before the banks and bending over for them every time they demand it.

It is comprehensive and practical. The key word in the title is the word "resolving". The motion sets out some practical and sensible solutions and a common sense approach to this aspect of the housing crisis. I also acknowledge his consistent work on this matter. He has been a strong voice for those who are dealing with mortgage arrears. The motion sets out the facts, the extent of mortgage arrears and the rising number of repossession cases. Last week during Leaders' Questions, I brought up a related issue which is affecting people in my constituency and others. Individuals, couples and families in the private rented sector are facing increasing rents which they cannot pay and which in turn leads to increasing numbers of people finding themselves homeless. The Taoiseach's reply was to outline the housing strategy. My reply to him was that if that strategy were working, we would not see increasing numbers of people being homeless; we would see a decrease. Likewise on the subject of mortgage arrears and repossessions. If all that is mentioned in the Government amendment tonight were working, we would not have the present extent of mortgage arrears and a rising number of repossession cases.  I had a look at the Government amendment and its language. Some of the words include "challenge", "the Government is aware", "decisive action", "effective management", "continuous review" and "concerted action by the banks". These are very fine words, but the reality is that people are continuing to lose their homes. Deputy Donnelly wrote recently about being in attendance at a court dealing with repossessions. I was struck by the description of the people in court. Some of them were present there without legal or financial advice. At the end of his piece, Deputy Donnelly made the point that they looked bewildered and as if they did not understand what had happened. What had happened was they had lost their homes. I therefore very much support the statement that there is a need for adequate and independent financial expertise and legal representation for those in arrears who cannot afford it. No one should be left bewildered by the process.  The Government amendment mentions a commitment to completing a review of the implementation of the Central Bank's mortgage arrears targets and how the Insolvency Service of Ireland is operating and strengthening an independent advice service. However, there does not seem to be any sense of urgency about this situation, which has been allowed to continue for far too long.  Recently I was speaking to some younger people who feel they will never be in a situation where they can buy their own home through a mortgage. They feel that more and more people will be renting in the private sector. This is leading to significant rises in rent, which is putting stress on the private rental sector. These people are in their late 20s and 30s and are in good employment and would like to buy their own home. However, for various reasons, such as the insecurity around the eurozone, they feel that they cannot. They have seen many examples of people in negative equity and their peers' homes being repossessed. They are also facing insecure employment. They are looking at what is happening in Britain. There is a feeling that there is a generation of British young people who will be the first generation to never consider buying a home. One young man put it to me very succinctly when I asked him why he is renting and not buying. He said: "Property ownership feels like it is a marker of stratospheric success or evidence of having been born lucky or having inherited early." What seemed predictable and manageable - buying a home - is daunting and unsettling for a generation of younger people today. We used to have one of the highest rates of home ownership within the EU. Historians and sociologists will back up the contention that it comes from our history. This is a history of tenants, landlords, evictions and the Land League - the historical one - and so on. It is becoming harder and harder. Perhaps we need to think more European and consider a culture of lifelong renting. However, that would require the Government to embrace rent management because long-term renting will not work if landlords can increase rents at will.Private renting is negatively affected by a lack of action on mortgage-to-rent and mortgage-to-lease schemes. I wish to raise two further points. We must acknowledge the pressure placed on individuals and couples by banks and lending institutions to buy properties at exorbitant prices and with exorbitant mortgages. We must differentiate between those who bought houses as their homes and those who bought to build property portfolios. These two points must be considered in the context of writing off mortgage arrears. The banks owe their solvency to the Government and the people. In turn, the Government's priority must be the people. It must be firm with the banks and ensure that repossessions and arrears are handled humanely rather than via a corporate and profit-driven model only. The way to solve any problem is through working together. Deputy Donnelly has acknowledged the interventions and progress that have been made. As such, I hope that the Government will acknowledge and take on board some of his proposals and suggestions.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	347	I will begin by echoing the sentiments expressed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, when he delivered the Government's opening response to this debate. I join with Deputies on all sides in thanking Deputy Donnelly for tabling this Private Members' motion on mortgage arrears. I welcome the opportunity to contribute on what everyone agrees is an important issue, one that I assure the House is rightly receiving significant attention from the Government. The tabling of this motion was timely. We have heard a range of views from all sides of the House that will be useful to the Government's considerations in the context of its imminent announcement on mortgage arrears. Turning to her request, I assure Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan that every idea raised during this debate will be considered. There is no monopoly on good ideas. We do not believe that the Government has all of the answers. Many ideas raised and suggestions made during this debate are under active consideration. An announcement from the Government is imminent, as the Minister outlined in his spring economic statement this afternoon. From listening to the debate, it strikes me that the Government and members of the Opposition are looking to achieve similar outcomes in respect of mortgage arrears and retention of the family home. We could have a debate on how best to achieve those outcomes. Addressing personal indebtedness is essential as our economy returns to strength. In that sense, I do not accept Deputy Pringle's suggestion that it is ironic to hold this debate on the day of the spring statement. Getting to full employment, reducing taxation, putting more money in people's pockets and increasing domestic demand in the economy will help a normal banking and mortgage system to function. Since taking office, the Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears, which the motion recognises. The strategy has included an extensive suite of interventions, for example, specific Central Bank targets for the banks through the mortgage arrears resolution targets, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation, which must be recognised by all sides, the provision of advice through Department of Social Protection-led initiatives and the mortgage-to-rent scheme, which is designed to assist borrowers in unsustainable mortgage positions to remain in their homes through the involvement of social housing agencies. However, some of the criticism of that scheme made this evening was legitimate in terms of the need to reconsider it. The Central Bank's most recent publication, published in March 2015, covered data to the end of quarter 4 of 2014 and showed that the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling homes - family homes - in arrears continued to fall, marking six consecutive quarterly declines. The Central Bank also showed that there were 758,988 mortgage accounts outstanding in December and, of these, 648,622 or approximately 85% were not in arrears. This is an important statistic and sets a context for holding debates and considering the entire mortgage situation. While the number of accounts in arrears over 90 days remains high, they are down from a peak of 98,736 at the end of September 2013 and stood at 78,699 last December. While much remains to be done, this represents a 20% decrease in arrears in this category. I will make a point about the benefits of indebted borrowers engaging with their lenders in the context of the Central Bank's data on mortgages that have been restructured. Almost 115,000 family home mortgage accounts have been permanently restructured. Some of these may not have been in arrears. This number is approximately one in seven. Over the course of 2014, there was an increase of more than 30,000 in the number of accounts that were restructured. A significant number of mortgage accounts have been restructured, although more need to be, and a large number of borrowers have consequently been able to remain in their homes. This shows that engagement between borrowers and lenders can make a crucial difference and can pay off. This is not a criticism of borrowers. Often, people are in stressful situations. It is important that the engagement be meaningful. The Government will ensure that this issue is addressed in the new package of measures to be announced imminently. It is also worth emphasising that, even if the mortgage arrears resolution process has concluded and legal proceedings have commenced, the code of conduct on mortgage arrears requires that a lender must continue to maintain contact with the borrower and-or his or her nominated representative to see if an alternative repayment arrangement can be agreed even at that late stage. The code of conduct is an important consumer protection mechanism and compliance with it is monitored by the Central Bank. It is worth repeating that the strong view of the Government is that, in respect of co-operating borrowers under the mortgage arrears resolution process, repossession of a person's primary home should only be considered as an absolute last resort. Every effort should be made to agree an acceptable arrangement as an alternative to repossession. This is the approach that we are taking in the measures that we will shortly introduce.

The Government will make an announcement on the mortgage arrears issue in the coming weeks. It is intended that announcement will focus on initiatives aimed at reducing the number of mortgages in long-term arrears and will seek to facilitate borrowers remaining in their homes wherever possible. The constructive debate from all sides of the House has been useful in that regard.

Everyone welcomes good news and we do not want to be pessimistic, but as that debate was happening, I glanced at my telephone and saw that a family of six in Cork was sleeping in a car. This is the Ireland in which we live. We must ask ourselves where we are going as a nation. In recent months in particular, more people have approached politicians. We acknowledge the work done by Mr. David Hall, the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, and other groups. From speaking with a large number of people in recent weeks, the arrogance being shown to them by banks is unsustainable. In that time, I have gone with people to try to resolve problems, but the banks hold the cards and are telling people what to do. This cannot continue. We must put the banks into a corner and bear something in mind - when they knocked on the former Government's door in the middle of the night in their hour of need, we as a nation put €65 billion behind them. Now, when people in family homes across the country genuinely need help, the banks are giving them the two fingers. There is a fear among families. An old saying down the country is that, when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window. People are living in dire straits. The Government must consider all of the knock-on effects on families, for example, separations or something that none of us wishes to hear about, namely, suicide. It has happened. Banks have much to answer for, given their arrogance. The Government cannot just wave a magic wand and tell them to do this, that and the other.Pressure must be put on the Central Bank to ensure the banks engage in a constructive way. The priority must be to protect the family home, which is part of the fabric of Irish society and of enormous importance to all families, especially where there are young children. We talk all the time in here about what must be done to resolve housing issues in different parts of the country. I attended a meeting in Leitrim yesterday where I spoke to the local authority's housing officers, as I have done in the case of various councils. There is always discussion about building houses and so on. The reality, however, is that something might be announced in October, but by the time the greenfield site is ready, planning is secured and so on, it will probably be a year or 14 months before the project is up and running. What can we do when people are under pressure but there are no houses in which to accommodate them? There was a case in my own area where a family was evicted and, within five years, the State, through the provision of rent allowance, had paid back the price of the house, in which somebody else was now living. The Government has acknowledged the merits in Deputy Donnelly's proposals, but they need to take them on board and drive on towards a resolution of this crisis. This is a problem people on all sides of the House are encountering in their constituencies. It is a problem for every politician to solve and an issue of great urgency for the nation. I urge the Minister of State and his colleagues to work with Deputy Donnelly to get these issues resolved.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-28 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	354	I thank all Deputies for their contributions. We have had a very useful and timely debate in a context where the Government is expected to present a package of new policy measures in the coming weeks. I thank my colleagues in the Technical Group who put their names to the motion. My sense from listening to the debate tonight is that there is a great deal of good intentions on all sides of the House but also an extraordinary lack of urgency on the part of the Government. Its amendment to the motion does not scream "crisis", yet there can be no doubt that we are facing a crisis. It is a crisis that was allowed to develop by the previous Government and allowed to continue by this Administration. The international data show that the country in the eurozone that has come closest to our level of arrears is Spain. The data show, too, that our level of arrears is two and a half times that of Spain. In other words, no other country is facing this level of mortgage arrears, and that is because other countries have acted to address the issue. In Ireland, we simply have not seen enough action by Government. My colleague, Deputy Thomas Pringle, noted that the Technical Group first tabled a Private Members' motion on this issue in May 2011. Even back then we were calling for many of the measures that are being called for now, not only on this side of the House but also by Deputies opposite. The Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, will be familiar with many of the actions we are proposing because he and I were both signatories to the finance committee's report on the mortgage crisis, upon which this motion is based. I will use the remaining time available to me to address the points made by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, in his contribution. His response reflected the nub of the problem, which is that there is a lot of good intentions and a great deal of talk about schemes that are in place and attempts that have been made to address the problem but which are simply not working. The Minister of State noted that the Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the mortgage arrears crisis, which includes the mortgage arrears resolution targets. We know, however, that this process mostly resulted in the issuing of thousands of legal letters. In fact, the spike in repossession claims comes out of those targets. The Minister of State also referred to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA. That was a nice idea but there are two important points to note in regard to it. First, the original code was watered down significantly and, second, it is completely unenforceable. No lender has suffered any sanction for anything to do with the CCMA. The code is, unfortunately, largely irrelevant. The Minister of State went on to talk about the extensive recasting of the personal insolvency legislation. Every Deputy in this House knows that legislation is not working. Only a handful of cases has been brought through, as explicitly referenced in the report by the finance committee last year. There is talk of the provision of advice through the Department of Social Protection. The most useful aspect of this should have been the €250 to be paid to an accountant to provide the borrower with independent financial advice. The problem with that, however, is that the accountant is legally obliged to provide advice only on the offer made by the bank. Therefore, it is next to useless. The other measure referred to by the Minister of State was the mortgage-to-rent scheme. That initiative is a good idea, but it has never worked and it still is not working. It must be made to work. The policy objective for mortgage arrears, which is referenced in the Government's response to the motion, is very important. I have before me the report of the expert group on repossessions, which states: "The Government's paramount objective in the context of resolving the mortgage arrears problem is to keep borrowers in their home wherever feasible; repossession of private residences is a last resort where all other options have failed". That sounds good, but it does not reflect what is happening in practice. I attended a sitting of the Circuit Court last week in Bray where a repossession order was granted on a mortgage where the last payment was made just three weeks previously. Ten possession orders were granted, several of them in a context where it clearly was not the case that every conceivable option was exhausted. The Government policy in this regard makes sense, but it is not reflected in what is actually happening. The Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, made a presentation to a conference recently where he observed that there is a lack of Government policy objectives. In the absence of such objectives, the courts are being asked by legislators, in an unreasonable manner, to use their discretion. They do not know, however, what they are meant to use their discretion for. That is why I have outlined in my motion a range of additional policy measures, such as minimising socio-economic harm, avoiding repossession where possible, ensuring the dignity of all parties, ensuring equity in the resolution of debts, ensuring restructuring arrangements are sustainable for all parties, minimising rehousing needs, avoiding incentive for strategic default, ensuring adequate advice and representation for borrowers, and ensuring adequate insolvency options for borrowers. I hope the Government will consider broadening the explicit policy objectives along these lines. The Minister of State said that the CCMA provides that lenders may only commence legal proceedings for repossession where they have already made every reasonable effort to agree an alternative arrangement with a co-operating borrower. That is only useful if one can go to court with a lawyer who can say to the judge or registrar, "I am sorry, but the lender is not compliant with the CCMA". If people are turning up to court without legal representation, which most seem to do, the CCMA is irrelevant because they do not know they have those rights. Moreover, the CCMA only applies where a borrower is deemed to be co-operating. Under the legislation, the entity that deems a person to be co-operating or not co-operating is the lending bank, and the latter has fairly wide discretion as to what it deems to be non-co-operation. That is a very important point. The Minister of State went on to talk about the changes to the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, changes which I welcomed. In fact, Mr. Ross Maguire of New Beginning and I wrote a lot of those measures into my Family Home Protection (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was subsequently incorporated into the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act. The Minister of State notes that the latter gives discretion to the courts to adjourn proceedings unless every option has been considered. A personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, can come in and his or her advice will be taken on board. That is useful if the borrower has access to a PIP. In most cases, however, borrowers cannot afford to avail of the services of a PIP and Government policy does not provide for same in those circumstances. That is dealt with in the motion. We have talked about the mortgage-to-rent process. The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, stated that up to the end of 2014, 70 cases had been completed. I have pushed a few of them across the line, as I am sure have other Deputies. There are 166 Deputies in the House but only 70 cases have been completed. The process is not working. Worryingly, the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, stated that the new protocol has been reviewed and that it tries to address the acknowledged delay in the mortgage-to-rent process. The issue is not the acknowledged delays in the process. There are complexities in the process. The issue with the mortgage-to-rent scheme is that the conditions for qualification are so onerous that virtually nobody qualifies for it. Many years ago, I brought this issue to the attention of the then Minister with responsibility for this issue, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, but nothing meaningful has happened yet. The conditions for qualification must be widened if the mortgage-to-rent scheme is to work. I want to make a final point on the proposal the Government is talking about bringing forward. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, said in his response that, "It is intended that the announcement will focus on initiatives aimed at reducing the number of mortgages in long-term arrears and will seek to facilitate borrowers remaining in their homes wherever possible." That is good but it is not enough. The finance committee report, for example, suggests that a comprehensive solution must include consistency for borrowers. We all know that the first question one asks a borrower in arrears when he or she comes in seeking our help is, "Which bank is it?". If it is Bank of Ireland versus Allied Irish Banks, one is in a completely different world. That must change. There must be equity and transparency. The bankruptcy period must be reduced at least temporarily for a few years until this issue is sorted. The payment attachment order period must be reduced.  I look forward to seeing the Government proposals. The motion before the House is a comprehensive, non-political effort. It reflects the wishes of the finance committee. It also reflects what borrowers and experts in the field are saying. Had it been implemented in 2011, the mortgage crisis would now be a thing of the past. I ask the Government to please take a look at this, to implement as much of it as possible and to be more ambitious than it has been with the proposal so far.
