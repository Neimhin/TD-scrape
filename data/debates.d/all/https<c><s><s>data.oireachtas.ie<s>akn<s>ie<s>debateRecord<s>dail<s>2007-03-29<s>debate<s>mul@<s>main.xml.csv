However, I fear that what Members received last week is inadequate.  While I have discussed this matter with Mr. Maloney of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and have received certain assurances, I do not see them here.  The Tánaiste will appreciate there is a serious problem in respect of the Poolbeg Peninsula.

As for the Poolbeg Peninsula, a smell emanates from the sewage treatment plant, the Government incinerator is to go there and there is no public transport.  While I have received assurances that there will be a Luas in Sandymount and Ringsend to facilitate such development, this is the kind of issue that must be debated in detail and it should come again before the House.

While I have no objection in principle to the proposition to refer the matter for further scrutiny, there is a requirement on the Tánaiste to give a bounden guarantee that this matter will be properly addressed in the House.  Members need to know where exactly stand the Tánaiste and his colleagues in respect of the proposed developments on the Poolbeg Peninsula.  It is an extremely important issue that is not simply of local concern.  Wider concerns are involved and Members would like the opportunity to participate properly in this regard.  The Tánaiste has an opportunity to give a guarantee to Members that this will indeed be the case.

However, Dublin Bay is the most populated bay on this island and it is proposed to site an incinerator in the middle of the area to which this motion refers.  I suggest Members be mindful of that.  In referring the matter to the joint committee as undoubtedly will happen, there should be provision and recognition that if the committee so recommends, this matter should come back before the House for a full and comprehensive debate.  This would take place after those Deputies and others who may be more knowledgeable about the site have had a chance to explore in detail the concerns that have been expressed by many people.

This is why the New Heart for Dublin project has my support and that of a number of other Members.As for this matter, I agree with Deputy Quinn that having a debate now on this subject with everyone's participation would be to put the cart before the horse.  It should go to the joint committee at which an intensive discussion can be held.  Were a matter to arise from the committee's discussions that should come back before the House, this can be done.As for the proposal by Dublin City Council to have an incinerator at Poolbeg, I wish to make the point that this——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The Tánaiste was an eminent legal counsel before his election to the House and may be obliged to return to that profession shortly.  Two minutes ago, he stated in respect of the Poolbeg proposal that the matter requires intensive discussion and should go to the committee.  The Criminal Justice Bill 2007 contains 51 sections and two Schedules and 156 amendments have been tabled.  Four hours have been allocated to it, which comes to less than two minutes per amendment.  The Hogan group report was commissioned by the Tánaiste last November and produced an interim report in January on the right to silence.  However, the Hogan report itself was not published until after the publication of the Criminal Justice Bill.Over the years, the Tánaiste has rightly made a virtue of stating that legislation should be drafted and debated properly in the interest of producing good law.  This is not the way to do business and it smacks of the height of arrogance to expect that a Bill of this magnitude and import should pass through the House within four hours, without intensive discussion, as he pointed out in respect of the other matter.  This is not the way to do business and I object to the process that has been adopted by the Government in ramming this through on the basis of a pending general election.I have to hand a letter from José Manuel Barroso, who, as the Tánaiste is aware, is President of the European Commission.  I wrote to President Barroso some time ago on the issue regarding the voluntary health insurance company, VHI, and in his letter of response——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I agree entirely with Deputy Kenny's reasonable comments.  There are 156 amendments to this Bill and even allowing for almost five hours of discussion, that comes to approximately 40 amendments per hour.  One would scarcely read the amendments in that time.  While I am aware the Tánaiste has little regard for the House, I had thought he might have regard for the views publicly expressed by his colleagues at the Bar or those of the Law Society of Ireland.Moreover, it is unreasonable to ask Members who will be present in the Chamber from 10.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. without any break to focus on such a task, which experts have stated warrants serious scrutiny.  The Tánaiste is aware that the Labour Party has given support in principle for what he is attempting to do in this instance and I do not know why he wishes to deal with it in this manner.  Although the Human Rights Commission, which is a statutory body, has been unable to report on it due to lack of time, the Tánaiste is ploughing ahead regardless.  This is not the way to make law, especially having regard to some of the delicate issues concerning the liberty of the citizen and other matters that are at issue in this regard.  I ask the Tánaiste to rethink the reason the guillotine must come down today.  It is unlikely that some of the more important matters will be reached at all.In addition, a break of half an hour should be provided for during the course of the day.

However, it stands out given the large amount of comment and objections raised by people who because of their qualifications ought to be heeded.  Apparently, the Tánaiste thinks he knows better than all of them.Barristers, the Human Rights Commission, the ICCL and a range of groups specialising in this which spend a lot more time on it than any of us advise against this Bill and the way it is pushed without receiving sufficient scrutiny.  Why are other parties, not only the Tánaiste, happy to see it get the nod?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Why are we here in the first place if we do not take our job seriously and be responsible about legislation being passed, particularly when it has such serious implications?Unfortunately, not for the first time, the Tánaiste will table 40 amendments on Committee Stage and more on Report Stage.  How can we scrutinise the full gambit of amendments required?  Even at this stage, will the Tánaiste think twice about the merits of what he is doing?  As we know from the past, rushed legislation is bound to come back and haunt us in a way the Tánaiste cannot foresee.  It will cost us all in terms of its effect, the bad name which politics, and the Tánaiste's own name if he values it, will receive.  The law itself will be demeaned by this type of process.  I ask the Tánaiste to reconsider and ask all parties to bear in mind this is rushed legislation and it is not wise to proceed with it at present.

It is important to remind ourselves that protections of innocent citizens are at stake and it is not only about addressing those who are law breakers.  We are dealing with major changes that can have a dramatic effect on a situation in which any citizen could find himself or herself erroneously.There is a huge responsibility for every possible care to be employed in the evaluation of the measures being presented and that is not happening.  People of the Tánaiste's profession clearly indicated yesterday and again this morning that this is extremely dangerous, that what is at stake is of such fundamental importance within the law codes that it requires the greatest care and scrutiny.The response from the Tánaiste's office when he was not available this morning was that there have been three weeks of debates.  Bits of three days over three weeks were allocated to the address of the Criminal Justice Bill, not three weeks of debate in the House.  It was erroneous and a total misrepresentation of the situation that was reported from the Tánaiste's office on "Morning Ireland" this morning.The Tánaiste has a responsibility to withdraw the proposition to apply the guillotine and not only should it be left open-ended but the Tánaiste should withdraw the proposal to proceed to Committee Stage at this point.  There is much need for more and greater evaluation.  We concluded Second Stage only yesterday and we will see the bang of the gavel once again today with the passage of this at 3.30 p.m.  When will this stop?  Will the Tánaiste heed the appeals not only of representatives in this House but of those from within the bar profession who represent the minds of legal practitioners who say that this is wrong?  It is time to stop it.

If this were to go to a committee now, everybody knows the result would be that what was agreed last December, that an urgent need existed for legislation in this area, would remain unaddressed.Deputy Ó Caoláin spoke about the protection of the innocent.  This is precisely what I am about.  I do not want to stand at the foot of the beds of more people who were shot down in gangland events.

I am concerned about protecting the rights of the innocent.  People speak about the legislative package put before the House as if it attacks the right to silence.  It is not about removing the right to silence.  The law proposed here has been on the statute book of our neighbouring jurisdiction for 12 years and nobody stated that the right to silence was torn up.  There is a great deal of misinformation.

Yesterday, in a letter, a small minority of barristers made a good point on the repeat offences provision and I will take it on board and amend the legislation to reflect that.

I wrote to the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, who responded by letter recently.  He stated:Having examined the situation, on 25 January, the Commission launched a formal infringement procedure against Ireland for possible breach of Community Law, in particular of the Third Non-Life Directive (infringement procedure 2006/5023).  The objective of this procedure is to obtain a change of the present rules in Ireland so as to ensure a level playing field and to restore fair competition in the Irish health insurance market.Does the Government propose to introduce legislation arising from the comments of the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Commissioner McCreevy, and the implications of the Commission President's reply?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	88	It is intended to publish legislation on the voluntary health insurance market this session.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Health and Children is due to receive in the next few days the report of the Barrington group, which has been examining this issue.  The opinions of the Commissioner and the President of the Commission will be taken into account by the Government in the context of the legislation.

It was debated on the Adjournment last night after being raised by Deputies McCormack, Michael D. Higgins and others.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Surely it is not acceptable that our citizens are being poisoned by the public water supply.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I suggest the Deputy raise the issue in the appropriate way.  The Chair will facilitate him, but I ask him to return to the Order of Business.  Members have complained about time not being available to debate the next issue.  We cannot take up the Order of Business with an omnibus question time.

The Minister is available to deal with parliamentary questions.  It is open to Members opposite to raise the issue in the time available to them.  This is a matter for the local authority and, as I understand the points made by my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, resources have been made available to the local authority for a considerable period.

Has the Government considered the Bills it needs to have passed or will they all be allowed to drop?  There are 12 Bills in question, namely, the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006, the Criminal Justice Bill, the Control of Exports Bill 2007, the Credit Union Savings Protection Bill 2007, the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Bill 2005, the Defamation Bill 2006, the Fines Bill 2007, the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service Bill 2002, the Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006, the Registration of Wills Bill 2005 and the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005.

However, the Bill has not been published.  What is the delay in the Bill?  On a related matter, the Taoiseach has indicated he wants to hold the general election on a Thursday, which would not facilitate students.

I am sure the Tánaiste is aware that bills have been issued to the parents of mentally handicapped children and young adults who are staying in sheltered housing, requiring them to pay all their weekly income except for €35.  That is being done under the nursing home charges legislation.  Has the statutory instrument enabling this to take place been laid before the House?  What is the position with it?  I understand that a statutory instrument would have been required, but I cannot find it.

It is now proposed to consider the Bill until 3.30 p.m. without giving those who are dealing with it an opportunity to leave the Chamber.  That is not reasonable.  I ask the Chair, who has health and safety responsibilities, to ensure that provision is made for Members to take a 30-minute break, during which we can take advice on issues and have a cup of tea.  Some of us have been here since early morning to prepare for the debate because it was not possible to prepare for it further in advance.  We did not get the consolidated list of amendments until this morning.

As the Fine Gael spokesman on enterprise, I would be prepared to delay the starting time of the debate on the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007 from 3.30 p.m. to 4 p.m., to facilitate the spending of the necessary additional time on the Criminal Justice Bill 2007.

Two years passed before the Government initiated the Committee Stage debate on the Bill, which has not yet been enacted.  When is it envisaged that the Bill will be enacted?  Does the Tánaiste agree that the delay in introducing the water treatment facility in Galway is directly linked to the delay in the enactment of this legislation, which would have allowed that facility to be pursued as a public private partnership?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 5, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following subsection:"(3) An order under subsection (2) in respect of section 11 may not be made until the Minister is satisfied as to the technical accuracy of the technology required to operate that section.”.I preface my remarks, as invited by the Ceann Comhairle, by stating this is an unreasonable way of dealing with legislation.  I checked until 7.30 p.m. last night but a consolidated list of amendments was not available.  Through the hard work of the Bills Office, it was available in electronic format at that point but the printed version was not available until this morning.  I am working from the electronic version I received last night.  This is unsatisfactory.  The inadequate consideration of the Bill is illustrated by the comments made by the Minister on the Order of Business.  He stated he was willing to accept amendments submitted in writing by external lawyers and that he was willing to amend the Bill on foot of representations he received.  Members have not seen them and I do not know what points external bodies will make.  Sections of the Bill will not be reached in the debate in this House and important parts will be backloaded into the Bill.  I have enjoyed the Minister accepting amendments and debating issues as he normally does.  The structure of this debate does not lend itself to such a procedure because we are not at the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and do not have time.  Whole sections of the Bill will not be debated.  That we will have a debate on Report Stage on which the confines of the debate will be much narrower is no excuse.The amendment seeks to insert in section 1 a subsection relating to the electronic tagging of individuals afforded bail.  We will deal with that issue in some detail when we come to section 11.  I raised this matter on Second Stage.  The Minister outlined the two forms of electronic tagging — a fixed location tagging system, whereby an individual is monitored in respect of his or her proximity to a particular point, used in respect of a curfew for example, and the global monitoring system which is better in monitoring the location of an individual.  The latter does not work effectively, as the Minister has stated.  During the debate on the Criminal Justice Act 2006 the Minister indicated that there were difficulties in respect of a tagged individual's proximity to tall buildings, high trees, low cloud and in certain climatic conditions.  I asked if there had been remarkable changes in the technology since we last debated the matter in May.  I did not receive a direct reply but do not believe there has been.  If electronic tagging is not to be seen as a token gesture, there must be satisfaction that the technology works in advance of bringing the section into operation.  If the view is that the section is not operational, the courts will not rely on it and this will be another example of legislation that sounds good but has no effect.  The import of my amendment is that we can be confident the technology works and the courts can be satisfied that, if they resort to electronic tagging, it will work.  They will not have resort to it if they believe it will not work.  Even if the Minister is well disposed towards using the technology, affirmation would be helpful in that regard.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I have been associated with the view in favour of electronic tagging for a long time.  I supported its inclusion in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  It was included, despite the reservations of the Minister.  I advocate a provision to allow discretion for judges to release people on bail subject to electronic tagging.  If there is a choice between keeping a person in custody and releasing him or her, it is preferable to release the person if one has a reasonable assurance that he or she will not commit further crimes.  Considering the 5,000 headline offences committed every year by those on bail, electronic tagging is a way to apply technology in pursuit of the public policy on the prevention of crime.  I see a role for electronic tagging, particularly in respect of an assurance that a person will not commit further offences while on bail.  One must consider the link between the policy, the statutory provisions and judges' discretion and practical implementation.  I seek an explanation from the Minister.  I sensed a reluctance on his part to accept electronic tagging, particularly in comments made during debate on the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The points raised by Deputy Howlin from the viewpoint of implementation certainly deserve a full answer.  Essentially I want to know what the Minister has done as regards making provision for electronic tagging in a practical sense.  It is not as if this was brand new technology.  My understanding is that electronic tagging has been in operation since 1984, when it began in Canada.  Since then it has become a common feature in many jurisdictions, including Australia, many states in the US, in Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands.  It is a common feature of the criminal justice system in many countries.  The question is why Ireland has not got it since we went through this process in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which eventually became law last July, if we now propose to enable judges to have the discretion to release people on bail subject to monitoring.The system of house curfew is well established in other countries, is inexpensive and can be readily and easily put into operation in Ireland.  Half a loaf is better than no bread.  If that is possible why can measures not be put in place so that as soon as it is cleared through the Oireachtas, hopefully after proper debate, judges can immediately make orders pursuant to its provisions?  I want to hear the Minister's views on house curfew.  Can we immediately make that system operative and on general monitoring, which involves tracking the movements of people, what is the up-to-date situation in terms of the technology involved?  I accept that is more difficult and that there are deficiencies in this area.  How far has the Minister gone with that particular aspect?If we are taking electronic monitoring on board as part of our public policy from the viewpoint of crime prevention in particular, obviously the implementation process is of great importance and I should like to hear an up-to-date report on that from the Minister.

I am opposed to tagging of people on bail, as I opposed the tagging of released prisoners as a system for keeping track of people who have been convicted.  Greater investment in the probation and welfare system would probably serve much better those who have been convicted and it would be more cost effective.  I argued that matter when this was being discussed in the previous Bill.  We argued against going beyond that, as did the Minister.  Several months later, however, he is presenting proposals to the House on something he has argued against and about which he had major concerns last year.  I do not see what has happened in the meantime to change his or anybody else's mind in that regard.I find it strange that my amendments were ruled out of order as being contrary to the purpose of the Bill.  My intention was to ensure that if this Bill, as enacted, was to come into operation, it would be conditional on the proposals I tabled in those amendments.  This amendment also has an element of conditionality attached and yet it was accepted so that is bizarre.  The conditionalities I mentioned are reasonable and if the Minister is open to accepting or debating reasonable amendments, he should look at them, despite their being ruled out of order, and perhaps consider taking them on board for Report Stage.  We have passed several laws since I became a Member of the House, which I believe were retrograde.  They have not been operational for a sufficient length of time for us to be able to form an opinion as to their effectiveness, yet the Minister is extending some of those provisions in this legislation.  At the outset, we should see whether previous legislation is being used and is effective.  If it is not effective, we should look at it.  I do not believe that most of the provisions passed last year under the Criminal Justice Act have been used.   The Minister might present the evidence he has in support of his position to the House so that we may, on the basis of some facts and figures, decide on the way forward.I outlined on Second Stage my virtual total opposition to this Bill.  There are some slight parts that I accept, but in total this is not the way forward.  If the Minister wishes to tackle gangland and drugs related crime head on, he would do much better to ensure that members of the Garda Síochána can communicate with each other by radio rather than personal telephones.  They should have access to the Internet at each station and stations should be of a proper habitable quality.  Rooms, including interrogation centres in stations, should be fully equipped and operational for video recording.There should be a greater presence of community gardaí.  There is a problem within the Garda, because it is difficult to get serving officers to remain as community gardaí as it is not considered sexy enough or whatever.  That culture within the Garda Síochána needs to change because one of the most effective ways of tackling crime is to increase public confidence in the Garda and to promote greater interaction with gardaí in the community.  Enormous strides have been made in this regard.  Community gardaí have worked very well, for example, in Cherry Orchard, on the development council etc.   In time the reward for this type of work will come.  It might not come quickly enough for the Minister, nor, regrettably, for some of the victims of crime, but it is coming because there is a slight change in the manner in which the Garda Síochána is tackling the problem.If the Minister was listening to the Garda and read Garda Review, a copy of which I got yesterday, time and again the call is there for more resources and equipment, but not necessarily more laws.  The laws are there to be used, but they cannot be used because gardaí cannot get past the first stage, which is about communicating with each other and perhaps the public.  At this stage, on section 1 in particular, I ask the Minister to look at my amendments, even though they have been ruled out of order.  These amendments propose that some of these sections, such as the treatment of persons in Garda custody, do not come into effect until the regulations are independently reviewed.  A similar needs analysis must be done of different parts of the justice system.  For instance, no needs analysis has been done of An Garda Síochána although Kathleen O’Toole has begun one.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Deputy Howlin is proposing there should be a precondition for the commencement of section 11, that is an independent assessment of the viability by the Minister of the electronic monitoring system.  Deputy Howlin's amendment is not necessary because the provisions in sections 13 and 16 mean that electronic monitoring will not come into operation until an arrangement is made between the Minister and a contractor for the operation of the system.  That must be done with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  As Deputy Howlin knows, I am unlikely to get the consent of the Minister for Finance for a system that would not work.  Preconditions are already in place that imply Deputy Howlin's point.I agree with the spirit of his amendment.  Before a system is introduced, it must be workable.  Section 13 makes it clear that for it to be workable there must be an arrangement with a contractor for which I need the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Only then can I make regulations for the operation of the system.  There are a series of jumps that must be cleared before the system can come into operation.There has already been a discussion on electronic monitoring on Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The global positioning system, GPS, which monitors actual location has been the subject of controversy in the United Kingdom and has not been satisfactory in its operation.  The home-based curfew type device has also been in operation and has been more satisfactory, although not 100% so.I agree with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe that even if GPS is not available, we can go ahead with the curfew system.  Before such a monitoring system can be introduced, I must have an agreement with a contractor for its monitoring.  I am not deploying gardaí to study monitors.  The panoply of this set of provisions is conditions precedent for the operation of the systems.  I will not commence these sections until a court is in a position to have compliance with its orders in this regard.  There will not be a situation where a District Court judge in Clonakilty orders electronic monitoring, only to be told by the Garda there is no system in place.  There must be a system in place before the courts can order its use.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Section 13 is the standard provision for the consent of the Minister for Finance regarding contracts.  I tabled the amendment to tease out where these monitoring systems stand.  I admit I am not a technician.  Since my comments on GPS, I have had several e-mails from people who use it satisfactorily for jogging.My concern is that this is part of a window-dressing package.  The Minister claims these systems will be introduced but only when they work.  They never may but it is useful to have a nice, robust-sounding package together, capturing some ideas put forward by among others, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, to make the Minister look good running into the election.  Maybe mine is a particularly cynical view.  Last year on Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, the Minister declared his enthusiasm was waning for these same proposals.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The Minister also discussed the same provision for electronic tagging.  GPS is captured by this provision.  One could also argue the enabling provision be included in the Bill and, if GPS ever becomes 100% accurate, the legislative base is intact.Is there a costing for these systems?  Last year, the Minister referred to a sum of €1,500 for monitoring.  Yet, any system that requires 24-hour monitoring is not going to come cheap.  The other side of the argument is that keeping an individual in prison is not a cheap option with the costs of incarceration ranging between €90,000 and €140,000 per annum.I would have preferred if we had the views of the Irish Human Rights Commission before dealing with these provisions.  There would be a great reluctance on the part of any court to confine someone to prison regarding a bail application unless there was a compelling reason.  It may be more pro forma to electronically tag an individual.  That is a significant infringement of one’s civil liberties and the courts may have a much greater readiness to do so.The concern arises, however, that more people may have some curtailment placed on their civil liberties through tagging when the basic principle of law that should apply is that people are innocent until proven guilty and should have their liberty fully vindicated until such time as they are convicted in a court of law of an unlawful offence.  Somewhere between these two propositions, there is the common good.  The common good is not served by serial re-offenders being at liberty.  That is why the bail issue must be dealt with separately.I am cautious on this matter.  Does the technology work?  How much will it cost?  Will it be operated in a way that ensures it is still considered a significant curtailment of liberty?  It should not become a matter of routine even when it is introduced.  Electronic tagging by GPS or fixed-point tagging, which confines people to certain locations within certain hours, must be carefully evaluated for its effect and never become a matter of routine.  Has the Minister considered that electronic tagging may become seen as a small enough matter and would be resorted to with much greater frequency than a refusal of bail and a confinement to prison?  In such a scenario, does the Minister consider it might imbalance the rights of an individual who is accused but not convicted to his or her full liberty?
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I am shocked by the Minister's response.  The issue of electronic tagging has already being debated during the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Amendments at the time, some of which I was involved with, provided for a process whereby, on a post-release basis from custody, a judge could order a criminal to be electronically tagged for a certain period.  Apparently nothing whatever has been done by the Minister to implement the provisions dealing with electronic tagging already in place under the last Bill covering this area.  Since the last Bill was enacted I have pushed to extend its provisions to cover giving a judge the option to release a person on bail subject to electronic monitoring.  It was not included in the earlier proposal from the Minister but it is included in the Bill, about which I am delighted, although I wonder why he included it.  Was it solely because I proposed it and to stop me giving out about it——

The Minister has accepted that pressure has been exerted very much by me and the Fine Gael Party on this issue to provide for the necessary statutory underpinning, but apparently he has done nothing to implement it.I do not intend to go over the ground of outlining the benefits of electronic tagging but responding to this issue, as someone possibly more committed to it than the Minister is, to some of the comments made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh, I am talking about an alternative to custody.  We can give judges power to release a person on bail with a reasonable assurance that he or she will be tracked to ensure that he or she will not commit further crimes while awaiting trail.  It also has other significant benefits, which have been manifested in other countries.  This system has allowed a person to sustain his or her employment, rather than be detained in custody.  I saw a person, who was released in the UK and electronically tagged, play a first division soccer match.  It was highlighted in the media.  He was able to continue doing his job.  The system also results in huge savings for the taxpayer.  Deputy Howlin mentioned that it costs €2,000 a week, on average, to keep a person in prison.  This system releases custodial places which are in short supply and relieves pressure on the custodial system.  Therefore, it has advantages from the point of view of post-release programmes and bail.I believe I am wasting my breath in trying to convince the Minister to include such a provision in legislation when, apparently, he has not raised a finger to make sure that it will operate.  What kind of an approach is that?  I find it utterly unacceptable.  While I am happy to see the legislative provisions in place, I am entirely unhappy about this approach making any contribution towards the fight against crime when the Minister has not raised a finger to implement the provisions, not only those of this Bill but those of the last Criminal Justice Bill enacted into law by the Oireachtas last July.

We discussed the accuracy of the technology of such a system last year.  If we were to go down the road of introducing a tagging system, it is reasonable that at the very least not only its accuracy but its effectiveness would be proven.  There are other proven alternatives to tagging such as resourcing the courts, making sure that there are not long delays in the hearing of court cases, and that the conditions of bail can be set by judges which would allow the probation and welfare service to monitor them or the Garda Síochána to ensure that those on bail do not breach their bail conditions.  However, that has not been done and neither the Garda Síochána nor the probation and welfare service has been properly resourced to ensure that bail conditions are complied with.

It might well occur to a judge dealing with the question of whether a person is likely to commit a serious gangland crime that the fact that he or she could or could not be GPS monitored might affect the judge's decision although, on the other hand, if a person is a serious criminal, his or her physical location may be less relevant than others.  However, if one is lower down in the pecking order, where one goes and what one does is probably of significance.I make the point that the system is not entirely cost free.

I remember that happening at the time of the previous Criminal Justice Bill but I am not in a position to say where consideration of it has got to since then, but the system involved cost implications, putting out a contract and having a statutory basis for it.  The idea of outsourcing it was an issue which had to be dealt with in order to make it effective.  That is what this is about.I point out to Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Howlin that I am not being cynical about this.  While this system is not enthusiastically supported by some Members, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe is enthusiastic that this should be done.  I accept the case he is making but I want to make it clear that there is no point in pretending to District Court judges or others that I have the answer to it, until I have an effective technology and a contractor in Ireland who can show, just as in regard to digital radio, that he or she can deliver the service.  There is no point in my splashing out on a contract and then judges saying the system is ridiculous and does not work.

I am convinced that we need to give reassurances that such a system will work and the proposal in this amendment is a way of doing that.  It would give some imperative to the Minister if he were to provide for this in legal terms in that we should have some follow up on it because it appears there has not been any such follow up.  The Minister said his officials met Home Office officials last year and he is not aware of anything happening on this since then.  Clearly, very little, if anything, has happened since the 2004 Act came into force last year.  The notion of extending it to other categories, to bail applicants, when we have done nothing about last year's category, post-release persons, seems to be window dressing.  That is reality as I see it.  Therefore, I am pressing my amendment.

In page 6, subsection (2), line 22, after "failure" to insert "or refusal".These amendments deal with repeals of legislation in section 3 of the Bill.  This section repeals certain parts of enactments in Schedule 1 which are section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996, and section 5 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  I am advised these amendments will lend clarity.  The Minister's amendment wants those provisions to have force in so far as they relate to the failure to mention facts at the time before this repeal came into operation.  The sentence is not comprehensive.  Failure or refusal, as opposed to passive failure, should also be covered.  The active refusal as well as passive failure to mention should be captured by the provision.  It is a simple technical redrafting to expand the saving clause that the Minister is proposing to insert when he is repealing those sections.

I appreciate the Deputy is being consistent with proposals he intends making to Part 4 of the Bill but that would be with regard to new law.  I can shorten this matter by saying that as far as we are concerned, every failure includes a refusal.  If a person is asked to do X or to account for X and the person refuses to do so, that is a failure just as much as sitting there and staring at the wall and not giving an explicit refusal.  We do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendments regarding a refusal and for that reason and for the other reason that the two Acts only refer to failure, I do not propose to accept this amendment.

There is no point in amending something that is not stated or restating something that is not stated.  I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.

In page 6, before section 5, but in Part 1, to insert the following new section:"PART 2QUASHING OF AN ACQUITTAL5.—(1) The Director may apply to the Central Criminal Court for an order—(a) quashing a person's acquittal for a stated offence, and(b) ordering that he or she shall be retried in respect of that offence.(2) On an application under subsection (1), the court shall—(a) if satisfied that the requirements of sections 6* and 7** are met, make the order applied for, or(b) otherwise, dismiss the application.This proposal arises out of one of the recommendations of the criminal law review group which reported this week.  One of the recommendations of this group was to do with the re-opening of acquittals following new evidence.  I know from my days as a law student and as a practitioner of the old principle of double jeopardy, whereby once an acquittal was granted, the person was free.  I have noticed that changes have been made in recent years in the UK and other jurisdictions.  The change arises where new and fresh evidence becomes available which was not available at the time of the trial and which points to the guilt of the person who was accused of a serious offence and who was acquitted at the time.The recommendations of the Hogan committee arise in the context in which the power which I am proposing in my amendment of quashing an acquittal would be used very rarely and only used following the new evidence becoming available or an allegation of trial tampering.  It would not be used often but it would be an important part of the criminal justice system to have this power to deal with somebody who was guilty of a serious offence and who effectively got away with it.  I am proposing that the jury acquittal can in certain limited circumstances in the case of serious offences such as murder and rape and other heinous crimes, be re-opened.In tabling this amendment I am reinforced by the recommendation of the Hogan committee.  It is a ludicrous situation that a Criminal Justice Bill is being proceeded with without taking into account the recommendations of such a high-powered committee chaired by such an eminent lawyer, Dr. Gerard Hogan.  I certainly take note of the committee's recommendation.It was not a question of sitting up all night when it came to drafting these amendments but rather of looking at the British precedent and its outcome.  It is already in operation in the UK under the Criminal Justice Act and the sections in the Bill before the House largely follow the format of the British Act.  The thinking is to give the power to the DPP to apply to the Central Criminal Court for an order quashing the acquittal and leaving open the possibility of a new trial with new and compelling evidence.  I have in mind here advances in modern technology such as those relating to the collection of DNA evidence.  If DNA evidence was not available at a trial but if it subsequently became available and pointed to the guilt of the person who was accused and then acquitted, surely there must be an argument in favour of, at the very least, reopening the case.  I accept this would be subject to all the relevant safeguards recommended in the Criminal Law Review Group's report, namely, an exacting threshold, advance judicial approval for an application and a setting aside of an acquittal before a retrial could commence.  The mechanism I am suggesting would only be used on rare occasions.  Having it in the armoury would, however, strengthen the criminal justice system.According to the Criminal Law Review Group's report, there has already been one conviction in the UK, namely, in the case of Regina v. Dunlop last year.  In the case in question, a murderer who had been acquitted following two trials subsequently made admissions in which he clearly accepted responsibility for the death of the unfortunate woman who had been killed.  The latter led to the use of the type of mechanism I have outlined in the UK and the man’s acquittal was set aside and he was retried on the new evidence and convicted of murder.The Criminal Law Review Group's report also gives us the benefit of its members' views on the European Convention on Human Rights.  Anything we do must remain within the terms of both the Constitution and the convention.  This issue has been analysed by the Criminal Law Review Group and its recommendation arises on the basis that any such proposal here is both constitutional and in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.One of the reasons I wanted a decent examination of our criminal justice system and the allocation of a reasonable amount of time in which to debate these issues is to ensure that proposals of this nature are properly assessed, analysed and, if appropriate, included in the legislation.  I rest my case in respect of the amendments and I await the views of other Members.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	311	While I share the high regard for Dr. Hogan and his work, I must state the two amendments tabled in my name are identical to those I tabled in respect of the 2004 legislation.  Dr. Hogan was certainly minded to consider the points raised in amendments Nos. 121 and 122.  He was probably influenced in this regard by Mr. Humphreys who helped me draft the original proposals that are replicated in the amendments.Amendment No. 121 is an exact copy of an amendment I tabled in respect of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and it deals with miscarriages of justice resulting in acquittal.  There are cases where new evidence arises in respect of miscarriages of justice regarding convictions and where such convictions can be overturned.  There is, however, no provision in law where when compelling evidence of the most heinous and serious crimes comes to light, it is possible to launch a retrial.  The phrase "In the case of an accused person tried on indictment for an offence carrying a maximum or mandatory sentence of life imprisonment" is used in amendment No. 121 and, therefore, I am suggesting the provision would apply to a limited category of cases and that the normal double jeopardy rule would not apply because that would be grossly unfair and wrong.  The potential of being retried cannot be left to hang over everybody for ever.Amendment No. 121 suggests that in the most serious offences in respect of which life imprisonment should be the penalty, where there is an acquittal and where, at any time following such an acquittal, the DPP comes into possession of significant new evidence which demonstrates that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, he or she may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal for an order setting aside the acquittal and directing a retrial.  I argued this point last year and referred to the UK proposals put forward at that time — these were not then enacted — particularly as they relate to technical advances.  I suppose many of us are fans of the television programme "Crime Scene Investigations".  While the advances to which I refer may not be as fanciful as some of those put forward in that programme, there have been clear technological advances in respect of DNA evidence and other matters through which very strong evidence of guilt can be adduced.  In circumstances where a court did not have the benefit of evidence such as that to which I refer, it may have acquitted an individual who was guilty of awful crimes such as the murder or rape of children or the murder of another adult.  That individual would be set free because the State and its prosecution services were powerless to act upon compelling evidence of his or her guilt.  As already stated, the position regarding the overturning of wrongful convictions in high-profile cases is clear.  There must be the potential — I accept the grounds in this regard would have to be narrowly focused — to revisit cases in respect of which new and compelling evidence relating to serious crimes comes to light.The Minister may recall that when we debated this matter last year, he indicated an extremely positive view towards my suggestion in this regard.  It is ironic that the main concern then was that there would not be sufficient time to tease the matter out properly.  It was agreed that we would revisit it on a future occasion when another criminal justice measure came before the House.  Such a measure has come before the House but my suggested provision is not contained in it.  It would have been included in the legislation if we had been given the normal amount of time necessary to debate the legislation.  If there had been sufficient time to review Dr. Hogan's report, the relevant recommendation would have migrated from that report into the legislative proposal before us.It is not too late to make provision in this regard.  The form of words in the amendment is good and robust and suggests a limited change to the current position, under which there is an absolute prohibition on double jeopardy, to allow us the potential to revisit the most serious of cases in respect of which new and compelling evidence arises.  I do not know whether the Minister recalls that one of things that recommended this change to me was that in a case where somebody had committed a terrible offence and where the evidence was not sufficiently compelling to convince either a jury or court of his or her guilt, there would always be a nagging belief that one day proof would become available.  There is some semblance of satisfaction in knowing that somebody who committed an awful crime that could carry life imprisonment would never be completely free of the shadow of that crime and that at some future date a charge could be proved against him or her.Amendment No. 122 is an exact replica of another amendment I tabled last year.  It arises out of clear examples that arose in respect of interference with juries.  In a case where someone is acquitted and where it subsequently becomes clear that the jury was tampered with or intimidated, said acquittal is unsafe and there should be some mechanism to overturn it.  Amendment No. 122 states:42.—(1) In the case of an accused person tried on indictment for an offence, who has been acquitted, where at any time following such acquittal the Director of Public Prosecutions comes into possession of evidence which demonstrates that interference with the jury has occurred, he or she may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal for an order setting aside the acquittal and directing a retrial.(2) A retrial under this section shall be conducted by a special criminal court unless the Director of Public Prosecutions certifies that the ordinary courts are satisfactory for such retrial.There are three elements in this amendment.  First, where somebody has been acquitted of a serious crime and it becomes abundantly clear to the DPP that the jury has been got at, there is a mechanism to revisit that.  Second, that evidence would have to be put before the Court of Criminal Appeal and that court would have to be satisfied as to it, which involves a significant burden of proof.  Third, if there was any fear that one could not get a jury that would not be subject to such intimidation, and some crime gangs' reach is such that might be the case, a special criminal court would be available for the hearing of such cases unless the Court of Criminal Appeal determined otherwise.  That is a good, strong, important mechanism and, as I did last year, I recommend it to the Minister for inclusion in this Bill.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I am very sympathetic to the spirit of both of these amendments.  I indicated that previously and I am not just saying so now.  It is my view that if somebody is the subject of a conviction by reason of a miscarriage of justice, we should supply remedies for him or her.  Likewise, it is my strong view that if somebody secured an acquittal by certain forms of miscarriage of justice, particularly tampering with a jury, or tampering with witnesses for that matter, he or she should be subject to the stricture that if he or she procured a mistrial by an unlawful act, he or she must face the prospect of retrial, in certain serious cases at any rate.  I indicated that when Deputy Howlin raised this in the context of the Criminal Justice Act of last year and I also indicated that in the context of a speech I made in Limerick in October last year.  It was one of the matters I put on the agenda of the Hogan group for consideration and I note what that group has stated on these matters.My mind has not altered one bit about this, just in case anybody thinks I am being inconsistent.  Every time I discussed this in public I stated I believe this to be a desirable change in the law.Whereas I share the view of Deputies Howlin and Jim O'Keeffe on this matter, it is not entirely free from controversy.  I do not think, especially having listened to remarks from people from the fringes in the past few days, this would go without controversy.  At the very least, we would need to have a significant debate on this issue, and to look at the constitutional implications of double jeopardy, before we go down that route.I have been accused by people of trying to rush something through without adequate thought or adequate preparation for it.  The Hogan report is an extremely valuable document and whereas I do not agree with every word of it, I agree with the significant bulk of what is in it and in some areas I would go further.I took the trouble last Saturday to go to a seminar run in the Bar Council's premises and expressed all these views to a meeting of barristers.  I thought that at least while I was present there was unanimity on these matters, although afterwards I discovered that some learned speakers came from different parts of the country and disagreed with the principle of some of the matters I am recommending.  That being the case, I am confronted with the following choice: do I stop this now and have a widespread debate on the Hogan report, or do I proceed with this Bill which is narrower in focus.

From where does Deputy Howlin think the Hogan report and all the consideration therein came?  It came from the actions that I took to put this matter on the agenda and the other matters that are there.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	315	But the Minister still has not got a fixed view on it.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	318	This will be the subject matter of debate in the context of the forthcoming general election.  The negative views, for instance, that the Green Party and Sinn Féin have to much of this material should be played out in public.  Groups like the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, and perhaps the Irish Human Rights Commission may well have difficulties with the Hogan report, even though the Hogan group consulted with them.  There is a public debate on many of these issues.My view is entirely coincident with the view of Deputies Howlin and Jim O'Keeffe.  It is not sustainable in this day and age that if a person gets away with a crime, so to speak, and there is compelling evidence afterwards which was not available at the time the person was acquitted that he or she is the guilty party, and the crime is of such seriousness as to require revisiting, one should simply state that is a question of double jeopardy or autrefois acquit and there is no issue to be gone into.  It is interesting that the European Convention on Human Rights — it is in the report, in the passage referred to by Deputy O’Keeffe — specifically deals with this territory.  It is also of significance that Ireland is increasingly out of kilter with common law consensus on this issue in having the old system where if a person is acquitted that is the end of the matter.I agree completely with Deputy Howlin.  First, it could have a general deterrent effect that people would know even if they did get away with it, and they were clever on the day, had clever lawyers and intimidated people and whatever, that in the end there were other people who could, by delivering an envelop into the DPP one day, have them back behind bars, and that accomplices could pull the plug on people at a later stage.  That is a compelling argument for change in the law on this area, as is the sheer question of public faith in the entire judicial system.  For instance, if somebody in a Myra Hindley type case were to be acquitted, and if it were subsequently to emerge that there was a video tape of them doing whatever they did and if there was incontrovertible evidence that their acquittal was mistaken, it would outrage public opinion that they would be able to walk free.  Although I do not want to get into too much detail, there is the spectacle in America of persons writing books about how they could have committed the murder if they had committed the murder of which they were acquitted.  That process, too, is deeply subversive of public confidence in the administration of justice.Ireland should join the international consensus and qualify the principle, which was a cornerstone when I was studying law, of the sanctity of double jeopardy.  We can and should qualify that principle.The issue with which I am confronted this morning by this amendment being tendered is that I am being asked to do something which I am being condemned for doing in other contexts.  I am being asked to make a radical change when there has not been debate.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	322	The pair of us having a conversation in a committee room does not of itself constitute a national debate.  The point we must bear in mind is that if I were to accede to all of the amendments that have been tabled for the implementation of the Hogan report, I would be doing precisely what all of these bodies have been saying to me I should not do, that is, take radical steps in the course of disposition of this legislation without time for people to consider all the implications of it.Deputy Howlin may ask why I am bringing in provisions to deal with the inferences on the right to silence.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	323	We will deal with that.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	324	We will deal with that at a later stage.  The distinction I draw is that we made such a provision in 1998, as well as a provision on drug trafficking offences, whereas since 1994 it has been the general law in the United Kingdom that a jury can draw an inference from a failure to mention a fact.  That has been in operation for the past 12 years.  I am confronted by the immediate problem that gangland suspects in detention rightly believe that unless they are tried for one of the two statutory exceptions, their silence has no implication whatsoever.  That is currently happening in respect of persons arrested and questioned, and I have to take immediate action in that context.I am not abrogating the right to silence.  That right is internationally recognised but nowhere except, perhaps, Ireland and the United States, is it prohibited to draw inferences from a failure to mention certain matters.  Internationally understood, the right to silence is that nobody can be compelled on punishment to incriminate him or herself or risk a prosecution due to a failure to answer a question which would be incriminating.  That is the meaning of the right to silence.  It is bogus for some people in Ireland who pretend to be knowledgeable or stress their status as practitioners to claim otherwise. It is not an abrogation of the right to silence to say that someone can exercise it but may face implications by doing so.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Minister will not be welcomed back to the Bar after the election if he continues in that vein.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I am grateful to those barristers who wrote to me but, as far as I am concerned, they got it wrong with regard to the right to silence and other issues.  They got it right in that successive burglaries should not trigger three quarter sentences and I intend to deal with that issue.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I am not making a Second Stage speech.  Deputy Howlin raised a question on barristers and I am simply saying that the view is held by a small minority of barristers who had sought a general signature to their proposition.  The great majority of barristers may not share their views on the right to silence.  I imagine the majority of barristers share the general view that the right to silence is not unlawfully curtailed by drawing an inference from its exercise in certain circumstances.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I am not sure what way the Minister wants this.  He curtailed a debate, yet claims we cannot adopt a proposal with which he agrees in principle because we will not have sufficient time for debate.  This is incredible stuff.  He now says we should not consider my proposal, which is synchronised with a similar proposal from Deputy Howlin, because it would cause controversy.  I would find that incredible coming from any Minister but it is particularly hard to accept from him.His reference to the general election also causes me concern.  Did he disclose his real intentions for this Bill?  I understood we were making an honest effort to improve the criminal justice system by introducing measures that would put us in a better position to fight the appalling levels of crime afflicting this country.  Are we instead tinkering around with the Minister's election campaign?  He might clarify that.I am focussing on improving the criminal justice system on the basis of a Bill which was put before the House by the Minister but which I think can be improved.  We are not discussing a new idea because this issue has been considered as long ago as 1982 by Mr. Justice Walsh in the O'Shea case, who stated: "It would be totally abhorrent if a conviction which had been obtained by improper means, such as the corruption or coercion of a jury, should be allowed to stand, it would be equally abhorrent if an acquittal obtained by the same methods should be allowed to stand."  It is therefore not a new principle to say that, in certain limited circumstances, acquittals improperly obtained should be questioned.With regard to the Constitution, the report of the Criminal Law Review Group states: "for the reasons outlined by Walsh J. in O'Shea, there is no public interest in preserving as inviolable a jury verdict which has been tainted by interference with the trial process".  That would involve either tampering or a failure to produce compelling and virtually conclusive evidence.  The report continues:Instead the overwhelming public interest is in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted, in the words of Article 38.1 of the Constitution ‘in due course of law.'  For the reasons outlined by Walsh J., the Review Group considers that there can be no fundamental constitutional or principled objection to revisiting jury acquittals which were brought about by or influenced by interference of an unlawful kind with the trial process.I have not yet had the opportunity to read the report of the Human Rights Commission but I do not doubt it would have no problem on this issue because the European Convention on Human Rights touches on it.  Article 4 of the convention states:1. No one shall be liable to be tried or punished again in criminal proceedings under the jurisdiction of the same State for an offence for which he has already been finally acquitted or convicted in accordance with the law and penal procedure of that State.2. The provisions of the preceding paragraph shall not prevent the reopening of the case in accordance with the law and penal procedure of the State concerned, if there is evidence of new or newly discovered facts, or if there has been a fundamental defect in the previous proceedings, which could affect the outcome of the case.Jurisprudence and the Constitution are therefore on the side of proceeding with this proposal.  The European Convention on Human Rights specifically permits it and the review group recommends it.  Deputy Howlin and I, subject to agreeing the procedure, want it and the Minister now informs us he wants it.  Why can we not have it?  The Minister says it is because it could cause controversy but I am prepared to justify the introduction of such a provision anywhere.  I am not attempting to play the hard man or electioneer but believe it would be an improvement to our criminal justice system.  I cannot understand the approach being taken by the Minister.  If he accepts it would be an improvement to the criminal justice system, as I gather from his remarks, why in the name of goodness do we not proceed with it?  That is the purpose of debate and the reason why we learned the views of the review group.  The Minister was given a clear indication by this side of the House that we want a provision of this kind, yet he stops at the brink and says it would cause controversy.  I cannot accept that as a reason for failing to proceed with the provision outlined in amendments Nos. 12 to 15, inclusive, or failing to take into account Deputy Howlin's amendments, which are of a more limited nature.  The modus operandi, however, can be settled provided there is agreement do so.  That is the purpose of a debate of this kind.

Some aspects of the report, for instance, regarding inferences arising from the failure to mention facts, are too weak.  Another aspect of the report does not go far enough.

I did not undertake in public nor did I imply that I would immediately enact the report into law, even if I agreed with some of its provisions.  I will not go down that road.Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Howlin cannot have it both ways.  They cannot run with the Law Society on the one hand and say all these provisions are very major and require a good deal of thought——

I did not refer to taking the 295 pages of the Hogan report and immediately enacting them into law.  My amendments contain a proposal, the background of which goes back to 1982.  It has been examined from time and time and it was raised and supported, not least by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, in the context of the 2004 Bill.  It is not a new proposal.

If I were asked, I would choose Deputy Howlin's approach rather than Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's but I do not preclude that the Attorney General may fail to see merit in the latter's approach.  I need time and a Government decision but I have neither.  This legislation, when debated on Second Stage, did not incorporate any of this material.  If I am accused of legislating on the hoof, let it be clearly understood that I am being invited to do so by others.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	365	That is profoundly unfair in two ways and I would like to set the record straight.  Nobody asked that the Hogan report be implemented in full or that the legislative attachment be enacted as an appendix to this Bill.  The Minister has a propensity constantly to set up straw men so that he can pull them down.  I am reiterating the case I made a year ago and, therefore, there is nothing new in my approach.  As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe correctly stated, my approach was not novel even a year ago.  It has antecedents going back to the mid-1980s.  My difficulty with the Minister's approach is it is exactly what he said a year ago.  He supported the idea and he would have liked to accept the amendment but he needed to have a debate or talk to the Attorney General.  What has he done for a year, if he has not discussed this with the Attorney General?  If it is an important issue, why was that not part of the heads of the Bill he circulated in February and the substantive legislation before House?
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The Minister's principle is ludicrous.  He agrees with me in principle, yet he will not accept the proposal or offer any way to deal with it because there is not time to discuss it with the Attorney General.  This all goes back to the headlong rush the Minister is in to put the Bill on the Statute Book.  Are we trying to improve the criminal justice system?  The Minister stands convicted on the basis of his own words.  It is clear that is not his central purpose and, on that basis, I press my amendment.

In page 6, before section 5, but in Part 1, to insert the following new section:"PART 2WITNESS INTIMIDATION5.—The Minister shall, by regulation under this section, make provision for identification of suspects by witnesses, victims and other persons where the suspect can be identified through a one-way screen and the identity of the witness, victim or other person can be withheld.".A month ago I was approached on behalf of somebody who had been raped.  The question of an identification parade arose and I was asked what was the process and the procedure involved.  The person concerned did not want to face the trauma of seeing her assailant face to face under any circumstances.  I tabled a question to the Minister on 20 March on whether a process involving two-way mirrors was available for identity parades in order that a rape victim or a victim of a serious assault would not have his or her identity disclosed.  The response was that according to the Garda authorities, formal identification parades were the main way of identifying a suspect by a victim or witness prior to a court case.  Instructions issued to every member of the Garda Síochána set out how a parade should be conducted, based on established best practice and case law precedent.  In the response the Minister continued to state that the process did not involve the use of a two-way mirror.This confirmed to me that the trauma faced by the person concerned was absolutely genuine and I was horrified.  I examined the situation and found that in the United Kingdom and other countries it had been changed.  The Minister indicated he was reviewing the matter to see what improvements, if any, might be made, including the possibility of making the procedure less traumatic for victims and witnesses.I was quite affected by the situation and the thought that the assailant might get away because the victim was horrified at the notion of having to face him in an identification parade but I was heartened to find that the issue was dealt with in the report of the balance in the criminal law review group.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	386	On what page of the report?
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	387	On page 233.  The report states two issues were raised.  One was the possible inference that might be drawn from a failure to attend an identity parade.  I will not focus on this because it raises broader issues and the group did not come out with a clear recommendation.  The second issue raised was that the injured party would identify the person involved from behind a one-way screen.  It is a brief recommendation and appears to have also been considered by the Leahy committee but nothing followed from the Leahy report.  The review group clearly favours the concept of allowing, as far as practicable, the injured party to identify the suspect through a one-way screen.  The report also states it is not clear that a change in the law is required to achieve this result.In presenting the amendment I reckoned it was a process and procedure which should be put in place as quickly as possible.  I tabled the amendment on the basis of it being an enabling provision.  It would not specifically provide for the use of one-way screens but enable the Minister to make provision by regulating for "the identification of suspects by witnesses, victims and other persons where the suspect can be identified through a one-way screen and the identity of the witness, victim or other person can be withheld".  I want to give the Minister power to enable him to change the law, if necessary.  The amendment would provide a mechanism to empower the Minister to make regulations to introduce this change which is necessary.  When we discuss grand principles of law, we must also get down to the practicalities.  In some instances the practicalities are more important that the grand principles.  If, as a matter of practicality, an unfortunate woman who was raped is not able to face an identification parade where she must physically confront her assailant and identify him, we should do what is necessary to avoid this and change the procedure.I accept the old process was changed some years ago.  Previously, a victim had to place his or her hand on the shoulder of the identified person.  This is no longer part of the process.  Let us go farther and at least avoid this trauma for victims such as those I described.

I want to think about the exact way in which it should be brought into law.  I recall a case where because of intimidation an individual was allowed watch from a van on a street where it was understood the person would be and identify the person to gardaí.  The evidence was acceptable in court.

I accept the point about sexual crime victims being re-traumatised by a very scary process in which they must physically confront their assailants.  I take the wider point on gangland activity where people may find the process of identification frightening.  It would be frightening if one saw somebody shoot down someone in front of one and was then asked to pick out that person in a face to face confrontation.  I am with the Deputy 100% and propose to examine the amendment.I agree with the Leahy report that it is probably unnecessary to change the law to do this but it certainly is necessary to have an adequate way to do it.  In some North American cities and places in the United Kingdom quite elaborate rooms are set aside where this can happen.  As one can imagine, it would cost a lot of money to dedicate a room to this purpose regionally.  I want to examine the practicalities of what is suggested.  It should be possible to use a mobile booth which could be brought to a place where a crime was committed.  Not only victims of sexual crime but others are afraid of the physical confrontation method used.  I accept the principle of the Deputy's proposal but I do not want to commit myself to the exact wording proposed by the Deputy.The old traditional thinking must have been based to some extent on how evidence of identification by somebody not in the room with the accused would be given without breaching the hearsay rule.  I do not know whether it is relevant to the hearsay rule if an accused person is told by somebody else that a person outside the room identified him or her.  Whether it is relevant or had anything to do with the old-fashioned way of confronting the accused and letting him or her know he or she had been selected, we should modernise the system in practice, whatever about the theory of it.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	391	On the basis my amendment is accepted in principle, it is a matter of how we might implement it in practice.  I want to ensure one way or another, whether through law, regulation or a change in practice, that at the earliest possible opportunity a process will be put in place whereby rape victims and others will not have to face their assailants directly in an identification parade if they feel unable to do so.  I recommend the Tánaiste consider the case in the UK, where they have clearly got around the practical problems.  I am sure the same applies in other relatively small countries, although I am unsure of the situation in New Zealand and elsewhere.  I appreciate there may be practical difficulties but whatever we do, we should not add to the trauma of rape victims and others by making them confront an assailant in identification parades.This explains the purpose of the amendment.  I hope the Tánaiste accepts the spirit of it and will give absolute confirmation that he will put in train the necessary change to ensure identification parades are conducted with a one-way screen.  I hope this will be done before he goes out of office, which would only give him a matter of weeks.  Conducting such parades with a one-way screen would allow the identity of the victim to be withheld.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I move amendment No. 17:
In page 6, before section 5, but in Part 1, to insert the following new section:"PART 2EXCLUSIONARY RULE5.—(1) Where evidence is obtained in contravention of a person's constitutional rights, whether numerated or unenumerated, such evidence may, having regard to the totality of the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the rights of the victim, be deemed by the court to be nonetheless admissible, unless—(a) the evidence was not obtained in good faith, and(b) the contravention of the person’s constitutional rights was—(i) intentional, and(ii) significant in the context of the offence alleged.".The last issue was a matter of practicality but with this amendment I am getting into an area of serious law, which I accept.  Many issues annoy me in the criminal justice system, and seeing people accused of serious crimes walking out the door on the basis of technicalities is one of them.  That brings the criminal justice system into disrepute.  I know smart lawyers are paid big fees to find technical problems etc. and it is their job so I do not blame them.  I wish the Tánaiste every success if he returns to that practice.The general public loses confidence and faith in a system where this happens.  This is where evidence is clearly available but there may be a basis for some technicality, such as a minor defect in a search warrant.  I will not recall any particular case but I am sure all of us can remember cases of that nature.  An accused can walk out the door on the basis of this technicality, even where there is considerable evidence against him or her.I have been considering how one might change the law in this regard.  I asked the Houses of the Oireachtas research service to examine the issue and I compliment those involved in that service.  They are at long last providing an excellent function to members of the Opposition in particular, who do not have access to any similar support.  I received an excellent paper on the issue towards the end of last year from Dr. Emma Fee of that particular service, and I compliment her and her colleagues on the service provided.It shows that if we proceed carefully and cautiously, changes can be made which will not unduly entrench on the traditional historical rights of the accused to a fair trial.  I was heartened by the consideration of this issue by the review group.On page 147 of its report, the background of the exclusionary rule was traced and it appears it is of relatively recent origin.  It has developed to an extent where, effectively, on any technicality prosecutions can fail.  The most extreme example was in the Dylan Creavan v. Criminal Assets Bureau case.  In that instance, as a result of the judge not being in his assigned area when the search warrant was signed, everything recovered in the course of the subsequent search was deemed to be improperly obtained.  That makes the law an ass.That provision was changed not by tackling the broader issue of the exclusionary rule but by a change introduced in the Criminal Justice Act we passed last year not requiring the judge to be physically present in his or her own district when a search warrant is signed.  That closed that part of the loophole.  The broader issue of what happens when the accused walks out the door on the basis of a technicality was not dealt with, but it has been dealt with in great detail by the Hogan committee.  An opinion on it clearly emerges from the majority of the committee, although this majority excludes Dr. Hogan.  It is one of the instances where I disagree with him.  On page 161 the report states: "A majority of the Group is of the view that the current exclusionary rule is too strictly calibrated, and would wish to see a situation develop where the court would have a discretion to admit the evidence or not, having regard to the totality of the circumstances and in particular the rights of the victim."In our approach to the whole criminal justice system in general and in particular in dealing with a Bill of this kind, we must be more cognisant of the rights of the victim.The review group went on to look at the different possibilities, one of which is having the issue revisited by the Supreme Court.  That would be to avoid our responsibilities, as the Oireachtas makes the law.  We cannot wait around for the Supreme Court to be given a nod to reconsider the issue, and it would depend on an appropriate case coming before it anyway.The group and the research paper looked at the scenario in other countries and arising from that I have tabled these amendments as to what should be admissible.  The majority recommendation from the review group states:We would wish to see a situation where the court would have a discretion to admit unconstitutionally obtained evidence or not, having regard to the totality of the circumstances and in particular the rights of the victim.  In the first instance we suggest the approach of seeing whether a change in jurisprudence emerges following use of the appeal provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  If not, the other options would then have to be examined and considered.  As stated above, these other options include various legislative models or possibly constitutional change.This is a menu.  We should not wait around for the Supreme Court and we should avoid a constitutional change if at all possible.  We should try to find a way forward within the parameters of legislation.For that reason I tabled this amendment, which essentially provides: "Where evidence is obtained in contravention of a person's constitutional rights, whether numerated or unenumerated, such evidence may, having regard to the totality of the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the rights of the victim, be deemed by the court to be nonetheless admissible, unless [here we get into the safeguards and exceptions] the evidence was not obtained in good faith [that would be essential] and the contravention of the person's constitutional rights was intentional and significant in the context of the offence alleged."  It is not a question of trampling on the accused's constitutional rights.  Rather, it is a question of taking into account the circumstances in which he or she could claim a breach of those rights because of a technicality.During my investigation of the issue, another situation emerged, namely, members of the Garda Síochána becoming aware of evidence, material or facts that could be used as evidence in a case or indicate to him or her that a crime has been or is likely to be committed.  The garda would not have time to seek a search warrant.  For example, he or she could be passing a door behind which he or she suspected criminal activity was under way.I refer to this as the "plain sight" amendment.  I do not claim to be reinventing the wheel, as this proposal stems from the law of other countries, but it is time to take it on board.  It sounds ludicrous that a garda who sees or, on reasonable grounds, suspects criminal activity taking place must find a District Court judge to sign a search warrant to inspect and collect evidence.  In 99 cases out of 100, the evidence is gone by the time the garda returns with the warrant.  This is the basis for my proposal.  How many amendments are we taking with amendment No. 17?

My constituents and I would agree with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's proposals, which are necessary in principle.  Many victims of crime see the perpetrators go free from court on technicalities.

If legislation allows the Constitution to be thrown to the wind to a certain extent, difficulties would arise.  The question of whether a referendum on the legislation is required is in doubt, but I agree with the sentiments and principles expressed in the amendments.  I await the Tánaiste's response.

Approximately two years ago, the Taoiseach wrote to the Attorney General and me asking us to examine the issue.  We have considered it and I will explain why it is a difficult matter.If Dr. Hogan's dissentient opinion, which is derived from a Supreme Court opinion on the Constitution, is correct, it is not open to the Oireachtas to reverse his opinion by legislation.  However, even that is not certain, as Dr. Hogan and the report in general concede.  What is certain is that if I include the provision in the Bill, which would amount to a purported reversal of the Kenny case decided on by the Supreme Court, the likelihood of the Bill being referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 would be enormous.  If it turned out that Dr. Hogan was right and the majority was wrong, the Bill would fall.If there is merit in taking a legislative approach, it should be a one-section Bill at another time, but I do not want to have this Bill fall or stand by reason of coming down on one side or another of a well reasoned argument set out in writing before us.

With respect, the majority was wrong.  This is my personal viewpoint.  It seems that the best course of action would be to re-argue the case before the Supreme Court on some proper set of facts or to hold a constitutional referendum on the matter.  People do not like holding such referenda if they have not exhausted possibilities.It is to be noted that prior to the 1996 bail referendum, an effort was made to revisit the O'Callaghan case on the granting of bail in the Supreme Court to determine whether the court was adhering to the old opinion on the matter.

The evidence obtained would be excluded in circumstances where the defendant had no merits of any kind whatsoever, but he or she would walk free, which is offensive to most people.  The minority, or discretionary, view in the Kenny case was that a balance had to be struck between rights rather than a rigid view being taken.  I would prefer if that view were reflected in the law — that is my personal preference.  I am not sure how we can get there, however.  If I were to come to the House some afternoon with a one-section Bill, and explain that I wanted to experiment in such a manner, Deputies would probably ask me what the Attorney General had to say about my plan.

Some people might suggest I should instruct the Director of Public Prosecutions to revisit this matter in a suitable case before the Supreme Court.  If I were to go down the constitutional route, it would be quite difficult for me to include in the Constitution an exact or bang-on formula that would not have unintended consequences.  While I am grateful to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe for raising this issue — I am not being negative — I am not sure it is appropriate to make this multi-section Bill, which has various purposes, a test bench for a constitutional proposition.  I accept that personal beliefs might apply quite strongly in this regard, but I do not think we should put the whole Bill in peril of being knocked on the head by getting it wrong on this single issue.  While my instinct is to encourage the Director of Public Prosecutions to revisit this matter, possibly via the Attorney General in a suitable case, I am concerned that suitable cases are not encountered very often.

It is quite difficult, given the various circumstances which apply, to find a suitable case that is in a format in which one can bring it to the Supreme Court for an authoritative decision.  I am not sure that my argument convinces anybody.  The one thing I am absolutely sure of is that I will not accept this amendment — to do so would, in effect, be like carrying a bomb onto an aeroplane without knowing when it is due to go off.  I cannot do that in these circumstances.

However, I am not having much success in securing the changes in the law which I feel are necessary.  We need to go back to first principles when considering these issues.  The first point is that we constitute the Legislature.  I respect the independence of the courts, but my first job is to legislate.  I would like to set out the background to this discussion.  We are really talking about whether evidence against an accused person to which technical objections can be raised should be excluded in all circumstances, thereby leading to the acquittal of that person on technical grounds.  It is no harm to recollect what happened in the Kenny case, which is the leading case in this regard.  The accused person was charged with the possession of drugs which were found on foot of a search of his home.  Given that when they searched his home they found the drugs, of which he was in possession, one would imagine it to be an open and shut case.  The accused person had some shrewd lawyers who argued the warrant was bad because insufficient information was placed before the peace commissioner who issued it, as was then the practice, to enable him to be satisfied there were reasonable grounds for granting it.  How in the name of goodness does that affect the issue of whether the man was in possession of drugs?

Three of the six judges held that everything was okay and the trial judge decided the warrant was valid.  When the matter was passed to the Supreme Court, the majority of its members — I respect them and acknowledge they are entitled to have a view — stated that a conscious and deliberate violation of the constitutional rights of the accused person had taken place.  How in the name of goodness could that stand up?  It does not make sense.

We have to get back to first principles.  It is easy to suggest that constitutional rights are being trampled on.  I do not believe that is the case in this instance.  I am proposing that questions of this nature should be examined in the round, that any conscious violation of rights should be prohibited and that things should be done in a bona fide manner.  Such an approach has been successful in courts in other jurisdictions.  We are not unique in this regard.  I note in the research report I have that it was held in Australia that trial judges have discretion which is related to a number of factors, including the seriousness of the offence, the cogency of the evidence, the nature of the criminality, the ease with which the evidence would have been obtained legally and the extent to which an examination of the legislation indicates a deliberate intent on the part of the Legislature to circumscribe the power of the police in the interests of the public.  If there is a deliberate intent to ensure as far as possible that those who are brought before the criminal courts are given a fair trial, then they should be acquitted if they are found fairly not to be guilty.  However, they should not be allowed to walk out the door on the basis of mere technicalities which are peripheral to the essential and fundamental nature of the case.It seems that my efforts to bring about a change in this regard will not be successful, despite the reinforcement of my view from the Government benches when the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights openly expressed his support for such a change.  I appreciate that we face time constraints.  I am open to advice.  I want progress to be made on this issue.  I acknowledge the Minister will not accept my amendments today, so I will not pursue them further.  I want a way forward to be established, although we may have to wait until after the forthcoming general election for that.  Given that Deputies from the main parties on all sides of the House, including the principal Government party, are supportive of change, we should be finding a way forward.  It is obvious that I do not speak for all the parties in the House in that regard.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I would like to comment briefly on this important set of amendments without prolonging the debate.  A coherent case has been made.  The Minister has given a reasonable response on his ability to carry this bomb on board the aircraft.  There is disbelief among the general public that we cannot structure the legal system in a way that ensures glaring wrongs can be avoided.  People who self-evidently should be held accountable are not being held accountable because of problems with the hour of the day or the geographical location, or because some dot or comma is not right.  I appreciate that the learned judges in this country's higher courts do an extraordinarily important job in protecting the constitutional rights of every citizen.  It seems that their work sometimes involves a point of intellectual debate rather than a point of justice, however.  I do not think people in general understand that the law takes priority over justice.  As most of us are not trained lawyers, which is a good thing, we struggle to craft decent law — to steer the juggernaut — in a way that makes eminent sense, is supported by the bulk of the people and, above all, is just and provides justice.We will not do so today and I do not wish to prolong the debate, but there are compelling issues that must be addressed.  It is not acceptable to wait for another vehicle such as a case stated before the Supreme Court.  We must find a better way of doing it.  It might be an effective job of work for an incoming justice committee to examine this with officials from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and external legal opinion such as the Hogan group.

Waiting for a suitable opportunity involves hoping the DPP finds such an opportunity, but he is independent and must make decisions independently.  The Legislature might be better employed in considering a single clause Bill upon which other matters did not ride, as suggested by Deputy Howlin.  I placed this on the agenda to be considered by the Hogan committee and I am also concerned by it.I remember a case where a car was searched.  My former colleague, the late Eamon Leahy, SC, was defending and suggested the evidence should be excluded on the basis that there were no reasonable grounds for believing drugs were in the car.  The judge, not one who ruled in the majority in the Kenny case, suggested that the fact that drugs were found under the seat of the car disposed of the argument.

In page 6, lines 33 and 34, to delete all words from and including "one" in line 33 down to and including "person" in line 34 and substitute "an employee of the Probation Service authorised".This seeks to ensure that if electronic tagging is agreed to, those authorised are members of the probation and welfare service rather than privatise another part of the justice system.  I am opposed to this privatisation on the same basis as the privatisation of the prisoner escort system.  I do not want gardaí sitting at a desk watching monitors, but the probation and welfare service could be resourced to undertake this function.  The service has the ability and understanding of the mindset and circumstances of people on bail or those who have been convicted and tagged.  If it is outsourced to a private company one cannot guarantee that interest or expertise.

These officers are skilled people who deal with offenders.  Looking at a screen and waiting for a button to flash has nothing to do with their qualifications and experience.  I am not trying to be overly ideological, but Deputy Ó Snodaigh's hard left ideology is bringing him into error.  It we introduce electronic tagging it would be madness to rule that only full-time public servants could monitor it.  That would make it unworkable and would represent an ineffective use of public servants' time.  I do not presume to speak for probation officers but they would be alarmed if I were to say on their behalf that they would be content to sit in a room waiting for alarms to sound.

The person does not have to be a probation officer but an employee of the probation and welfare service.  Another grade could be set up specifically to undertake this task but it would be staffed by public servants and they would be answerable to the probation and welfare service.  They could also gain from the experience shared by probation officers with whom they would work in conjunction.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I move amendment No. 22:
In page 7, to delete lines 18 to 22 and substitute the following:"(e) any previous convictions of the applicant and information as to which (if any) of those previous convictions were in respect of offences committed while the applicant was on bail;”.Section 6 inserts a new subsection 1A into the bail Act.  This new subsection sets out: "A person who is charged with a serious offence and applies for bail... shall... furnish to the prosecutor a written statement duly signed by the applicant and containing the following information relating to the applicant."  It then sets out in paragraphs (a) to (g) what is required.  I am suggesting that as regards the statement required, paragraphs (e) and (f) are deficient and I am proposing an alternative paragraph (e).  The (e) I suggest, in amendment No. 22, refers to “any previous convictions of the applicant and information as to which (if any) of those previous convictions were in respect of offences committed while the applicant was on bail”.At first glance the Tánaiste might say these concerns as regards (e) and (f) are captured by his amendments.  However, I believe the Tánaiste’s paragraph (e) is too narrow in that it is limited only to serious offences.  His paragraph (f) is too broad because the applicant has to set out “any offences or offence committed by the applicant while previously on bail”, not convictions but any offence he or she committed.  It is like being asked to write a confession.  We have already had a debate about self incrimination, so I do not believe the Tánaiste can ask people, in effect, to write a confession as regards any offences they have committed before they can apply for bail, regardless of whether they have been charged or convicted.  I do not believe this is right.The formulation I suggest deals with previous convictions which do not necessarily have to be serious and requires convictions to be set out that occurred while the person was on bail and is a preferable listing for the applicant to make before a bail hearing.

In page  7, to delete lines 23 to 26.This amendment involves the deletion of paragraph (g).  This is a major change because a judge should make his or her own decision on the basis of the application before the Bench and not on the basis of previous decisions taken by judges as regards applications relating to totally different charges.  That is one of the concerns I have as regards this whole section.  While there might be some logic to it, it is not as well thought out as it should be.  Further discussion might have corrected some of the problems I have in this regard.This section as a whole mentions that the person has to furnish the prosecutor with a written statement, but does not mention a timeframe, while later on it states that a court may extend the period for the production of same.  Perhaps the Tánaiste might explain whether this statement has to be given within a week, a day, or a few hours after the application for bail has been made.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	447	Briefly as regards (g), it would not oblige a court to follow other previous judgments made in respect of a person.  However, if a person has been refused bail on eight occasions, why should this not be brought to the attention of the ninth judge?  It would be strange if a judge were not to hear that type of material evidence. As regards subsection 5(a), extending the period for production of the statement by the applicant, the Deputy is correct that the section does not, in fact, specify a period.  I will consider this between now and Report Stage, but I believe what is meant is that it must be done at the time the person is making his or her application.  If a person comes to court without it, he or she can be asked to give the statement then, during the day or whatever, which amounts to an extension as regards the further information required.  I will examine this to see if there is a point there.

In page 8, line 15, to delete "may" and substitute "shall".If a court believes publication would prejudice a trial, then I believe it should definitely prevent this.

Amendment No. 29 would have the same effect, to make matters more definite rather than leave them open ended.

I will look at it again, but I am happier with "may" there, because it might be implied that if a mandatory provision was inserted, newspapers would be free to do anything they like unless such an order was made as regards a manner that would prejudice a trial.

Perhaps now is the time to try to find holes in it, however.  What if the person charged is illiterate, if that is the politically correct term, and unable to produce a written statement?  It must also be signed by the applicant.  I have occasionally come across cases where an individual has signed with a mark because he or she cannot sign his or her name.I agree with the intent of the section.  However, in the case of an individual with many convictions, he or she may not have the information to hand and cannot properly fill out the bail application.  I have often seen cases where there is a reference to, say, 39 previous convictions.  From a practical viewpoint, an applicant could be honestly unable to complete a bail statement because it would be impossible to remember, say, all 39 previous convictions.Subsection (7) states, "any witness may, with the leave of the court, be examined on the content of the statement".  Should this be "applicant" as the section refers to bail applications?  The preceding subsection states, "the statement shall be received in evidence ... if it purports to be signed by the applicant".The section also refers to improper publication where the court may by order direct that no information be broadcast or published.  What will be the consequences of breaches of such an order?  Is an offence for this created later in the legislation?

I do not want a situation where an individual with 85 previous convictions must give chapter and verse for each of them from memory when filling out a bail application.  On the other hand, having three convictions for murder should stick in one's mind.Regarding subsection (7), there will be an insertion in the 1997 Bail Act, of which section 4(4) provides that if any matter is published in contravention of the provisions of subsection (3), a number of people commit an offence, both summary and on indictment.  Section 6(15) of this Bill includes a cross-reference to the Bail Act.There may be occasions on which witnesses, other than the applicant, are giving evidence in support of the bail application.  If, for instance, an individual was to provide the applicant with accommodation, he or she could be examined on what was in the statement, with the leave of a court.

In page 9, to delete lines 4 to 10 and substitute the following:"(1) The opinion of a member of An Garda Síochána shall not be considered evidence of any fact or likelihood other than of his or her own opinion in proceedings under section 2.".A member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent, can give evidence that he or she considers there are reasonable grounds for refusing bail.  A similar provision is already contained in the Offences against the State Act.  I have always expressed concern about this provision.  If a member of the Garda Síochána has evidence against a person of a serious offence, that person should be charged.  It is not good enough that it can be based on an opinion rather than fact-based.  I strongly hold the belief, as I have argued in regard to the Offences Against the State Act, that much more than a person's opinion is required if the taking of a person's liberty is under consideration, which is what we are talking about in this instance.  We are talking about a bail application.  Such an approach is treading on dangerous ground.  I understand where people are coming from but there is an onus the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions who is taking the case to present evidence.  Judges do not like to refuse bail because of the length of time it takes for a court case to be heard.  That is often the reason bail is granted, even when a judge is not sure he or she should do so.  One way to address that is for cases to be heard quicker in the courts.  In fairness to the Minister he has allowed for extra judges to be appointed to reduce that delay.  Perhaps that will somewhat address this issue.  We are treading on dangerous ground when we allow a person's opinion to be treated as evidence in itself.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I tabled a one word amendment to section 7 but my concerns go much deeper.  Section 7 creates a new section 2A in the Bail Act 1997.  I made a reasonably long submission in my Second Stage contribution about the real fears that were alerted to me by my legal advisers at the time that section 7 is unconstitutional.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not respond in any way to that point at the conclusion of that debate.  Since he has rejected already an amendment from Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on the basis that it potentially would be a time bomb because he could not guarantee its constitutionality, I alert him to the real fear presented to me that the new section 2A is unconstitutional.I checked it subsequently beyond the legal advisers available to me in my work here.  I have the learned advice of a very distinguished senior counsel on this point, which I will share with the House if I may.  I have also been told that a learned professor of law who read this opinion also agrees with this view.The view on this point states:There must be a serious question about the constitutionality of the proposed Section 2A by way of addition/amendment to the Bail Act, 1997.  It is proposed that where a Garda not below the rank of Chief Superintendent gives evidence of a belief that the refusal of the application for bail is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the Applicant, such statement “is evidence that refusal of the application is reasonably considered necessary for that purpose”. ...If the section is enacted as it stands it will carry the presumption of constitutionality which simply means that when it comes to a consideration of its constitutionality [in the courts] the courts must proceed on the basis that where two possible constructions, one constitutional and [one] ... unconstitutional, are available, the Court must adopt that interpretation which conforms with the Constitution.The difficulty with the section as it stands is that it seems to seek to place the Bail Court in a position of being statutorily obliged to accept the evidence of opinion that is put [to]...it.  Thus, whereas section 2(1) permits the Court to refuse an application where it is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence the requirement that the Court should be so satisfied is fulfilled where “the statement is evidence that refusal of the application is reasonably considered necessary for that purpose” as provided for the proposed Section 2A(1).On...[the] face [of it] the new provision seems to require the Court to refuse an application where it has evidence of the prescribed opinion although a...[reasonable] connection between that opinion and the refusal of bail to the applicant has not actually been established to the satisfaction of the Court.Whereas one might view the entirety of section 2 and the new section 2A on the basis that section 2(1) is the controlling section which requires the Court in all instances to be “satisfied” it seems to be quite clear that the proposed section 2A is intended in some way to derogate from section 2(1).  It becomes a question of the extent of the derogation and it seems clear that section 2A(1) has been drafted in a way so as to make it clear that the Bail Court must act on the unrebutted evidence of [the] opinion of a Garda of the rank of Chief Superintendent [or above] by refusing the bail application.It seems reasonably clear from the language adopted that this is the intention of the draughtsman in this case.  Thus, the presumption of constitutionality is of little aid.  So, for instance, in a case where there is...no evidence except that of the Chief Superintendent it is difficult to see how the Bail Judge could be satisfied that refusal of the application was not reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence.  Indeed it would appear that no matter how well the opinion of the Chief Superintendent was undermined by cross-examination the fact that he gave the opinion on oath would render it evidence upon which the Bail Judge must act.Article 34 provides for the administration of justice in the Courts established by the Constitution.  However, this proposed amendment to the 1997 Bail Act appears to be open to the principled objection that it would have the effect that Bail Judges would be placed in a position of having to suspend their judgment on the issue of the satisfactoriness of the evidence grounding [the]...objection to bail where the Garda authorities [above the rank of Chief Superintendent] considered the refusal of the application is “reasonably considered necessary” to prevent the commission of a serious offence.In essence, I have tomes of opinion but this is the clearest exposition of it that I wanted to present.  It is the opinion of people whose opinion is respected across the House.  I will not give the names of the individuals unless I am asked to do so because that would be disingenuous.  I cite the fear that there is a substantial difference between this and the provisions that have been applied in the Offences Against the State Act.  This is not evidence that is rebuttable and on which the court can make an independent decision.  While they certainly can cross-examine the witness, as stated, the mere assertion itself is the evidence.Section 2A(1) in section 7 is inelegantly drafted and that is the reason I drafted my amendment, but that is a separate issue from my concern about its constitutionality.  I propose the deletion of the word "considered" in the last line of it.  The section states, "...the statement is evidence that refusal of the application is reasonably considered necessary for that purpose", but surely it should state "the statement is evidence that refusal of the application is reasonably necessary for that purpose".  What is being judged in this instance is whether it is reasonably considered necessary.  It is the consideration that is being judged as opposed to the necessity.  It seems perhaps to be meaningless, as currently drafted.  If the Minister wants to proceed as he intends to, at least the Garda evidence should be relevant to the issue that is before the court.There are two separate issues, which perhaps I may not have outlined elegantly.  The first is the genuine fear that the provision, as drafted, may be unconstitutional and may well put the entirety of the Minister's proposals in jeopardy for that reason.  The second is that the provision is inelegantly drafted and would be made clearer, if the Minister wants to persevere with it, by the acceptance of this amendment.

I was always happy to have that opinion accepted and taken into account by the court because it was an opinion as to fact.  I can see what the Minister is trying to get at here but he is going about it the wrong way.  How can an opinion that somebody will commit a crime in the future be taken as a fact in any circumstance?

I recommend the Tánaiste goes back to the drawing board.  I see his point and I support the idea but to suggest that a chief superintendent having a general view that an applicant for bail would commit any offence in the future and regarding this as evidence of the fact, is turning the English language on its head.  Is there not a case for saying that if the chief superintendent expresses an opinion on the basis of the past record of the applicant that he is likely to commit further offences, that this opinion will be taken into account?  Is this what we are trying to get at?  Trying to suggest that this opinion is hard evidence does not stand up in logic.  There is a danger that if we put together law that does not stand up in logic, some bright lawyer will find loopholes in it and have it overturned on constitutional grounds or otherwise.  I am merely suggesting a reformulation to achieve the effect which the Tánaiste undoubtedly wishes to achieve and which I support.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I also have some concerns about the subsection, particularly in light of the Supreme Court ruling in the Shortt case last week where the evidence of the gardaí on the facts was questioned as to whether it was the truth and the whole truth.  The fact that a chief superintendent is designated in the subsection implies that a lesser mortal, such as a superintendent, an inspector or a sergeant, may not be up to the case.  I question the reasoning for this designation.  The subsection states that the chief superintendent, "believes that refusal of the application is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person".  Does this mean that a chief superintendent, an inspector or a sergeant actually considers it necessary and that the chief superintendent states in court that it is considered necessary without having to say at which rank this decision was made?  It might be necessary to bolster this with the chief superintendent having to perform a comprehensive review of the file in front of him before he states that he personally considers it reasonably necessary, having reviewed the file, that an offence may be committed by this person.The Garda Síochána has a lot of work to do as a result of the Donegal situation; it cannot be given carte blanche regarding evidence given in court about serious charges.  The force must earn again the full respect of the community and we should be careful not to give it carte blanche as stated in the Bill.  I acknowledge that the majority of gardaí would take their responsibilities seriously and tell the whole and unvarnished truth.  However, we must ensure that the ethos within the Garda Síochána is such that this would be the case for 100% of gardaí.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I have listened to Deputy Howlin expound this view and I was interested to hear him elaborate on it now.  Two issues arise, the first being the issue as to whether the word "considered" should appear in the last line of the subsection.  I will examine this carefully.  That something is evidence of something does not ascribe weight to it of any particular kind and does not oblige somebody to accept it even in the absence of contradictory evidence but it does make it admissible in the proceedings.I ask the House to bear in mind that I am moving amendment No. 31.  At the moment opinion evidence is admissible in bail applications and I did not wish it to be said the only evidence admissible from now on would be that of a chief superintendent because many of these cases are dealt with in the District Court and we cannot have chief superintendents ferrying around the country to shore up cases in that way.  The real issue is whether on the grounds of reasonable necessity we are prepared to make the evidence of a chief superintendent — who by definition is subject to cross-examination if somebody does not agree with his opinion — corroborative of the proposition that the Garda Síochána is arguing.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	484	The statement is evidence.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	485	It is evidence but it does not prescribe the weight to be attached to that evidence and if it is cross-examined it could dribble away to nothing.  If it appeared in the circumstances that it was a gratuitous or arbitrary opinion, then that evidence may mean nothing but at least it is admissible in the matter.I will look at Deputy Howlin's proposed amendment which is the taking out of the word "considered" because it may well be that this is a matter for the court rather than a matter for the superintendent.  If we proceed on the basis that a chief superintendent may give evidence that he is of the opinion that a withholding of bail is reasonably necessary and that the court may receive that as evidence in the matter, it is something that the court can put into the balance against the evidence given by the applicant.  It is the case at present that opinion evidence is admissible and the amendment No. 31 in my name is designed to make it clear that this will not wipe out all other opinion evidence being received in a case of this kind.   The amendment is designed to ensure that a chief superintendent's evidence shall be admissible on the grounds outlined.A chief superintendent may not have arrested a person but he is empowered to carry out a search to discover who are the individual's antecedents, his or her connections to others involved in organised crime etc.  He can give his opinion and, in such circumstances, counsel or the solicitor acting for the applicant can inquire as to the basis on which he arrived at that opinion.  If a chief superintendent refuses to provide any basis, the court will inquire as to what import it is to attach to his opinion.It is noticeable, in the jurisprudence of the Special Criminal Court in respect of opinion evidence, that if a chief superintendent merely provides evidence of opinion of membership, does not elaborate on it and is contradicted on oath, as far as I know, convictions never follow.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	486	That is the point I made on Second Stage.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The phrase "that it is evidence" does not mean that it is conclusive evidence which a court must follow or to which it must attach a degree of weight.  The phrase in question merely means that it is evidence along those lines.  If, at the end of the argument, the court is to inquire whether it has any evidence that the prosecution's case is correct, the answer will be that it has that provided by the chief superintendent.I agree that there is a difference, in principle, between opinion as to past fact and opinion as to possible future developments.  The courts must operate on that basis.  If an engineer states that a building will fall down unless remedial work is carried out, that is an opinion, based on certain considerations, regarding a future development.  Opinion evidence does not have to be confined to past facts.  Opinion as to past facts is probably less admissible than opinion relating to future hypotheses.I will reconsider the position regarding deleting the word "considered" because I accept Deputy Howlin's point in that regard.  However, I do not accept the proposition that this is somehow being made into coercive, conclusive or overwhelming evidence that the court's function in this under the Constitution will be abrogated by a chief superintendent coming before it and stating his belief that a case must be decided in his favour.  I do not believe the court would construe the meaning of the provision in this way.  Constitutional construction must be held and I am not contending that a chief superintendent may oblige a court to hold in his favour by simply tendering a statement to it.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I welcome the Tánaiste's thoughtful response and his commitment to reconsider the position.  I am putting forward two separate propositions.  The first of these is the actual constitutional basis of the provision.  This goes beyond the notion of being able to provide an opinion as to future events as opposed to an opinion as to past or current facts, which are a different matter.  However, that is not the point I am making.  I am asking the Tánaiste to deal with an issue that arises on foot of advice I received from a distinguished senior counsel who stated that, on the face of it, the new provision seems to require the court to refuse an application where it has evidence of the prescribed opinion although a reasoned connection between that opinion and the refusal of bail to the applicant has not actually been established to the satisfaction of the court.

If the Tánaiste provides categorical assurances that this was not his or the parliamentary counsel's intention or if he can indicate whether he would accept any other form of words that might make his intentions clearer, I would be more content.

Is he seriously stating that a chief superintendent would be able to make himself aware of the requisite knowledge relating to a person in that time?  That is a strange procedure.  As Deputy Howlin stated, gardaí are already in a position to make their opinions known but this is not regarded as evidence.  It is stated in the new section 2A(1) to be inserted into the 1997 Act that the "statement is evidence".  In addition, the new section 2A(2) states: "Evidence given by such a member in the proceedings is not admissible in any criminal proceedings."  If the evidence is not good enough to be admissible in criminal proceedings, it should not be acceptable in respect of a bail application because, at that stage, it would be no more than hearsay, rumour or supposition.  The judicial system is not based on hearsay, rumour or supposition, it is based on provable fact.  Opinion is not provable.In previous cases, chief superintendents argued that their opinions were based on confidential material.  Thankfully, the courts eventually ruled that this was not sufficient.  A recent change to this assertion on the part of chief superintendents was that their evidence was based on evidence contained in Garda files.  Defence counsel are not in a position to access such files and are not, therefore, in a position to rebut any presumptions a chief superintendent might make in offering his or her opinion.  As events in Donegal have shown, gardaí can be vindictive.  We need to ensure that nothing in the future allows such a person to block somebody from liberty.  If a court decides in time to convict somebody, that person will be convicted on evidence of provable facts.  Even in the case of bail applications, we should not allow for hearsay or rumour to prevent somebody from being at liberty.

As far as bail is concerned, it is my intention, save in the cases provided for in subsections (4) and (5), that there should generally be this statement of application for bail in the written form.  Obviously, in run-of-the-mill District Court cases such as burglary, the district judge may well state that he or she is dispensing with the need for a written statement in this ordinary case and as it is common case that the person concerned has two previous convictions, there is no point in having him or her write the history of his life, and his or her assets are of no interest to the court.The court has power to dispense completely with the written statement procedure if it thinks it is a waste of its time.  I presume that in most cases the prosecutor would not require the filling out of this written document because it would merely delay proceedings.  Where there is a contested case, what is necessary now is to put the applicant for bail into the circumstance of having to set out the facts of the matter and to back them up with evidence.  This is because often the garda must get into the witness box and take an oath to give evidence on the application, but the applicant simply sits there concealing all sorts of matters, for instance, including facts such as that he or she has committed previous offences while on bail.  In contested cases this will tie applicants to bail to some version of their own history, which is capable of being met by the prosecution.

Deputy Ardagh is correct, the entire judgment made horrifying reading.  Wise and learned opinion was quoted from a former US Supreme Court Associate Justice, Mr. Justice Thurgood Marshall, in giving the Supreme Court's decision in the Shortt case.  It gave a clear message to the Legislature, and I suppose to the Judiciary too, not to rely simply on verbal evidence from anybody, no matter how eminent, or to give the supposition that the word of one category of individual, a policeman or policewoman, is always correct and always superior to anybody else's evidence.  The Tánaiste is doing that in this Bill.  It runs counter to the spirit of the Shortt judgment and the clear warning we got from the Supreme Court on these matters.I recall that in the last Criminal Justice Bill there was a proposition to give additional powers to the gardaí in the case of search warrants which we removed on foot of the most recent batch of reports from the Morris tribunal because of that issue, that we had to be careful giving authority.  This is fundamental.  It relates to the liberty of individuals on the word of any individual.  We must deal with great care with that matter.I am obliged to Deputy Ardagh for reminding me.  I thought I had a copy of the Supreme Court judgment in my bundle of papers — it is on my desk upstairs — because I certainly wanted to refer to it.I understand that the Tánaiste is considering amendment No. 28 for Report Stage.

Are we speaking of share certificates or what?  As this deals with moneys being paid into a court as a surety or as a condition of recognisance and the possibility of other security being accepted in lieu of such payment, the question arises as to why an instrument of title to property will not be accepted.

I am opposed to this proposal for a number of reasons.  In the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, the Tánaiste said electronic tagging would have to prove more efficient and less expensive than traditional probation and welfare measures.  However, we have not seen any evidence to prove this.The only information I have been able to locate on electronic tagging is contained in a report by the British probation service which found that electronic tagging cost twice as much as supervision by members of the probation service.  The private security companies which administered the electronic tagging schemes did not routinely follow up violations by individual offenders and the British Government paid private tagging companies approximately three times the actual cost of each offender monitored.  The report concluded that electronic monitoring did not lead to a reduction in the level of reoffending.I cited that report last year and have not yet been contradicted.  It is a pity we do not have sufficient time to debate this issue.  When the Tánaiste heard our argument, he said he was initially in favour of electronic tagging but as more evidence emerged, he agreed to reconsider the issue because he said his enthusiasm for it was ebbing.  He stated:When the data began to emerge, I wondered where it was worth the candle, but rather than walk away completely from it, it is included in limited form in the legislation ... I have not yet generated plans for its immediate roll out, other than, perhaps, on a pilot basis.That statement concerned people who were convicted but we have not seen the pilot project, the new evidence which proves electronic tagging is the greatest thing since sliced bread or the additional investment needed in the probation and welfare service to ensure it has the capacity to monitor persons on bail or after release.  Deputy Howlin asked for evidence on whether electronic tagging worked and data on the numbers tagged in Britain, to which the Tánaiste replied:I know from listening to BBC Radio 4 that a fair number of crimes were committed by people who were under the supervision of the probation service in the UK.  I presume the same applies in this instance.He is correct that no system is infallible but we need to examine the matter in closer detail before we start to undermine the rights of people who are presumed innocent. In last year's instance, we addressed people convicted by the courts.  The provision needs further examination.  With regard to last year's proposition, the Irish Human Rights Commission, which has not had an opportunity to prepare its considered opinion of this legislation such is the haste with which it is being processed, stated electronic tagging should not be used as a replacement for the Probation and Welfare Service and should not result in resources being diverted away from this service, which is under resourced.  The commission favours alternatives to electronic tagging.Judges in other jurisdictions have issued tagging orders like Smarties because they can avoid the procedures such as those proposed by the Tánaiste regarding bail applications.  I am inclined not to agree this proposal because evidence has not been presented to us and because, since the Tánaiste stated electronic tagging will be monitored by the private sector, further elements of the criminal justice system will be privatised.

Given the rapidity with which he is progressing this legislation, there is deep seated concern and unease at his efforts to play to the gallery on the crime issue.  It is farcical on his part to rush this legislation while amending his own proposals on the hoof, particularly when the Hogan report has not been considered in detail.  By not waiting to consider the balance in the criminal law review group's report, this will institutionalise the concept of putting the cart before the horse.The Green Party has major concerns about the legislation and its provision for a seven-day detention period, amendments to the bail laws and the right to silence and electronic tagging.  We should move slower on these issues.  Discussing a seven-day detention when Mr. Justice Morris's tribunal has not concluded and, therefore, granting the Garda such significant authority when its authority has been called into question does not make sense.A pilot project on electronic tagging should be implemented before the section is enacted.  The provision is at odds with the Tánaiste's reply to a parliamentary question last year, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh highlighted.  The Tánaiste stated the section would only apply to serious offences but the evidence from abroad is tagging does not work for such offences.  He is not heading in the right direction on this issue and there is an absence of commitment to good, old fashioned policing methods.  I am deeply worried at the bulk of the provisions in the legislation and I, therefore, oppose the section.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I strongly urge support for electronic tagging.  I have examined documentation since our earlier discussion on this issue, which states electronic tagging works in other countries and it is cost effective.  An early release programme, which uses such tagging, is provided for in previous legislation.  If I had the option of being held in custody pending trial or being released on bail with a tag, I would prefer the latter.  That would not be a diminution of one's civil liberties.  On the contrary, electronic schemes have worked in other countries.  In the UK, 80% compliance has been achieved with the terms of the tagging while almost 90% has been achieved in Sweden.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	545	It has also been found in the UK that very few offenders who completed curfew orders breached other community penalties that ran alongside.  That is why I would like people to have an open mind regarding such new technology.  It would be an addition to the range of instruments available to deal with criminals and significant savings could be made.  For example, the cost of home detention curfews in the UK was approximately Stg£880 per month whereas it costs €2,000 per week to keep somebody in custody in Ireland.  In addition, we do not have sufficient prison accommodation, as evidenced by the more than 3,000 early release orders made last year, many of which clearly related to overcrowding.We should actively embrace this technology and put in place the procedures to make it operational as quickly as possible.  We should not be deterred because electronic tagging rather than GPS tracking is more readily available and is proven to work.  It should also be borne in mind that offenders also benefit significantly.  An offender, for example, could retain his or her employment and his or her relationship with his or her family.  Above all, electronic tagging is a cheaper alternative to custody and it works.  Perhaps my approach to the criminal justice system is very much rooted in practicality but surely such a practical solution should be embraced with open arms.

I would like the Tánaiste to comment on his change of mind since he received a letter on that matter.  Will he indicate the other amendments he is minded to take, as we approach the end of the debate?  We are on section 11 of a 51 section Bill and we need to know where we stand on that because this is not an adequate Committee Stage debate.I have an open mind on tagging but I remain to be convinced.  I am wary of an unproven technology but if it provides for the release of criminals without having to incarcerate them while ensuring they are no danger to the public, it may be a useful device.  I am not convinced the technology is good enough to do that.  We will return to the practicality of tagging on another occasion.

With regard to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's comments, the Home Office in Britain said that rather than diverting people away from prison, more than 80% of electronic tagging orders were used for people who would not have received custodial sentences in the first place.  That, therefore, implies an additional cost rather than a saving.  There is a presumption of innocence and, therefore, tagging represents a diminution of civil liberties.  Politicians rather than judges will have to take the cost implications into account.  In fact, Members' ability to make proposals is restricted by Standing Orders on the basis of cost.  This means that judges will impose electronic tagging orders on a wide range of people, which will constitute an additional cost.In itself, tagging will not prevent people from reoffending.  Those at whom the Minister stated this legislation is aimed, namely, major drug barons who order or organise crime empires, can so do from their homes and nothing in a tagging order will prevent this.Another problem with this measure concerns someone who is on a charge but who has a livelihood that requires him or her to move away as this would be prevented by a tagging order.  For example, fishermen and fisherwomen around the coast would be affected by this legislation.  Will such individuals be tagged to remain at home with a resultant loss of livelihood because they breached some fishing regulations?  This Bill has implications for that industry.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."As a result of the recent partnership talks on Towards 2016, it was agreed that this Bill should be enacted to provide for the establishment of a redundancy panel for the reference to it of certain proposed collective redundancies and for related action by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Members will recollect that the controversy surrounding the Irish Ferries case gave rise to this provision.The opening up of the Irish labour market arising from the decision to permit direct access by citizens of the new EU member states has given rise to concerns about the possibility of the collective compulsory replacement of workers by lower paid workers from those states or elsewhere either directly or through the use of other replacement workers within the jurisdiction.  In Towards 2016, there was agreement that this practice has the potential in certain circumstances to be harmful to the maintenance of good industrial relations.  At the same time, there was full agreement on the need for co-operation with ongoing change in response to competitive pressures, as well as the need for adaptation and flexibility when market conditions require, since they will underpin sustainable employment and conditions in enterprises.There is full recognition and acceptance that all parties to this agreement carry a responsibility to ensure their conduct is reasonable and that they act in good faith in dealing with the timely development, processing and implementation of competitive measures that may arise, as a consequence of which the best possible levels of employment and conditions can be assured.The Bill provides for the removal of the upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments.  It will also give effect to the judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Junk v. Kuhnel case regarding consultation with employees as required under Directive 98/59/EC being completed before notice of dismissal in given.  The Bill makes consequential amendments to a number of items of legislation.It is the Government's intention that the Bill be enacted quickly so that the protection it contains can be made available at the earliest opportunity.  The Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment shall arrange for the provision to the redundancy panel of all secretarial and other services necessary for its efficient operation.  The fees and expenses of the panel are expected to be minimal and are provided for in section 5.  The costs to the social insurance fund of including over 66 year olds under the Redundancy Payments Acts is estimated to be in the region of €2.4 million per annum.I would like to outline in detail the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 provide the Short Title and definitions of terms used.  The definition of "industrial action" combines the content of the definition of "strike" in section 8 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and that of "lock-out" in section 6 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  The definitions of "Minister" and "Secretary General" are self-explanatory.Section 3 provides for the duration of the panel and related matters.  Under this section, the panel has effect only for the period of three years from the commencement of this legislation.  The Minister may, by order made before the expiration of that period or of any extension of it, extend that period for a further period of three years if both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation have requested the extension and the Minister is satisfied that the continued operation of the panel would be conducive to the continued orderly conduct of industrial relations.Section 4 sets out what constitutes exceptional collective redundancies for the purposes of this Bill by reference to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  Section 5 provides for the establishment of the redundancy panel, procedures to be followed in appointing its members and their re-appointment.  The conditions of membership are also set out in this section.Section 6 provides for referral of cases to the panel by employee representatives or the employer concerned by notice given in writing and addressed to the panel's chairman.  The panel shall invite affected parties to make submissions to it in respect of the proposal.  It shall give notice in writing to the Minister that either requests him or her to seek an opinion from the Labour Court on whether the proposal is a proposal to create exceptional collective redundancies or else states that the panel is of the opinion that the conditions for the making of such a request have not been satisfied.  The panel must give a copy of that notice to the party from which the reference was received and other affected parties.The redundancy panel may not make a request to the Minister unless it appears to the panel that the proposed collective redundancies are "exceptional" collective redundancies and the panel is satisfied that, in respect of the proposal, the party from which the reference was received has unsuccessfully sought to resolve the matter through local engagement.  The panel must also be satisfied that the party from which the reference was received has acted reasonably, has not acted in a manner which has frustrated the possibility of reaching agreement to restructuring or other changes which may be deemed necessary to secure the viability of the business of the employer and has not had recourse to industrial action since the proposal was referred to it.Section 7 provides that the Minister may, within seven days of receiving a request from the redundancy panel to do so, ask the Labour Court to issue an opinion on whether the collective redundancies proposed by an employer constitute "exceptional" collective redundancies.  The Minister may also make a request the Labour Court on his own initiative if it appears to him that the proposed collective redundancies are "exceptional" collective redundancies.  The time limit in this latter case will vary depending on whether the matter has been referred to the redundancy panel.Section 8 provides for a hearing and the giving of an opinion to the Minister by the Labour Court that the proposed collective redundancies are "exceptional" collective redundancies or that it is unable to issue an opinion.  The Labour Court may not issue an opinion unless it is satisfied that the party from which the reference was received was unable to resolve the matter through local engagement and has not frustrated the possibility of agreement to restructuring, and that no industrial action on the part of that party is current.  No appeal shall result from an opinion given by the Labour Court under this section.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal can make a decision on any question referred to it under section 39 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.Section 9 provides that if the Labour Court issues an opinion that the collective redundancies proposed by an employer are exceptional collective redundancies and, having proceeded with the dismissals on the same basis as in the relevant proposal the employer applies to the Minister for a rebate under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the Minister shall have regard to the opinion of the Labour Court when considering the application for the rebate.  If the Minister refuses to pay the rebate on the basis of the Labour Court's opinion, the exemption from income tax provided by section 203 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 will not apply to lump sum payments made by the employer to employees who have been dismissed.  Section 7 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 has effect, with modifications, in the case of a dismissal that is one of a number of dismissals included in a collective redundancy that is determined by the Labour Court to be an "exceptional" collective redundancy.  The compensation payable will be such amount as is just and equitable, but it may not exceed pay for 208 weeks in the case of an employee who had not more than 20 years of continuous service, or pay for more than 260 weeks in the case of an employee who had more than 20 years of continuous service.Section 10 sets out the time limits before which dismissals may not take effect.  An employer who effects a dismissal before the expiration of the period specified in section 10(1) of this Bill, or sections 9(3) or 12(1) of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, as the case requires, will be deemed to be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to a fine up to €250,000.  Sections 11 and 14 provide for the amendment of section 2 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to update the definition of "Minister", while section 22 does the same in the case of the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, as does section 24 in the case of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.  Section 12 provides for the amendment of section 9(3) of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to reflect the decision of the European Court of Justice in the case of Junk v. Kuhnel.  Section 13 provides for the updating of penalties in the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  Section 15 provides for the amendment of section 4 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to entitle employees who have reached the age of 66 years to statutory redundancy.Section 16 provides for the amendment of section 7 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  A new subsection 7(2A) will be inserted in the 1967 Act to ensure that the dismissal of employees will not be taken to be a dismissal by reason of redundancy if the dismissal is collective and is effected on a compulsory basis, and the dismissed employees are to be replaced at the same location or elsewhere in the State by other employees who are directly employed by the employer or other people whose services are to be provided to that employer in pursuance of other arrangements where those other people perform, or are to perform, essentially the same functions as the dismissed employees, and the terms and conditions of employment of those other people are, or are to be, materially inferior to those of the dismissed employees.Section 17 provides for the amendment of section 38 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to delete references in paragraphs (a) to (c) to certain powers which are no longer required to be exercised and to authorise deciding officers to make decisions under sections 29 and 32 in respect of certain payments from the social insurance fund.  Section 18 provides for the amendment of section 39(16) of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 to eliminate the requirement that the reference of appeals to the Employment Appeals Tribunal by deciding officers be made in a particular prescribed manner.  Section 19 provides for the updating of penalties under the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, while section 21 will have a similar effect under the 1971 Act.  Section 20 provides for the repeal of section 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, which imposes an upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments and section 23 repeals section 5 of the 1979 Act.Section 25 provides for a technical amendment to be made to section 2 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977.  It reconstructs a proviso, which was inserted into section 2(2) of the 1977 Act by the Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993, within the new sections 2(2A) and 2(2B).  The proviso relates to exceptions in certain circumstances to the general non-applicability of the Unfair Dismissal Acts 1977 to 2005 to fixed-term and specified-purpose contracts.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that the exception stated in the proviso covers all the types of fixed-term and specified-purpose contracts described in section 2(2) of the 1977 Act and not simply those referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b).Section 26 provides for the amendment of section 5 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 by providing that, in cases in which all the employees who are involved in a lock-out, strike or industrial action situation are dismissed, the reasonableness or otherwise of the actions of the parties is to be taken into account in determining whether the dismissals were unfair.  Section 27 provides for the amendment of section 17 of the Employment Equality Act 1998.  Section 27(1) is a technical provision that will overcome the misdescription of an amendment that was made in 2004 and section 27(2) will insert a new section 17(4) in the 1998 Act to reflect the abolition of the upper age limit for redundancy payments.This Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad on 21 March last.  I thank the Senators for their support and their comments.  Some Senators, when speaking about the Irish Ferries situation, expressed their hope that this Bill will help prevent similar circumstances from developing on land.  The Government intends to ensure that this Bill will give an enhanced measure of protection to workers who are compulsorily made redundant in circumstances in which they are replaced by workers on lower pay or worse terms and conditions of employment.  It was pointed out in the Seanad that the payments which were made as part of the rebate paid to Irish Ferries were made on the basis of existing legislation.Specific reference was made in the Seanad to the workers at the Castlemahon plant in County Limerick who wish to claim the 40% due to the social insurance fund from the liquidation.  The Minister hopes to receive a payment as part of a preferential claim following the winding up of the company.  As he has no discretion regarding the 40% that is due to the social insurance fund, he has no legal power to divert any of the money to the employees concerned if funds are recovered.  A specific question was asked about the amount of funds currently held in the social insurance fund.  The total amount of money spent by the fund in 2006 was €6.4 billion, of which approximately €165 million was paid in respect of statutory redundancy.  Concern was expressed about the three-year term for the redundancy panel.  The Minister may extend the duration of the redundancy panel if he or she is asked to do so by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation.  A warm welcome was given in the Seanad to the decision to take the opportunity afforded by this Bill to remove the age cap of 66 years for statutory redundancy payments.I propose to make a small number of amendments to the text of the Bill on Committee Stage, mainly to reflect more accurately the wording of the agreement reached in Towards 2016.  I acknowledge the work of the social partners in addressing the problems that arise in exceptional collective redundancy situations.  The ability of the social partners to reach consensus shows the strength of the social partnership process.  I thank the officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the work they did in preparing the Bill, which I am pleased to bring before the House today.  I hope we will be able to progress it through the House expeditiously.  I look forward to hearing Members' views on the legislation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	586	Fine Gael supports the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Bill 2007.  We understand the background to the Minister of State's decision to introduce it.  The Government was forced to act following the disgraceful events at Irish Ferries.  I am disappointed that the workers at that company had to suffer before the Minister of State and his colleagues were alerted to the shady practices in question.  This legislation will help to ensure that no such practices are encountered in future.  It was unacceptable that Irish Ferries was given €4.3 million to meet the cost of making statutory redundancy payments to more than 400 Irish staff who were replaced by eastern European workers on lower pay.The Bill before the House will establish a redundancy panel, drawn from the social partners, which may ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to refer dismissals to the Labour Court to determine whether they are genuine.  It is entirely right that the Minister will be able to refuse to pay a redundancy rebate on the basis of a Labour Court decision.  This Bill is a reflection of the new challenges faced by the new Ireland.  We used to struggle to keep workers from leaving, but now we are struggling to stop the jobs we have in abundance from being devalued.Fine Gael watched the unfolding events at Irish Ferries with a growing sense of disgust.  The company's actions constituted the worst type of Dickensian exploitation we have ever seen in this country.  It should be borne in mind that Irish Ferries is an Irish company that is based in Ireland.  Therefore, it should be subject to this country's laws, including the legislation that provides for the minimum wage and the protection of employees and health and safety matters.  Some form of legal nonsense got in the way of proper industrial relations procedures.  This Bill has been introduced as a result of the actions of Irish Ferries, which was intent on maximising profits.  It was not just seeking a cheaper labour force; it was looking for a criminally cheap labour force.  We have established an industrial relations infrastructure that requires all sides to enter national agreements and to ensure give and take to allow for profitable companies and a strong enterprise culture but also decent pay for workers.  That legislation has protected Irish workers from having jobs replaced by new arrivals.  Irish Ferries has brought about a new situation that we must discuss now.  The management of Irish Ferries should have been loyal to the social partnership process and those who helped it become a profitable company.  I wonder if it can count on the loyalty of Irish people and depend on the loyalty of exporters, importers and tourists who were badly treated and inconvenienced throughout this drama.I wish to raise two industrial relations matters in my constituency, one of which has ramifications outside the constituency.  The Minister is aware of the position at Comerama.  A commitment was given by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to pay the enhanced redundancy payment arising from discussions at the national agreement.  It was agreed to review the payment of one week's wages for every year worked and increase it to two week's wages.  A commitment to include this was made in 2003 but legal matters and advice from the Attorney General subsequently prevented Comerama workers from benefitting from it.  The workers have been denied some €900,000, or €10,000 per worker because the commitment, given in the presence of Oireachtas Members in the constituency and trade union officials, was not honoured.  Despite this, SIPTU was prepared to ring-fence the problem and discuss how we could achieve most of the spirit of the agreement.  Workers and shop stewards proposed certain results in good faith, based on the commitment provided by the then Minister, but the agreement was not implemented.  Notwithstanding the number of times this matter has been examined by the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government it should be examined in the context of this Bill to provide a solution to the injustice inflicted on Castlecomer workers.  All Oireachtas Members played a meaningful part in resolving this.I am gratified that the dispute at Greencore, Mallow seems to be reaching an end following a decision by workers and the company to accept the Labour Court ruling.  It took the company a considerable period to confirm it would abide by its obligations.  The issue for beet growers remains unresolved and I regret the company has sought a judicial review.  This will have a detrimental effect on payments to growers and could also have implications for former workers at Greencore in respect of pensions.  The court case could be lengthy and will hold up payments to former Greencore staff and growers.  The factory in Carlow closed in January and we face a further delay amid continuing uncertainty about payments.  There is also concern that growers might have to pay tax on their compensation, something about which farmers are very unhappy.  Will the workers and growers be treated in a manner similar to Irish Ferries workers?  Clarification is needed.Greencore has already received 7% of the EU compensation and has seen its share price increase substantially.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure justice is done in this area.  Local authority members in Carlow and Cork should ensure the planning classification of valuable sites in those areas is put on hold until these matters are resolved.I wish to raise the issue of immigration and job displacement.  Fine Gael and Labour sought a dialogue on immigration to Ireland to ensure the seeds of resentment and racism are not sown in this country.  Events at Irish Ferries can only contribute to this.  The recent dramatic growth in the rate of immigration to Ireland is resulting in what is arguably the greatest economic and social transformation of our country since independence.  The transformation presents Ireland with both a major challenge and a major opportunity.  Given Ireland's history of emigration and migration, we have a special responsibility to address the challenge of immigration.  As Deputy Kenny stated earlier this year, as a people we understand better than most the special challenges of immigration and integrating new communities.  It is time for a real national debate on these issues so we can make the necessary changes to meet these challenges.  We have a chance to get this response right and to avoid the mistakes made elsewhere.  Immigration and multiculturalism can be good for Ireland but the current system is not being managed well.  Too many Departments and agencies are involved.  We need a system that is good for the Irish and good for the immigrants.  The current system serves the interests of neither.Fine Gael has three priorities to make immigration work for Ireland.  Immigrants have rights and responsibilities.  They should have the right to be free of discrimination and have their contribution to the country recognised but they have the responsibility to integrate into our community, comply with our laws and respect our cultural traditions.  We do not want to see a situation developing in which our immigrant population lives a separate life.  We have a responsibility to facilitate and encourage this integration.Immigration must be managed in a way that keeps Ireland safe.  We must ensure Irish laws are understood and adhered to by immigrants and Irish citizens.  We must send a strong message that people who want to come to this country to commit serious crime are not welcome and will be dealt with severely.Critically, and most importantly in the context of this Bill, immigration must be a force for improving, not threatening living standards.  We must protect Irish jobs and the rights of those who come to work here.  As a small, open economy with a population that travels freely we must ensure the benefits of Irish workers and expertise travelling worldwide and those from other countries coming here continue.  Living standards should not be threatened on either side.  Companies that pay below the minimum wage should pay severe fines, and immigration levels from non-EU countries must be explicitly linked to economic conditions and the needs of the labour market.In discussing this Bill I must address the issue of job losses and costs.  Ireland has managed to sustain significant economic growth by attracting foreign direct investment but the sequence of high-profile job losses in various multinational companies is a worrying trend.  It has become common practice for many high-profile companies to engage in global rationalisation, a code word for moving jobs from Ireland's high cost base.  Since 2001 the Government has been warned by the National Competitiveness Council of the dangerous direction that policy was taking in respect of business costs.  Nothing has been done to address the problems of energy, broadband, telecommunications, and other infrastructural problems to ensure the Irish economy is well-equipped to tackle the fierce competition we experience.  Since this Government came to power it has imposed at least 50 stealth taxes and charges on businesses and consumers.  Compared with the UK, electricity costs are 50% higher, landfill costs are 350% higher, insurance is 20% higher and broadband is 10% higher.  Meanwhile, inflation continues to rise and now stands at 4.9%.Competition from eastern Europe, India and China remains in its infancy but is likely to intensify significantly in years to come.  No Government can afford to bury its head in the sand.  All parties must consider how to cope with the enormous competition we face from overseas, in light of the burgeoning cost base in Ireland.  This is essential if are to protect the strong economic base built up over the past 20 years, including the years of the Celtic tiger.We must also ensure we are able to position Ireland as a country that can compete with other jurisdictions for the high level of graduate employment and companies that respect the Irish education system.  We must provide for the upskilling required to ensure we continue to be at the cutting edge as leaders in providing the type of labour required for many of the companies that wish to come to Ireland.  We cannot be complacent as regards low levels of unemployment because we can all see challenges on the horizon that must be dealt with effectively and in the context of ensuring that our high cost base does not continue to ratchet upwards.  Otherwise we will have redundancies to deal with, which is unsavoury and throws up enormous difficulties for the workers concerned.  Opportunities exist for people to get alternative employment, but we must ensure this continues to be the case in the event of companies finding themselves in difficulty.Our economic situation is strong.  This must continue and hopefully the potential exploitation we witness by one particular company managing to exploit a maritime law loophole can be protected by the enactment of this legislation so that the word goes out that companies which do not treat their employees properly, and where workers are exploited, will not get succour in this legislation.  The co-operation between workers and employers which has been built up over 20 years must continue so that social partnership may continue in the spirit of co-operation we have seen.  The amendments needed to sustain social partnership in the future must be brought forward in the principle of co-operation between employers and workers in the context of this legislation, as enshrined in Towards 2016, and must continue to be implemented.Fine Gael will support the legislation.  We may put forward one or two amendments to the legislation next week and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on some of the issues, which may seem somewhat parochial, given the age we live in.  I am sure, however, he will come back to me in his usual diligent manner to deal with the difficulties in Kilkenny and Carlow, in particular as regards Greencore and the Comerama workers.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	587	The Labour Party welcomes this Bill and will support it on Second Stage.  We will probably table some amendments at the appropriate stage and the Minister of State has indicated he is likely to do the same.  I therefore envisage that this Bill will have to go back to the Seanad before it is finally passed.  However, we are anxious to see it enacted before the recess and commencement of the next general election campaign because it provides a measure of cover that is welcome.We all know the genesis of the Bill is the debacle of the Irish Ferries dispute, which appalled many across the political spectrum.  It showed the negative aspects of globalisation being brought home to our doorstep.  The manner in which it was done did no credit to anyone involved.  It brought out an unprecedented number of protestors, many of whom had come on to the streets for the first time.  Many of them were in secure jobs and were in no way threatened in their employment by what had happened to the Irish Ferries workers.  However, they saw, perhaps, the dismantlement of the European social model, through a loophole in this instance.  It was an example of what could have been advanced by the Progressive Democrats and other political parties on the European stage to make "Europe more competitive", when three out of the world's five most competitive economies are Finland, Sweden and Denmark..  These countries probably have higher levels of social protection than this State and many others within the European Union.Competition and competitiveness are not exclusively about wage rates.  If that were the case Bangladesh would probably be the most competitive nation in the world.  Let us get real about this debate and strip out those people who use the word "competitiveness" as a code for cheap or low wages, or low social protections.  As we know, Irish Ferries applied to the Redundancy Fund for a sum awarded in the order of €4.5 million.  The Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe it was in that order of magnitude.  On the legal advice of the Attorney General, presumably, this was paid.  I regret that was the case and that the Government chose to take the legal advice of the Attorney General because I am sure the matter was not black and white.Frequently legal advice may be presented in a manner that makes it acceptable for a particular course of action to be taken.  I have been in similar situations where the legal advice could be read either way.  On the assumption that the advice might have been capable of being read or interpreted either way, I would have much preferred if the Government had challenged the assertion of the company and let it allow the courts decide whether it was entitled to this compensation.  That would have been a better course to take and would have given some judicial clarity to the matters for which we are now attempting to legislate.  It would, at least have delayed payment to the company in question and would have sent a signal to others contemplating similar action to the effect that the restructuring of the labour force and the downgrading of its wages and conditions would not be automatically assisted by the industrial relations and employment protection process in Ireland.However, I suspect that the presence of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that of the Minister for Health and Children had some influence on the action taken by the Government in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister of State will respond on that in terms of the nature and clarity of the legal advice because it is an important precedent for future possibilities in this area.  Certainly, it has a historical relevance that we need to get to the bottom of.I welcome, in particular, the removal of the age limit for redundancy and related payments because the nature of our workforce is such that we will have to systematically examine the entire age threshold issue in terms of entitlement.  We will have to remove the upper limit of entitlement so that we may ensure that seniors, as the politically correct would call them — I shall soon be joining that age category — can be employed should they so choose.   There was a time when we would have taken direction from the Catholic Church in this regard, which would mean that, like bishops, we could work up to the age of 72.  Given the improved states of health most of us now enjoy because of good nutrition, a better environment and more exercise, people in their 60s have become "the new 50s", according to those marketing various products, including long vacations.  For those for whom working is their sense of fulfilment and enjoyment and who are forced out of the workplace arbitrarily because they have reached a threshold, the system is wrong and should be changed.  If this Bill is a step in that overall direction, I welcome it.The complexities of the Bill, however, perturb me as much as they did my colleague in the Seanad, Senator McDowell.  If this is what the legislative creative talents of the social partners comprise, they should stick to negotiating pay deals and leave the writing of legislation to a professional Civil Service, assisted by the elected representatives in the Oireachtas and the accumulated wisdom acquired in this House.  It is a dog's dinner of a Bill in terms of drafting.  If anything, it demonstrates the absolute necessity for the consolidation of employment and labour law.  It is a quagmire beyond belief.  The Minister of State, I know, is aware of this and has no doubt attended seminars and employment conferences where literally a small employer is now at the mercy of legal blackmail.  It is a biscuit, a bar, half full, half empty in terms of the interpretation of conflicting legislation, which when overlaid with health and safety regulations or equality legislation literally is a haystack in which the possibilities for clear interpretation cannot be determined.  A small firm simply cannot take on the task of being able to fight that situation and surrenders several thousands simply by closing at 5 p.m., not knowing whether it was ever legally exposed.  I ask the Minister to acknowledge, perhaps, that consolidation is necessary.  Some efforts have been made in the area and perhaps he will update the House in his response, either on Second Stage today or later, as to where we stand in this regard.I have a final point, following on Deputy Hogan's contribution.   The Labour Party Member for Waterford, Deputy O'Shea, received from Mr. Sean Kelly, the regional industrial organiser for the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union, representations regarding workers in the Castlemahon poultry plant.  The main contract for the plant was shifted by the owners, the O'Kane Group, out of the jurisdiction to Ballymena, Northern Ireland, where operating and labour costs are much more competitive than in the Republic.  A certain number of voluntary redundancies were obtained in the cost-cutting exercise.  The workers in question, in addition to the two-week statutory payment, received a three-week addition to their payments by the O'Kane Group.The attempt at reducing operating costs did not prove to be effective and the company subsequently went into liquidation.  Under labour law, the liquidator was compelled to provide a statutory redundancy and no more to the remaining workforce because preferential treatment cannot be shown to an individual creditor.There is great talk of creating an all-Ireland economy between now and 6 May.  It is unacceptable if we follow the logic of this political euphoria that a plant can be moved from west Limerick to the North of Ireland and avail of an Irish Ferries mark II scenario.  If the plant had moved to County Wicklow, it would not have happened.  If a company goes into liquidation yet the owner has transferred the contract, there must be some degree of continuity.  I suspect this falls between company and labour law.As Deputy Hogan stated, if we want Irish workers to buy into a sustained support for an open trans-frontier single market in the EU which carries and shares the burdens of competition and opportunity, these types of sharp practices must be shut down.  Any junior certificate student doing business organisation would recognise the sharp practice involved in the Castlemahon case.  The O'Kane Group, which is still in existence, must be told that some form of additional payment should be made to the remaining workers, comparable to those who took the early redundancy 12 months before the company went into liquidation.I accept this is not close to the Bill but it does arise because of the perceived inequities in the ways some workers are treated under existing labour law for redundancies and the difference between liquidation and voluntary redundancy.  It is up to Members to respond to this.  The social partners might be much better employed in turning their attention to these real-life conflicts rather than attempting to second-guess the Legislature with a draft Bill.  In the past, the tradition was that politicians stayed out of industrial relations disputes and the trade unions and employers stayed out of the legislative process.  I see a blurring of that traditional convention.  If this Bill is the quality of the legislation that comes from it, we should see no more of it.

For example, access to medical facilities is free of charge, paid for through general taxation.  House prices are not roaring ahead as they are in this State. An all-Ireland economy, with harmonised taxation on the island and some of the social protections available in the North brought into this State are some ways of tackling these issues.  The sooner that happens, the better for all workers on this island.  Speed the day.Sinn Féin welcomes the Bill as it has been needed for some time.  It has arisen out of the disgraceful Irish Ferries dispute of little over a year ago.  More than 500 Irish workers were given a payment that was masked as a voluntary redundancy when they were actually coerced into accepting it.Under the Redundancy Payments Acts, redundancy does not merely arise where a business closes or an employer reduces the size of the workforce.  The definition includes circumstances where the employer decides different or additional skills and qualifications are required for a job.  With the 500 Irish Ferries redundancies, the business neither closed down nor did management downsize its operation.  The same number of workers are with Irish Ferries now as before the lay-offs.  The management successfully managed to replace Irish seafarers with more than 500 low-paid, non-unionised workers from eastern Europe.  To top it off, the Government subsidised this callous exercise by giving Irish Ferries €4.3 million from taxpayers' pockets.This colossal sum of money was paid to a company which claimed it needed to make over 500 crew members redundant to make the company directly more competitive.  This is the same company that gives its chief executive, Eamonn Rothwell, 2.5% of the company's earnings and an annual bonus of over €420,000.  This legislation is long overdue to prevent an Irish Ferries on land scenario occurring.While Sinn Féin welcomes the Bill, there are some concerns over some provisions.  Section 3(1) states the exceptional collective redundancy section will only last for three years.  There is no reason to allow for this three-year trial period.  There is nothing to indicate that at the end of the trial period, industrial arrangements will be such as to not require the provisions of the Bill.  It is pathetic that the redundancies panel, as envisaged in the Bill, can only continue if IBEC wishes it to do so.  A body that represents employers in this State should never have a veto over legislation that has been designated with the aim of protecting workers.  After the Irish Ferries debacle, workers certainly need protecting.  Another issue that raises an element of disquiet is contained in section 10(3) that specifies:An employer who effects a dismissal in pursuance of a proposal for collective redundancies before the expiration of such of the periods specified in subsection (1) and in sections 9(3) and 12(1) of the Protection of Employment Act 1977 as are applicable is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €250,000.Given that Irish Ferries has stated the redundancy package cost its parent company, the Irish Continental Group, €29.1 million, a fine of €250,000 seems paltry.  I will seek to amend this section.Section 15, which provides for the amendment of section 4 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, is welcome.  This will enable employees who have reached the age of 66 years to be entitled to statutory redundancy payments.  Sinn Féin has long campaigned for the abolition of this discriminatory provision.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	591	Before I go into the details of the legislation and since we are dealing with employment protection issues, I commend Steve Staunton and the Irish football team on last night's win in Croke Park.  They have got six points in five days and are third in their qualifying group.  To the whingers like Eamon Dunphy, Johnny Giles and Roy Keane, I say they should leave Steve Staunton alone, let him get on with his contract and secure his employment.  He is trying to do his best for his country.The Bill provides for the establishment of a redundancy panel for the reference to it of certain proposed collective redundancies and for related action by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It also provides the removal of the upper age limit for entitlement to redundancy payments, makes consequential amendments to the Protection of Employment Act 1977, the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967, 1971 and 1979, the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 and the Employment Equality Act 1998 and makes further amendments to those Acts to update penalties and in other formal respects.Section 2 provides definitions of terms used in the Act.  The definition of "industrial action" combines the content of the definition of "strike" in section 8 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and of "lock-out" in section 6 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  I raise those definitions covered in section 2 because the issue of industrial action, strikes and so on seems to have gone off the political agenda in recent years.  While for the vast majority of people it is a positive development, we also want to ensure trade unions are not losing their grip and control when it comes to the issue of industrial relations.  Sadly, there are thousands of workers in this State who are not members of trade unions, which is regrettable for our society and economy.  We all support the trade union movement in developing a trade union that is interested in the common good.  Let us re-evaluate and reflect on the positive aspects of James Connolly's teachings on these issues.  There seems to be anti-trade union mood in the wider society and particularly among right wing elements here.As trade unionists it is essential we support the most vulnerable sections of society, particularly children.  To the shame of all of us Ireland has one of the highest child poverty rates in Europe.  Some 10% of our children go out in the morning without proper food or warm winter clothing.  The mental health services for children are inadequate or non-existent.  Access to speech and language therapists is extremely limited for children with disabilities.  Pre-school facilitates are extremely expensive.  Some children still live in substandard buildings in 2007.  This is not acceptable.I use this opportunity to commend my union, the INTO, on its magnificent campaign in recent weeks to promote class sizes of 20:1.  It put the class size issue on the political agenda.  This is an example of a trade union that is working with parents and teachers and putting pressure on politicians to deliver something that is good for our children and is also an excellent investment in education.I point out to my friends and comrades in the trade union movement that it is important we do not forget the poorer sections of society.  We have seen huge price increases in vegetables, fruit, gas and electricity and a 15% increase in rents for Dublin City Council tenants, particularly for those living on the north side of Dublin and for pensioners.  I call on the Minister of State and the Government to assist, as a matter of priority, our elderly, people with disabilities and working people in general as these huge price increases make it extremely difficult for them to cope and they affect their quality of life.  A number of pensioners I met the other night expressed concern about the high rate of VAT on many household items.Reference was made to the debate about the wider issue of the all-island economy.  There are positive and sensible developments in regard to this issue and it is constructive to have an all-island economy.  I would like the trade union movement, North and South, to work more closely together.  I use this opportunity to commend the brave trade unions which stood out against sectarian violence on this island for 30 years; they did a noble job and some of them paid the price for doing so.  We should not be afraid to say that in this debate.Section 7 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 has effect, with modifications, in regard to a dismissal that is one of a number of dismissals included in a collective redundancy that is determined by the Labour Court to be an exceptional collective redundancy.  The compensation payable is such amount as is just and equitable but may not exceed pay for 208 weeks for an employee who had no more than 20 years' continuous service or, in the case of an employee who had more than 20 years' continuous service, pay for more than 260 weeks.  When referring to this issue, I wish to raise the issue of the potential loss of jobs.  I pay tribute to constituents of mine who work in Cadbury's factory in Dublin.  I ask the Minister of State be vigilant about this issue because many workers are concerned about the potential loss of their jobs to low-wage economies.I welcome this opportunity put forward a trade union perspective on this Bill.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I wish, on behalf of the Green Party, to indicate general support for the intent and delivery of this Bill.  I hope we can provide for its swift passage through the Houses with possible amendments.I agree with Deputy Quinn that the Bill is complex and when amending it, as in the case of all legislation, one has to refer to existing legislation, in this case the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  In reading the Bill I searched for a simple definition of what an exceptional collective redundancy might be.  I was drawn to section 4 which sets out a definition but does define it.  It refers back to the principal legislation which is later amended in section 16 of this Bill in a manner that is very difficult to define.  That is important because the case in hand that led to this legislation is clear, namely the Irish Ferries dispute.  There is a widespread perception that this case had huge ramifications in this State and it led to a number of people protesting about it, perhaps because to a certain extent it was a focal point for a general sense of lack of ease in our State as to whether we had control on the type of development that was occurring or that we were losing control in terms of the economy we were developing.  In a sense it represented those fears in a practical and clear example.In the maritime area of trading there are specific conditions.  First, there is the lack of any real control in terms of the ILO Maritime Convention not having been signed and the EU directive on manning conditions for ferries not having been put in force.  Particular circumstances apply where a workforce could be working in one state and located in another.  The difficulty in reading the legislation is understanding exactly what other circumstances to which this may apply.While that is a small point, I agree with Deputy Quinn that the partnership process has been beneficial for certain developments in our society.  As to whether it should become the legislative body for our State is very much in question.  On a number of occasions during the five years since I was elected to this House, I have seen legislation primarily coming out of partnership discussions rather than from a Department, Government or a party in this House.  When I read through those Bills, I sometimes had concerns that such discussions were not a good source for legislative change.  By all means they should have an influence and a role but them being the primary driver and author of legislation comes across to me as complicated and not particularly clear.An example of those concerns — this is not to raise a major criticism — is the slight concern I have that we are setting up a complicated procedure.  I stand to be corrected, but in layman's language the way I envisage this procedure working is that a request would be sent to the Secretary General of the Department to investigate a matter, he or she would notify the Minister who would refer it to the redundancy panel we are establishing, and it would return to the Minister with a suggestion that it might be referred to the Labour Court, which might make a recommendation and which could be appealed to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I do not know whether that is a fair summary of the procedures that would be involved.  That process is pretty complicated.

I hope the criticism I voiced will be taken constructively.I agree with Deputy Quinn on another matter.  As a small employer in the past, I appreciate it is incredibly difficult for an enterprise with fewer than 200 or 300 employees to have the scale and ability to follow in a meaningful way some of the employment legislation we draft and the regulations in place to comply with them in the first instance and, second, to follow the procedures established under them.  In nine times out of ten it is not worth the trouble of pursuing the proper procedures and they hope to get out of it in whatever way they can.  The same could apply to workers who may not have trade union representation or the collective might to achieve a just and correct settlement.  There is a need to amalgamate employment legislation and to introduce new legislation that is not a difficult regulatory burden on either employers or workers acting collectively.I do not share the concerns about the three-year review and legislation can easily be amended further if there is amalgamation of employment legislation.The issue is important because there are different difficulties in every work situation and there are cases of entire companies being transferred.  We need to be concerned about what is happening in the economy.  I refer to the case of a national newspaper where there is a proposal to dispense with a section of the business by means of a redundancy process and the setting up of a contract agency to provide the same function.  This may be beneficial in terms of a more flexible enterprise culture but it may also allow for certain practices of concern such as the drafting in of labour standards which are below the desired standard.  I do not wish to imply this applies to the case to which I have referred but there is a general concern that the migration of cheap labour combined with lower labour standards may not just apply in the high profile cases but may also apply in many other cases.  It is important to have definition and clarity and I look forward to teasing out these issues on Report Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House and give it my party's support.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	599	Deputy Hogan and everybody else raised the issue of Irish Ferries and the new challenges faced by this country and the economy concerning the devaluation of jobs.  I will deal with this issue in more detail when I address the points raised by Deputy Quinn which are very specific.Deputy Hogan and others also raised the question of the loyalty of the workers of Irish Ferries.  It appears that despite all the concerns the company appears to continue to enjoy the support of many of the exporters and others who use its services such as Irish people and tourists, which is somewhat strange, in my view.   He also raised the issue of the Comerama workers and the difficulties relating to their redundancy payments.  Deputy Quinn and others including myself have attended meetings on this issue.  The workers understood they had been given an undertaking about the enhanced redundancy.  A number of difficulties arose.  Approximately six months elapsed between the closure of Comerama and the introduction of the increased rates of statutory redundancy.  During that time a considerable number of other workers, in excess of 12,000, became redundant.  It would have been impossible to introduce the enhanced rates for the Comerama workers and not make them available to the other workers whose redundancy occurred during that interim period.  By extension, this also raised issues to do with other workers who had been made redundant at previous stages during interim periods and it became impossible to deal with it.  To ring-fence a specific scheme for Comerama workers became impossible even though many of us would have wished it were different.  I know the disappointment of the Members from Carlow-Kilkenny and others feel about similar situations.Deputy Hogan raised a number of issues about Greencore, some relating to the outcome for workers and others relating to the outcome for growers in both Carlow and Mallow.  Members will be aware of the difficulties which arose over a long period of time, from 26 April of last year when the issue was first adjudicated on by the Labour Court.  Subsequent clarifications did not advance matters very far since management were not moving from a particular interpretation.  Fortunately some progress has been made in recent days and both sides returned to the Labour Court on 19 February for additional talks.  I understand that the original difference between the two sides which would have amounted to approximately €4.4 million has been somewhat divided and is slightly higher than the half-way stage in terms of the workers' perception of what they needed.  I understand a resolution may be on the way.I am unsure of what implications are feared by Deputy Hogan for the Carlow workers as I understand their situation had been resolved previously but I will return to the Deputy if I have any new information.  He also raised the important question of the migration of work.  It is imperative we protect Irish jobs and those of others who have worked in our economy.  He referred to high profile job losses in the context of global rationalisation over which a small open economy such as this has little influence.  Such an economy has great difficulty in setting terms which it can stand over.The redundancy figures for 2006 amount to approximately 24,500 which is similar to the previous year and lower than two years prior.  Despite the publicity surrounding job losses the out turn for the first two months of this year are 2% higher than last year which is similar to 2005 and lower than the two previous years.  There does not seem to be a pattern of much higher levels of redundancy and this is against a background of job creation rates of 85,000 last year and economic growth of approximately 6% last year which is very positive.  Nevertheless I take the Deputy's point that there are new challenges with regard to competitiveness and to cost base, which we sometimes place as the only factor when, as Deputy Quinn stated, there are many other factors such as productivity and the other advantages enjoyed by people who have the benefit of an Irish workforce.  Because we hear all the negative stories, we tend to forget that there are very positive elements regarding the input of Irish workers, which is all the more reason we in this House should be willing to put legislative change in place to defend those workers and their rights.Deputy Quinn asked a number of questions about Irish Ferries and also referred to the negative effects of globalisation.  He asked specific questions about the redundancy fund which paid some €4.5 million to Irish Ferries.  I can assure Deputy Quinn that the Minister, Deputy Martin and I considered the legal advice very carefully.  We considered many options including those referred to by the Deputy, some of which in political terms would have been a lot more attractive than paying.  However, on the basis of the existing legislative position and the legal advice regarding it, there did not appear to be any justification to let the matter go to the court or to refer it onwards to the Employment Appeals Tribunal which in certain circumstances might have been an option.  Having carefully considered the information supplied by Irish Ferries and additional information which was sought from it and the legislative framework, there really was no option but to pay the rebate on the basis of the current legislation.  This is one of the reasons that this piece of legislation is even more vital.Deputy Quinn and a number of other speakers referred to the social partners and their positive role in many areas of life.  He harboured some doubts about their capacity to write legislation.  The Deputy will be less than pleased when he sees some of the amendments I propose to introduce because they reflect more closely the terms of the Towards 2016 partnership agreement.  Both sides of the partnership have made strong representations to the effect that what we have done in the legislation does not mirror exactly what was agreed in the agreement.The function of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to enact legislation.  I am aware that some of our colleagues — neither the Acting Chairman nor Deputy Quinn is among them — are strongly of the view that only people elected to the Houses of Parliament should have a direct involvement in the drafting of legislation or an influence on such legislation.  I have come to appreciate that the social partnership model has achieved a number of things.  It has enhanced the model of democracy that operates in this country and ensured the inclusion of many who would otherwise have been excluded from the process.  While I sometimes vehemently disagree with some of the proposals  made by one side or the other — sometimes both — it is a particular advantage to our democratic system that ideas are fed through from the social partners.  Ultimately, however, it is the responsibility of the Dáil and the Upper House to ensure we have good legislation.  If social partnership were diminishing the powers of the Houses in that regard, we would have reason to be concerned and the matter would have to be addressed.

When I was appointed to this position two years ago, I thought that what the Deputy suggests was one of the most urgent jobs that needed to be done.  In the interim, events involving Gama, Irish Ferries and other companies have thrown up the need for urgent legislation such as that before the House.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I appreciate that.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I hope my successor, when various items of legislation have been enacted either later this year or early next year, will have an opportunity to consolidate the various items of labour law.  If he or she does not do so, it will become impossible for even the most experienced practitioner to know exactly what is involved.  As a result, the effect of the legislation and the benefits that might arise on foot of it would undoubtedly be diminished to some degree.There is a commitment in Towards 2016 to a number of items of legislation and I will outline the position in respect of them.  The Work Permits Act has been in operation since 1 February.  I hope the Bill before us will be enacted in the near future.  A huge amount of work is ongoing in the restatement of the Unfair Dismissals Acts.  I had hoped we would deal with the employment agency regulation Bill during the lifetime of this Parliament but, sadly, that will not prove to be the case.  The employment law compliance Bill is important legislation and must be enacted before we commence the process of consolidation.  I strongly agree with the Deputy that a consolidation of labour law is necessary.On Castlemahon poultry, I take the point in respect of the all-Ireland economy.  The logic behind moving a firm from Limerick to Antrim and treating workers as badly as the O'Kane Group treated those at Castlemahon really rankles with me.  It would rankle with anyone who examines the implications, particularly in view of the fact that voluntary redundancy packages were on offer a short period before the move was announced.  When one takes account of this matter and the fact that a huge proportion of the existing market in this area is to be found on the southern part of the island, it is immensely frustrating that the initial proposal — it was entirely illegal — put to us was that we should consider allocating whatever moneys that were returned to the fund at the end of the liquidation process to the workers.  It is not too much to ask that the O'Kane Group should address its responsibilities in respect of this matter in a much more forthright and robust manner than has heretofore been the case.  We tried to drive that message home to the company but sadly with no great success.This matter has upset many.  In a future era when there is more co-operation between North and South and among countries across the European Union, it would be very much in everyone's interests if companies were not allowed to move operations from one part of this island to another or from one region of Europe to another.  The latter was the case as regards Irish Ferries and its mistreatment of certain people.  Whoever represents Ireland at meetings of the EU Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the European Commission in the future will have a responsibility to try to progress matters in this regard.  If this matter is not dealt with, in the short term people in a small open economy such as Ireland could well be the first victims.  However, everyone will eventually be picked off.  It is, therefore, in everybody's interests that this matter is addressed.Deputy Morgan also referred to Irish Ferries.  He made a valid point in respect of section 3(1) of the Bill and the three-year trial period following enactment.  The Minister of the day will be empowered to extend this provision, ideally with the agreement of the social partners.  If, however, one of the social partners were to come forward with a veto in respect of something that was working well, the legislative provisions and the powers of the House would be invoked in order to ensure this could not take effect.On section 10(3), Deputy Morgan stated the fine of €250,000 was paltry.  This amount represents a huge increase on the current figure of €3,000.  I am aware that Deputy Quinn is of the opinion that the fine should be levied per employee.  Deputy Morgan's point regarding the fine's impact in the context of the overall costs relating to the Irish Ferries case appears to make the amount quite small.  I will consider the matter prior to Committee Stage.  We are increasing the fine from €3,000 to €250,000.  I will keep an open mind on the subject but I am not making any guarantees in that regard.Deputy Finian McGrath made the point that industrial action appeared to be if not quite off the agenda, then close to being so.  While he expressed some reservations, everyone would agree that this is generally a positive development.  I agree strongly with his disappointment regarding the relatively small level of union membership in Ireland.  The added representation that individual workers would enjoy under the social partnership framework if they were members of trade unions would be a great development and the benefit this would have, in both directions, for the workplace would be extraordinary.  I hope we will see some developments in this regard.  To be fair to the social partners, Towards 2016 contains a major consideration in respect of the life cycle.  That is a positive development.Deputy Finian McGrath also referred to Cadburys.  We have been following that matter closely and I assure him that anything that can be done will be done.Deputy Eamon Ryan made the point that he had difficulty following some of elements of the definitions.  I was conscious, in the light of the speed with which I made my initial contribution, that I was not making it any easier for people to understand what was involved.  The Deputy also referred to the ILO maritime provisions and the EU ferries directive which will definitely have to be put in place if progress is to be made.Deputy Eamon Ryan indicated that he had some concerns about social partnership gaining responsibility for legislative provision.  I would sometimes be a little more pleased if legislative proposals emanated from within the country at social partnership level rather than coming from the outside in the form of EU directives.  In most cases, however, the impact of such directives has been to move us to where we should be much more quickly than would be the case if we were left to our own devices.  That has been a positive development.

The aim of this initiative is to transfer private activity from within the public hospital system to new privately-financed and managed facilities and thereby free up approximately 1,000 additional beds for public patients.The Health Service Executive is at an advanced stage in a public procurement process on the co-location of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals.  I understand that the HSE proposes to issue invitations to tender to the short-listed bidders in the next few days and that tenders are to be returned by the end of April.  The HSE will then evaluate the tenders and the successful bidders should be selected in May.  Following that a "standstill" period of two weeks is required by procurement law before project agreements can be signed with the successful bidders.There will be a rigorous value for money assessment of all proposals.  Any transaction will be on a commercial basis and will fully protect the public interest.  In addition, there will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice.

In case we do not get that opportunity again, I wish her well in the election.As the Minister will be aware, there is outright opposition from my party to the co-location plan.  It is a bad plan.  I dislike the way the Minister is going about it.  She should not sign these contracts unless she has a new consultants' contract.  I want to know will that be the case and will she hold off on signing this.  I am also concerned that the HSE has full authority in this regard.  If that is what she is stating, the HSE could sign these contracts on the day of the election, regardless of what the Government elected that day feels about this.  That is a frightening concept.The Minister is turning her back on the public health care system in seeking this solution and we need to look at a few matters in that regard.  First, I ask the Minister to clarify the full costs of this to the taxpayer.  If the public system had to pay for these beds it would cost approximately €1 billion.  The Minister states that the solution delivers these 1,000 beds in a roundabout way to the taxpayer for €400 million, which is the amount of the tax concessions she is giving for the construction of these private hospitals.  Has she taken into account the €286 million estimated in 2007 in charges for maintenance in private and semi-private accommodation in public hospitals and how will this €286 million be replaced for the taxpayer, who must now make up that shortfall within the €14 billion that is spent on the public health care system?More importantly, it brings to mind what the Taoiseach stated in December last when BUPA was pulling out of Ireland, that he was not going to let BUPA screw the old people.  In this situation, because the Minister is not dealing with reforming the public system and making it work, one can see from the Health vote which we dealt with on Wednesday last that each person pays a significant amount of money.  We are paying €4.9 billion——

#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	616	What will this cost the private patient in the long term?  The private patient will now end up paying not only €268 million which will be transferred to the private sector but, according to Mr. Finn when he was in front of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, probably double that figure.  Does the Minister accept that private patients may find their premiums increasing dramatically because a sum in excess of €500 million will be required?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	617	First, I thank Deputy Twomey for his good wishes for the forthcoming election.  I am not certain we will not have another health Question Time before the Taoiseach goes to the President to dissolve the Dáil.  I return his compliments and wish him and all the spokespersons well in the election.The purpose of this policy is to free up approximately 1,000 beds that are ring-fenced for private patients to use for public patients.  The capital cost of providing these beds in a co-located facility is less than 50% of the traditional cost.  The cost to the eight hospitals of not getting the money from the insurers is €96 million, as we heard yesterday from Mr. Finn.  Therefore, we get 1,000 beds for €96 million.  That is incredible value relative to the cost of financing beds.  Of course, the reason for that is the nurses, the managers, the administrators, all the people who work with the diagnostics, etc. are already on the public payroll.I do not understand an approach that favours capital allowances for private hospitals but not if they are beside public hospitals.  The reason for this plan is to free up these beds.  It is also to keep the doctors on site.  It is not an efficient use of key manpower in the health care system to have doctors working in two, three or four hospitals.  Travel time alone is an issue.  There are a great many issues involved.The idea here is that one is supposed to complement the other.  In Waterford, Sligo and other places, as Deputy Twomey heard, they will use the same entrance.  These hospitals, by virtue of the tax allowances, must make services available for public patients at a discounted price.  They must accept all patients, not just private patients, from the accident and emergency department.  There will be service level agreements between the public and private providers where they will work with each other.  They will share profits with the public hospital.  This is a win, win situation.  That is why it is so strongly supported in all those hospitals.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	619	The greatest guarantor of keeping the cost of health insurance down is competition.  One does not keep the cost of health insurance down by restricting the capacity of private beds.  If one does that, one is insuring people who cannot get services.  That does not make sense.  In all markets competition drives innovation and keeps prices down.  That is why I welcome the entry to the Irish market of Quinn Direct.  As there is a question about insurance, I will deal with that matter then.  The changes we must make here to make this market more competitive will guarantee that all consumers with private health insurance get better value for money.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	620	First, is the Minister aware that there is significant public and, indeed, professional opposition to this project, that she does not have a mandate for what she is doing and that it is surely better practice to ensure that the election is held before any irrevocable decisions are made?Second, I challenge her statement here that the aim of this plan is to transfer private activity and ask her how she intends to do that.  Every patient in the State has an entitlement to a public bed.  The vast majority of patients, regardless of whether they are public or private, who come into public hospitals come through accident and emergency departments.  If a private patient gets a bed in a public hospital, how does she intend to remove him or her?What exactly is the loss of funding that will be experienced by public hospitals, which will still see some private patients in beds but will not be able to charge them for those beds?  I note, for example, that Beaumont Hospital stated in its most recent report that 40% of its private capacity was used to provide for emergency and isolation cases.Will the Minister outline the exact position with regard to the consultants' contracts?  Does she expect the contracts to allow consultants to work in both types of hospital and to provide private and public care, as is currently the case?  How will that be different from the current arrangement, apart from the distance factor?  Will she make the terms of the tender available to the Members of this House?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	621	I do not accept that I have no mandate.  The Government made a policy decision in 2005 and it is a matter for the HSE to implement it.  We do not put the implementation of policy on hold in advance of or during elections.Everybody is entitled to access the public hospital system.  Universal coverage is available in Ireland, which is not the case in other places.  At present, however, not everybody accesses the system on the same basis.  Those with private health insurance — I understand Deputy McManus published data in that regard — have easier access to the public hospital system, which is not good.  I believe everybody should be equal and that is why I disagree with, for example, charges for accident and emergency services.  When it comes to the public hospital system, which we are all entitled to use, we should allow access based on medical need and not because some of us have insurance and therefore can get into beds that are ring-fenced for private patients.  Recently, I wrote to the HSE to recommend the prioritisation of these beds, many of which are in small or single rooms, for infection control purposes where necessary.With regard to the charge to the hospitals, I said in my reply to Deputy Twomey that the eight hospitals concerned received €96 million last year for the beds being moved from public to private hospitals.  That figure will be the revenue cost to the hospitals, excluding the moneys raised from leasing the land, which exceeds the commercial valuation because of the advantages offered by collocation.The current contract of employment for consultants, which cannot be broken other than by agreement, gives consultants the right to 20% private practice on public hospital sites.  In all eight hospitals, the intention is that the consultations will carry out work on the site and not in the public hospital, in line with their contract.  We are seeking to negotiate a new contract with the consultants and the Government extended the period for negotiations by a further three weeks to 17 April because of the optimism expressed by the chairman of the talks.  We want to see public-only contracts for public hospitals, which I understand has been well received, and a range of other contracts.  Certain existing contracts will have to be red-circled because they cannot be broken except by agreement.  I hope we can have a new contract of employment which attracts many of the existing consultants to work in teams under clinical directors and to provide greater flexibility, longer days and different rosters, all of which have been very successful in other hospitals around the world.

There are a number of bidders on each site and the HSE is following the new procedures introduced by the Department Finance of negotiating in advance.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The issues of nurses' pay and working hours have been fully processed through the State's industrial relations structures and procedures, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  While health service management has accepted the Labour Court recommendation, the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association state they have neither accepted nor rejected this recommendation and have instead served notice of industrial action.The INO and PNA had been due to commence industrial action on 12 March.  This action would have involved a nationwide work-to-rule and short work stoppages.  Following contacts between Government representatives and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, it was agreed to put in place an intensive time bound process of engagement under the aegis of the national implementation body, NIB, to address the issues underpinning the dispute and take account of the relevant Labour Court recommendations.  The INO and PNA agreed to postpone their industrial action until 2 April.The talks commenced on 12 March and are due to conclude tomorrow.  In addition to the INO and the PNA, SIPTU, which is not in dispute, is represented at the talks.  The negotiations concentrate on two main issues: the claim for a reduction in the working week from 39 to 35 hours and the perceived pay anomaly in the intellectual disability sector.  The NIB has requested both sides to refrain from public comment on the discussions while the process is ongoing, and this has been agreed by the parties.  At the end of this week, a detailed position statement is due to be prepared by the NIB and presented to both sides for their consideration.  I believe this process is the best prospect of finding a satisfactory solution and officials from my Department and the HSE are fully and positively engaged in the process.

Does the Minister accept the INO is also positively engaged and has made an enormous contribution to our health service?  Does she agree nurses are the backbone of the health service in many ways?I was struck by the Minister's reply to a previous question which impacts on this matter.  Did she state nurses in private hospitals will be on the public payroll?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	630	No.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	631	Clarification is needed on this because she cited Sweden as an example in the comments she made yesterday to the Select Committee on Health and Children.  Is it correct that some of the nursing facilities in Sweden are provided by the private sector?  The INO is not enthusiastic about the proposal to co-locate hospitals.  Will the nurses who operate in these hospitals act in a private capacity and will they be members of trade unions?  Does the Minister foresee any difficulties in that regard?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I agree that nurses are the backbone of the health system.  They represent 35% of those who work in the system and are there 24-hours per day, seven days per week.  They spend considerably longer periods with hospital patients than any other group of workers and do a fantastic job.  In recent years, we have elevated nursing to a graduate level profession, with eight applicants for every place, and have greatly increased the number of nurses.  I am a strong fan of enhancing the role of nurses and that is why I recently provided for nurse prescribing.With regard to the private hospital initiative, all the nurses who care for patients in private beds in public hospitals are on the public payroll, so we will not have to employ additional nurses or incur further payroll costs.  To the best of my knowledge, the nurses who work in the private health system have the same pay and conditions and belong to the same trade unions as public nurses.  I am not aware of any issues in that regard.  It is not for me to decide whether a facility is unionised but I do not think anyone is suggesting that freedom of association should be curtailed.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	633	I wanted a transcript of Mr. Finn's presentation.  Under the Minister's proposal, it is interesting that private operators can provide these services at a cheaper rate.  Could they also, therefore, provide public beds at a cheaper rate?  Could public beds not be built using private operators?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Building costs are the same but that is not the issue.  I visited Sweden where I met the managers of St. Goran's Hospital.  It used to be managed by the state until the socialist government transferred its management to the private sector.  The private company received the same amount the year it took over as the government had provided the previous year.  Not only did the company make a profit but it exceeded all its targets.  No issues or difficulties have arisen with the employees.  I made a reference yesterday to doing that here and the hullabaloo that would result.  I am not even contemplating it but governments all over Europe are doing this.  For example, hospitals have been transferred in France, Germany and the Netherlands.All beds are built by private contractors and, whether they are contracted by the State or privately, the construction costs do not differ.  However, the issue is the cost of running the beds and the speed at which they can be delivered.  We have an endless public procurement process and projects such as schools take a considerable period from the time the green button is pressed until completion.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	635	It is my objective to have an effective national cervical screening programme rolled out, beginning late this year.  The programme will provide free cervical screening for women in the 25 to 60 year age group nationally and aims to reduce mortality from cervical cancer by up to 80%.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a national cancer screening service, which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish cervical screening programme.  The total allocation to the new service is €33 million which is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the programmes.  This includes additional funding of €5 million for 2007 for the service to commence the roll-out of the programme by the end of the year.  The national cancer screening service plans to have cervical screening managed as a national call-recall programme.  This will be done through effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, including call-recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.

Does the Minister accept Irish women are dying at a rate twice the European average from cervical cancer?  Our cervical cancer rate is higher than the UK even though when the programme was proposed in 1997 our rate was half that of the UK.  Does she accept that in the past ten years little or nothing has been done in this regard?  Could she be realistic about what will happen in the future given that a patient registration scheme is not in place and she does not know how much that would cost?  The Minister referred to an additional allocation of €5 million but I do not know where that money will go.  The HSE is still working on a report on laboratory capacity.  When will that be presented, given that it will take another year at least if there is a need to build capacity?It is ten years since the Minister for Health decided to set up this programme and the cervical cancer rate among Irish women has dramatically increased during that decade but nothing has been done to address it.  Smear tests were sent to the US during 2006, which means capacity is a problem in our system, particularly when women must wait six months for test results.  Will the Minister be realistic in outlining how long it will take to implement a cervical cancer screening programme?  It is amazing that the rate of cervical cancer among Irish women exceeds that in the UK, given it was half that in 1997.  That is the reason we must move quickly on this.  Nothing the Minister said in her reply gives me confidence that she understands how far behind we are and the serious consequences involved, especially in protecting women who are most at risk.

I do not disagree with much of the Deputy's contribution.  Cervical smear testing was introduced in Canada in the late 1960s while it was introduced in the UK in 1988.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	638	It was also introduced in the UK in the 1960s but the programme was reviewed in 1988 to upgrade it.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	639	Since 1988, results in the UK have improved.  Approximately 73 women a year die from cervical cancer in Ireland, even though significant numbers of opportunities for smears are conducted.  There is a number of issues.  The HSE did not go to tender because of the emergency resulting from a five-month backlog for such tests.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	640	On a point of order, I was informed the reason the HSE did not go to tender was there was no capacity in any laboratory in Europe.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	641	It was done to speed up the process on an emergency basis because generally one is required to go to tender.  Two issues are involved relating to capacity and quality.  We all accept BreastCheck is a quality assured programme.  It must be ensured cervical screening is quality assured and, therefore, that the laboratories are accredited and meet the standard required, which has not been the case in many instances to date.  The HSE has appointed a group to examine laboratory capacity and I am not sure when it is due to report.  However, whether domestic laboratories will be available or we have to continue to outsource, that will be done.  Staff must be recruited for the new programme.  It takes a long time from agreeing the policy to writing to women to come forward for smear tests but that will happen later this year.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	642	The Minister is almost in agreement with my comments.  The Government's commitment to the cervical screening programme is weak.  No progress has been made on patient registration and the Minister has no idea how women who need smear tests will be identified.  She has acknowledged the HSE has no idea what is the laboratory capacity in this regard.  These are two basic issues before one considers where sufficient doctors and nurses are available to conduct the tests and whether additional investment is needed in colposcopy clinics.  That highlights a serious lack of commitment, ten years after the programme was proposed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	643	We know the age group and the programme will operate similarly to BreastCheck.  Everybody accepts that is a terrific programme and the same people will be responsible for the cervical screening programme.  When a screening programme is rolled out, quality assurance is essential.  The roll-out will begin later this year and it will take a while to roll it out to the entire population.  The programme will cover approximately 250,000 women annually.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	644	I am familiar with difficulties that have recently arisen both in Cork and in Drogheda regarding the provision of maternity services.  As the House will be aware, the new state-of-the-art Cork University Maternity Hospital was due to open last Saturday but did not because of non co-operation on the part of the Irish Nurses Organisation, which has been claiming that midwifery staffing levels at the hospital would compromise patient safety.  The HSE, together with medical consultant staff at the hospital and midwifery managers, are completely satisfied that the level of midwifery staffing currently available is sufficient for the safe opening of 128 of the 144 beds.  The HSE has been in regular contact with midwives in the course of the week.  It is encouraging that more than 300 midwives have attended orientation  programmes at the new hospital during the week.  The HSE has set a new date of Saturday next for the opening of the hospital.  I sincerely hope that common sense will prevail in ensuring the facility is opened next Saturday.In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, my Department has been informed by the HSE that the number of women in the Louth-Meath region presenting for assessment during pregnancy has increased significantly in recent years.  The projected figure for 2007 is more than 4,500, an increase of more than 100% since 2000 when approximately 2,100 women presented at the hospital.  The HSE acknowledges this has placed additional pressure on services and has resulted in women having to wait longer than planned for assessment by a consultant obstetrician.  My Department is advised that the HSE has recently approved 22 new midwife posts, two specialist nurse posts and three new consultant anaesthetist posts to relieve the current pressures.  That will be closely monitored in the maternity unit at the hospital relative to demand.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I also wish all the best for a resolution at Cork University Maternity Hospital.  People were astonished to learn that this magnificent hospital could not open due to industrial relations difficulties.  Does the Minister have concerns regarding poor management at HSE level?  She might investigate why a major brand new hospital remained closed due to issues that would have been resolved well before the new project's opening in any well-managed organisation.  Will she investigate to establish the exact difficulty to ensure best practice within the HSE?The Minister should respond to the fact that an expert group, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, produced a report on maternity hospitals last October that alerted her to serious staffing problems therein.  The report produced last October made it clear that the basic infrastructure of maternity services is grossly inadequate and staffing problems exist across the board in that regard.  Had the Minister taken action when the report was published, situations such as those affecting Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital probably would not have arisen.I understand the Central Statistics Office brought out its final report today, which shows a highly significant increase in population.  Although I cannot recall the exact figure, there has been an increase of approximately 400,000.  This will affect metropolitan areas such as Cork and Dublin, as well as the regions surrounding them.  No preparatory work has been done by the Minister, her Department or the HSE to meet this need, which explains the stresses and strains in Cork, as well as the spectacle of pregnant women waiting for five months before receiving full ante-natal care.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I am not familiar with the CSO figures that were released today as, in common with the Deputy, I have been very busy.  However, the population is undoubtedly increasing in the eastern region in particular, which puts pressure on the system.  I understand the number of births in County Louth has doubled in a six-year period, which constitutes a considerable increase.As for Cork University Maternity Hospital, while efforts were made at local level to resolve the issue, eventually it ended up going through all the State's industrial relations machinery.  The Labour Court recommended that it should open and staffing levels were recommended and have been agreed.  The ratio of midwives to births in the Cork hospital will be 1:23, while the equivalent ratio in the National Maternity Hospital is 1:32.  The director of midwifery and the obstetricians there have stated that it was safe.  While I do not wish to say anything that might inflame the situation, I hope the difficulty can be resolved and that the hospital can be opened next Saturday.  One of the issues to be addressed is the speed at which the required additional staff can be recruited.The report from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in respect of nationwide maternity services has many good features.  I have read the report, which suggests that all existing maternity units should be retained.  This came as a surprise because previous advice from obstetricians did not seem to take that view.  In recent years, insurance issues and other factors led to the closure of maternity units in locations such as Dundalk, based on patient safety and best practice.It is clear that the number of consultants, including obstetricians, in the health care system must be greatly increased.  Undoubtedly, their number must be doubled.  Other staff are also required, which is why a new contract with consultants is particularly important in order that recruitment may take place.  While I am aware it does not affect the recruitment of nurses and midwives, it certainly affects the recruitment of doctors and substantially more must be recruited in both anaesthetics and obstetrics.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I am committed to ensuring the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million for this year to meet the additional costs involved and I have approved an additional 69 posts for the roll-out.  BreastCheck appointed the clinical directors for the south and west last November and has recently appointed three consultant radiologists, two consultant surgeons and two consultant histopathologists, all of whom have a special interest in breast disease.  The recruitment of radiographers and other staff is under way.I have also made available an additional €26.7 million in capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of five additional mobile units and state-of-the-art digital equipment.  The static units at the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, Cork and University College Hospital, Galway are on schedule for hand-over in September, followed by a three-week commissioning period and will be operational in October.Screening in individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck's management and operational considerations.  In advance of the commissioning of the static unit in the south, BreastCheck is making every effort to achieve earlier roll-out through the use of a mobile unit.  Early deployment of a mobile unit in advance of the completion of the regional screening unit gives rise to particular and unique operational and recruitment challenges for BreastCheck in the south.  At present, these challenges have not been overcome and as a result it is not possible to indicate when an early mobile unit will be deployed.  BreastCheck will continue to make every effort to achieve early deployment in the south.As regards the west, about which Deputy Michael D. Higgins asked, the roll-out is to commence in April.

Women in the west, south and north west had understood that universal screening would be available by the end of 2007.

However, the Minister's reply indicates that light at the end of the tunnel will not even be seen this year.  This is disturbing and concerns me because breast cancer screening saves lives.  Improvements have been discerned in Northern Ireland where such screening is available to all who need it.Regrettably however, Members are also aware that the cancer plan is in something of a shambles and that services such as radiotherapy that should be in place are in a quagmire.  They have been removed from the public private partnership process that was supposed to be the method for providing cancer services and are now in a different system.  The present scenario is a sorry affair.  Is the Minister stating that Members can no longer expect the complete roll-out of BreastCheck in 2007 and that gaps will continue thereafter?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	651	The cancer plan is not in a shambles and the radiotherapy plan has not been removed from the public private partnership process.  The construction stage will be carried out in the traditional manner and the linear accelerator element will be carried out through the public private partnership.  This is because the money has been allocated in the capital plan, which was done for reasons of speed to meet the timeframe of 2011.As for the roll-out, the buildings will be handed over in September and commissioned three weeks later, which suggests a date in late September or October.  I am uncertain when in September the hand-over will take place.  That has always been the date and I have never given another.  However, to advance screening, approval was given for mobile units.  A mobile unit will begin work in the west in April.  A staffing issue has arisen with regard to the mobile unit in the south.  It is more difficult to obtain key staff for mobile units because they are farther away from base and it is still a challenge.  Recently, I had a meeting with BreastCheck on this matter.  If memory serves me correctly, once the roll-out begins in a region, which will be April in this case, it takes approximately two years to roll it out to the entire population of the region.  This was the timeframe in Dublin and other areas for full roll-out.

The Minister acknowledges that due to fact the Government has not really put its back behind this, the first women screened under BreastCheck on the east coast will possibly have their third screening before the programme is implemented in the west of Ireland.  This is truly dramatic when we see the cancer report published during the week which shows BreastCheck identifies breast cancer at an earlier stage, the disease is less advanced, the trauma is reduced and the possibility of survival is dramatically improved because of it.  These opportunities will be missed in the west.

Above all else, it must be done on a quality assured basis and the multidisciplinary approach works extraordinarily well.  I discussed population screening programmes with other countries.  I know of no country which was able to do it quickly.  I do not state it took seven years.  I cannot state that and put my hand on my heart.  It takes quite some time from when the policy is approved to the time the population covered by the screening is contacted and screened and receiving follow-up attention.

I presume the process has moved forward.  Will the Minister clarify the extent of recruitment as against the identified need?  The Minister gave figures on radiologists and others who were pinpointed and who, I presume, signed the dotted line to take up various areas of responsibility.  Will the Minister state how short of the expected requirement in terms of staffing cover will the roll-out be as the year progresses?  What deficiencies exist?Will we find a situation like that of the previous question on the situation in Cork University Maternity Hospital whereby in the immediate run-in to the expected official opening we will find deficiencies in staffing numbers?  Will the Minister comment on the remarks made last evening in the associate House in this institution by a Senator from the west of Ireland who is anything but satisfied at the roll-out in the west and expressed grave concerns with regard to whether BreastCheck availability in Galway will be up and running by October or November?  The Minister indicated the clinical screening unit will be in situ at University College Hospital, Galway and will be the identified area for the west.  How soon after that will the mobile units physically get about their work?

It has been a long day.It is the same in the south where the static unit will be available in September and commissioned three weeks later.  An issue is raised with regard to the mobile unit for the south with regard to recruiting manager radiographers.  The process is aggressively under way by BreastCheck but it has not yet succeeded.  I had a meeting with BreastCheck during the past month and it faces challenges in the south with regard to this matter.  The consultant staffing complement was recruited and is not an issue.

The two reports addressed the VHI's status.  I am in the process of studying the recommendations made in the two reports, including those relating to the VHI.  I am also awaiting a report from the market review group which is expected at the end of this month.  When I have had the opportunity to examine all of the recommendations I intend to bring forward proposals to Government.  Those recommendations will also inform the legislation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	665	We now come to private notice questions to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government regarding the quality of water in County Galway.  I will call on the Deputies who tabled questions to the Minister in the order in which they were submitted to the office of the Ceann Comhairle.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I propose to take all of the questions together.I thank the Deputies for raising this issue which is of extraordinary importance.  As we are at this advanced stage in our development as a nation, it is simply not acceptable that 90,000 people in Galway are in the position they are in.  Drinking water in modern societies is provided through a complex production process.  It is fundamental to this process that pollution and health risks to consumers are monitored, systematically measured and dealt with through proper treatment.  To ensure the rigour and uniformity of standards in this matter, drinking water quality requirements are prescribed in both EU and national legislation.  In Ireland monitoring of these standards is carried out at primary level by local authorities.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, recently commented on the performance of local authorities in that regard.  This primary monitoring is carried out in co-operation with the Health Service Executive.  In turn, local authority performance is monitored and reported on by the EPA.The risk to water consumers from cryptosporidium is well recognised and there is much literature on the issue internationally.  In November 2004 the National Disease Surveillance Centre also published a report on waterborne cryptosporidiosis.  This was circulated to all local authorities by the EPA with the request that they update their risk assessments based on the revised methodology of the report.  To be fair to local authorities, this has been done, with nearly 400 risk assessments carried out in response to the EPA's request.My Department has also produced very detailed guidelines for local authorities on minimising the risk of cryptosporidium in water supplies.  The guidelines were prepared in consultation with the Department of Health and Children and the EPA, with the express purpose of providing clear advice to assist local authorities in preventing cryptosporidium getting into water supply systems and infecting consumers.  They cover all aspects of water supply management, including source protection, monitoring, treatment processes, storage and distribution.Galway city and county issued a boil water notice on 15 March, on the advice of the HSE, in response to people becoming ill as a result of suspected cryptosporidiosis.  Since then, the three agencies have worked closely to deal with the issue and established an incident response team made up of environmental and water services professionals.The presence of cryptosporidium in Galway County Council's Headford water scheme was confirmed on Tuesday, 20 March and in the city council's old Terryland plant which is part of the Galway city water supply scheme on Wednesday, 21 March.  I understand no indication of cryptosporidium has been found in the council's second and more modern treatment plant, also in Terryland.  Fortunately, cryptosporidium at the old Terryland plant has decreased to well below critical risk levels, although understandably the boiled water notice still remains in place and will remain until the issue is dealt with.Inadequate filtration capacity at the old treatment plant in Terryland is at the centre of the problem with the Galway city supply.  Funding has been in place for some time under my Department's water services investment programme.  The funding, available for almost five years, amounts to €21.5 million and is intended to upgrade the plant which will minimise future risk of contamination of the supply.  I understand the city council will be submitting a brief for the appointment of consultants to prepare a preliminary report for the scheme to my Department "as soon as possible."  It cannot be soon enough and the brief will receive immediate attention when it arrives.The Headford water supply scheme is a small stand-alone one using raw water from Lough Corrib with a disinfection process only.  A €29 million extension of the Tuam regional water supply scheme to Headford which is also being funded under my Department's water services investment programme is under construction and commissioning is expected to take place next August.  In the meantime, I understand Galway County Council has secured an alternative supply that could be in place within a week or so, from the Caherlistrane-Kilcoona group water scheme which has had a new €4 million treatment plant installed last month.  This is good news and, again, the funding came from the rural water programme.At this point I want to specifically refute any suggestion the current problem in Galway has to do with failure on the part of my Department.  It is time we stopped acting the fool and looking for explanations when local authorities, or any public authority, do not deliver.  I have clarified that funding of €21.5 million has been available for some time for the Terryland upgrade and that formal proposals are still, five years later, awaited by the Department.  Work on the extension of the Tuam regional scheme is being funded, as I mentioned, to the tune of €29 million under the scheme and is nearing completion.  The interim supply for Headford from the Caherlistrane-Kilcoona group water scheme has also been made possible by the provision of departmental funding.On a national level, unprecedented investment is being made by my Department in new and improved water supply schemes, with those potentially at risk from cryptosporidium a particular priority.  The fruit of this investment is borne out by the EPA whose latest report verifies the fundamentally high quality of Ireland's drinking water in general.  I fully appreciate that this does not allay the real distress of the people and businesses affected in Galway by this extremely unsatisfactory position but it is also the case that this is an exceptional incident.I have had private discussions with Deputies in the House, particularly those local to the problem, including Deputy Michael Higgins.  I intend to travel to Galway tomorrow and will bring with me senior personnel from my Department.  I intend to ask for an explanation of why there has not been more urgency and ambition in delivering the water scheme.On the specific recruitment issue, I assure Deputy Sargent it has nothing to do with this problem.  It has been indicated——

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	675	I intend to travel to Galway tomorrow with senior personnel from my Department.  The objective will be to ask why we have not seen progress on the scheme to date.  We will also put in place measures to provide the interim supply which is apparently available and to ensure this happens in the shortest possible time.  We will request the council to sit down and get through the basic provisions which are required by this House for the handling of public contracts and deliver a normal water supply for the people of Galway sooner rather than later.

Tá tábhacht ag baint le truailliú an scéim uisce i gContae na Gaillimhe agus tá ceisteanna le freagairt maidir leis.  Tá sé níos tábhachtaí fós iad a chur chuige chun leigheas a fháil ar an scéal chomh sciopaí agus is féidir.  I will list a number of questions.  It is important that the people of Galway, following the Minister's visit tomorrow, receive clear answers.  For a start, it is unsatisfactory that officials of Galway City Council would not attend a meeting attended by the vast majority of councillors.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	677	Hear, hear.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	678	There is a considerable problem with trust and information on when, for example, this problem was first discovered.Taking into account the 2004 guidelines and the study distributed, the State accepts responsibility for the provision of clean drinking water.  Responsibility for management and compliance is divested to local authorities.  Will the Minister tomorrow ensure the city council puts into the public realm the number of tests carried out to date and the dates and frequency of these tests in order that people will know how this problem arose.  They may, in turn, be able to plan for avoidance of a similar problem in the future.There is a reasonable doubt that the cause of the lethargy in applying for funding might have been the Water Services Bill which is stuck on Report Stage.  The city council may have been anticipating privatisation or a public private partnership to manage water and wastewater services.  The Minister might agree that if we were dealing with a privately managed water or wastewater service, we would be dealing with a nightmare with no accountability.  It is important that people be reassured in the short term and that interim measures be taken.The Minister answered one of my questions, but if the €21.5 million was allocated five years ago, when was it communicated to Galway City Council?  Is the water infrastructure investment programme document required under law to be placed before the council's elected members for discussion and so forth?  How did the delay come to be and did it have something to do with understaffing in the local authorities?  In responding in the short and medium terms and in enabling all three phases of the capital programme response to be implemented in the interests of the people, will the Minister release permission tomorrow if additional staff are needed?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I thank the Deputy.  I have contacted him, Deputy Grealish and other local representatives.Deputy Michael D. Higgins knows the water services investment programme is a public document and is notified to all local authorities.  The idea suggested during the course of the day that the local council was not aware that €21 million was available to it is patent nonsense.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	681	Not only is it a public document communicated to the council, but the announcements about County Galway were well covered in the excellent journal, The Connacht Tribune.  I ask Deputy Higgins to forgive me, as I do not have specific notes on the matter, but one can find a full-page report on the matter dated 19 May 2002, possibly on page 2 or 3.  However, that is not the issue.  We can start to examine how the breakdown occurred after the event has been resolved, as it is more important to put all of our energy into solving the problem.I have had discussions with all of the Deputies from the area.  Not only is this issue critical to the affected families, but——

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	683	——it is a potential disaster for Galway city and I want to see it overcome.  We can either spend our energies fighting one another or solving problems.My trip to Galway tomorrow, at some inconvenience, arises because I want to spend time bringing together people from the Department, the county and city councils and the health authority and anyone else who is necessary to resolve the problem.  There are solutions and our energy should go towards resolving the problem rather than being wasted in examining its history.I agree with Deputy Michael Higgins that intermediate measures must be taken if there is to be an increase in public confidence.  Obviously, the original Terryland plant must be taken out of commission.  As the Deputy knows, the plant has filter beds and, if one watched the "Six One News", one would see the plant would not be an advertisement for how our country should be in 2007.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	685	That matter is a canard introduced to deflect attention from the fact there has been no progress.  It is not an issue.  Major programmes put a strain on local authority staff, but the House is continuously advised that we must keep public service numbers in control.  To give credit to the local government sector, it has kept control of those numbers.  Where the staffing issue arises in respect of a specific project, it is possible to incorporate the project team in the overall capital issue.I do not understand why the scheme has not progressed and I would be angry were I a councillor.  I will ask that question tomorrow, but it will be the least of my questions.  I will be concerned with how to resolve the problem in weeks rather than months.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	687	It is good to know the Minister will go to Galway tomorrow, as it is important that progress be made by the visit.  Will the Minister clarify what he meant when he stated that money was in place?  Is it in place in the Custom House and the Minister is waiting to release it?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	688	That is correct.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	689	It is not in the Galway coffers.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	690	May I respond?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	691	I want to clarify what the Minister meant and I understand he must release the money.  However, my statement was true.  We can argue why it is true or what the situation should be, but is the fact that Galway City Council has the lowest local authority staffing level per capita not an alarm bell?  Perhaps it is not related to the water problem.  In light of developments in Galway, this issue must be addressed to avoid another problem that must be dealt with in a fire brigade approach.Given the Minister has focused on where he believes the fault to be, namely, in the west rather than the east in the Custom House and that we are in the twilight of this Dáil, does the Water Services Bill 2003 not need to be enacted quickly?  It would provide an inspectorate with greater power, provide for the regulation of water group schemes and prevent a recurrence of what we are witnessing.  In as much as the Minister can promise to implement the Bill, given that it should already be enacted, he should take the idea with him to Galway.Does the Minister accept that a message must go to some of his colleagues on the council who have been quick to develop the built environment in the Galway area at a rate of knots?  Water capacity in Galway is at 100%.  Tomorrow, will the Minister give his colleagues the message that if we are to prevent further strain on the overstrained system, we must upgrade the water supply before more development takes place?We all want to be constructive about this.  On the eve of an election, it is tempting to start kicking political footballs around and I hope the Minister will resist that temptation, as I will try to resist it due to the limited time available.  My colleague, Galway's mayor, Niall Ó Brolcháin, has tabled a five-point plan on the priority of providing fresh water through filters, finding the human source — Oughterard and Claregalway are still discharging raw sewage into Lough Corrib — a temporary engineering solution in terms of ozone treatment, putting in place a modern regional treatment plant and consolidating the agencies.  The Minister mentioned three agencies, but I understand we are dealing with approximately nine agencies, such as the fisheries boards, the EPA, the Department, the HSE and the local authorities.  Perhaps tomorrow's visit will provide a consolidated framework through which to address water quality needs.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	692	I thank the Deputy for his comments.  He asked whether money is in place.  Money has been earmarked for this scheme.  As every Deputy in the House knows, this process does not involve sending a cheque to a local authority, it involves telling the authority that it can draw down a certain amount of money after it has finalised the relevant scheme.  That is how moneys are made available.  Money is available to the scheme in question in the same way as it was available to the 399 schemes throughout the country which are being progressed, including those in Sligo, Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Bray.  I do not want to get involved in the blame game because it will not help to solve the problem in Galway.  Other local authorities have drawn down the funds they have needed.  I will speak tomorrow about how the local authority in this instance can draw down the money that is needed to get this scheme under way.I did not mean to interrupt Deputy Sargent in any way when he was arguing that Galway City Council needs more staff.  I assured the local authorities late last year that a mechanism was available to them if they had issues relating to staffing.  I refer to the method of capitalising staff, in effect, for the building of particular schemes.  I will talk to the authorities in Galway about that tomorrow.  I do not want to mislead the House in any way by suggesting that I intend to lift the recruitment embargo or the cap on staffing levels, which are in place for good reasons.  We are all familiar with the excessive staffing levels in some sectors of the public service.  We are not getting value for money in such areas.I agree with the point Deputy Sargent made about the Water Services Bill 2003.  This important legislation has been around for a long time.  As the Deputy knows, it has been the subject of lengthy discussions in this House.  I will push the Bill over the hurdle and get it through with the co-operation of the Deputy, his party and the other parties.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	693	We are willing to co-operate to that end.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I am grateful to the Deputy for that undertaking.  I accept that the spokespersons of the Opposition parties have encountered certain difficulties.  Some committee meetings could not be held at times when I would have liked them to be held.  I am not pointing the finger in any way in that regard as all the Members of this House are very busy.  I agree with Deputy Sargent that the Water Services Bill 2003 is fundamental legislation.  If we do nothing else between now and the date of the general election, we should put that legislation in place and we can do so.  I am willing to work with all Deputies in this House to that end.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	695	Will the Minister, who is responsible for making the final decision in that respect, talk to the Chief Whip?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	696	The Bill in question is one of those I designated as priority legislation.  With this exception, all the Bills on my priority list have been enacted with the assistance of the Members of the House.  The Houses completed their consideration of the Carbon Fund Bill 2006 and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2007 this week.  The Water Services Bill 2003 is the last of my priority Bills to be passed by the Oireachtas.  When it has been dealt with, I will be in the happy position of being one of the few Ministers to have competed his or her entire legislative programme during the lifetime of this Dáil.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	697	The Labour Party Whip is asking for the Bill to be brought before the House.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I do not mean to be negative when I point out that it was reported in the media today that a letter containing a five-point plan had been sent to me by the Lord Mayor of Galway.  I wish to make clear that I have not received any such correspondence from him.  I will give it respectful attention when I get it.  I had to visit the Green Party's excellent website before I came to the House to learn what is mentioned in the five-point plan.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I can give the Minister a copy of the plan if he wants it.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	700	I am grateful for that, but it would have been rather nice——
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I am sorry the Minister does not have it yet.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	702	I have seen it now.  It would have been nice to have had an opportunity to receive the document from the Lord Mayor of Galway before he went on television and contacted the other media to say he had sent it to me.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	703	He thought the Minister had received it.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	704	He did not send it to me.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	705	I congratulate the trustees of the Caherlistrane-Kilcoona group water scheme, which is the scheme in my area, for agreeing to provide a water supply to the town of Headford to ensure that its residents have a potable water supply until this problem has been solved.  Is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has referred almost exclusively to Galway city and its environs in his comments this evening, aware that this problem is not confined to those areas?  It is affecting a large section of County Galway, including Headford, Tuam, Corofin and Athenry.  Does the Minister agree that the words he has uttered about this problem have not contributed to reaching an immediate solution?  He has focused on the allocation of the infamous €21.5 million and claimed that Galway City Council has not responded adequately.  His approach has not helped to find the short-term solution that is needed in this instance.  Given that the buck stops with the Minister — he is ultimately responsible because the local authority is under his control — will he provide the leadership that is needed?Does the Minister, Deputy Roche, agree that the pollution of the water supply of a large portion of County Galway represents a serious emergency?  Does he accept that the full weight of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government needs to be brought to bear in these circumstances?  Does he share the view that all available expert opinion needs to be used by local authorities if they are to deal with this problem?  Given that there have been similar outbreaks in Belfast and Milwaukee, will the Minister and the local authorities seek advice from their counterparts in those cities?  Will the Minister look for details of the action that was taken in those cities to get their problems under control?  For example, we need to learn more about the measures that were put in place in Belfast and Milwaukee to prevent a recurrence of such outbreaks.The Minister has criticised Galway County Council by claiming that it has not acted to modernise its water treatment facilities.  Does he wish to make further criticisms of the council, or is he satisfied with its handling of the situation?  Is he satisfied that the council has used the resources provided to it for water schemes and water treatment facilities in an expedient manner?  Is he aware of the cause of the outbreak?  Has the source of the outbreak been identified?  If not, have any possible causes been eliminated as a result of investigations?  Will the Minister explain how the problems being experienced in County Galway, which are like those that exist in Third World countries, have been allowed to develop at a time when we enjoy all the benefits of modern technology?  Are we applying the best technology that is available to us?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	706	I would like to correct the Deputy in one respect, I have not been critical of Galway County Council.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I meant to say that the Minister has criticised Galway City Council, rather than Galway County Council.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	708	That is correct.  I was correcting the Deputy because he referred to "Galway County Council".
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	709	I am sorry.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	710	I do not mean to score a point but to ensure that the Deputy's comments are factual.  I will not be critical of Galway City Council until I travel to Galway tomorrow to see why it did not take action.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	711	The Minister was critical of Galway City Council last night.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	712	We do not need to quibble about that.  We do not have to go to Milwaukee, Sydney, Northern Ireland, Britain or any other part of the world to find examples of problems of this nature.  There have been major problems in this country — Ennis is a case in point.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	713	We have had 400 cases, including some in the midlands.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	714	There are problems in County Kildare and, famously, in Mullingar, and solutions  were found to many of these problems within a short time.  That is one of the issues that will arise, and in respect of which I will seek an explanation, when I travel to Galway tomorrow.  I disagree with Deputy McHugh's first point in so far as I believe that those in office are responsible for telling people the truth.  If it is a fact that money was available but was not drawn down, the people have a right to know.  There may have been debates in Galway City Council about why the money was not drawn down.  I do not know and I have not inquired.  If such debates have not taken place at council level, where stewardship in this matter lies, we need to ask why not.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	715	The Minister is talking about the city, but this problem is widespread in the county.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I will deal with that specific point.  There is concern about the boiling water notice that has been posted in respect of the Tuam scheme, with which Deputy McHugh is familiar.  The notice has been posted even though cryptosporidium has not been identified in the samples that have been taken.  It has been posted with the precautionary principle specifically in mind.  It was decided that it made sense to take such a precaution in case water was being drawn from a scheme in a similar position.The Deputy asked whether all available expertise will be brought to bear.  When I travel to Galway tomorrow, I will be accompanied by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's top experts in this area, as well as the assistant secretary who is responsible for the financial side of the Department.  We will find out how we can help the authorities in Galway to overcome the difficulties being experienced in the area.  We will examine the interim solutions.  Galway City Council, which was mentioned by Deputy McHugh, will have to be part of the solution.  We will have to find an alternative supply somewhere in the Galway County Council area to be diverted to the Terryland plant.  As Deputy McHugh knows, such a supply cannot be found within the municipal area.  The various authorities in the Galway area will have to make a joint effort to reach a solution to this problem.  I assure the Deputy that the available expertise will be brought to bear.I have corrected the Deputy's slip of the tongue, when he suggested that I had criticised Galway County Council.  I am prepared to come to the House next week to outline the exact solutions which are to be put in place.  We should put our collective energy towards resolving this.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins, Deputy Grealish and others who live in Galway have conveyed a real sense of concern about the upcoming season.  Deputy Grealish provided me with information about bookings for the Easter period being cancelled.  We cannot allow that to continue and we must focus on the solution.  When the solutions are in place, we can learn the lessons.  I am not critical of a particular local authority but it is unacceptable that funding provided by the taxpayer is not drawn down.Since I took over this portfolio I have issued instructions to clear the bureaucratic hurdles and red tape that existed.  I have given clearance for schemes under €5 million after one visit to my Department.  The local authorities then have responsibility to deliver.  They cannot be expected to allocate limited staff resources to filling in forms.In the case of the larger schemes I have truncated the number of necessary steps.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	717	This is a larger scheme.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	718	I hope it works and I hope that someone does not tell me in the future that I released funds that were not properly stewarded.I am a firm believer in local government.  I disagree with Deputy McHugh in that I believe local government has very limited powers and responsibilities in Ireland.  It should exercise them in full and not seek to pass the buck.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The Water Services Bill is not scheduled for next week.  The Minister should return with that Bill next week.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	720	Deputy McCormack cannot be present and I will ask supplementary questions on his behalf.  Has a preliminary design been completed in respect of the augmentation of water treatment plants?  Has this been sought by the Department or the relevant local authority?Has any work been done on identifying the source of this problem?  Technology is readily available and applicable in cases of this nature.  In view of the serious health threat posed by contamination of the water supply, have tests been carried out?  It could affect another area next week.  Local authority officials generally know possible sources of such contamination and can proceed to the source.  They can apply dyes to the water.  Has this been done or will it be done?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	721	Before coming into the Chamber I heard the director of services state that full source testing is taking place.  In this problem area it is difficult to trace the infection.  This is the critical time of the year because the lambing season is closely associated with it.  Faecal contamination and afterbirths contribute to it and this causes the contaminant to enter the system.

Our cancer survival rate does not compare favourably with many countries in the EU 15.  Cancer survival rates are linked to European geography but we learned that this is also the case on a national basis.  This makes grim reading for the Minister but does not come as a surprise.  Two years ago, a report compared cancer survival rates in Northern Ireland with the Republic.  The figures showed that, for breast cancer in particular, a greater percentage of women died in the Republic than in Northern Ireland.  This week we learn that women in four different regions, the midlands, the south east, the south west and the west, have a higher risk of death from breast cancer than in other regions.Irish women have poorer survival rates from breast cancer than many of our sisters in Europe and Northern Ireland.  Women in four regions, including the midlands and the west, have significantly higher rates of death than our sisters in other regions.  This is a stark statistic.  These are not minor variations.  The risk of death from breast cancer is 28% higher if one lives in the midlands and 26% higher in the west.  The poorer survival rates also apply to colorectal and prostate cancer.The Taoiseach accepted the fact of significant regional variations in survival from those suffering from a number of cancers.  As always, the Government states that matters are improving and will get better.  There may be truth in this.  Who takes responsibility for the failure of the past ten years?  Who takes responsibility for the fact that BreastCheck is not available in the north west?  Who takes responsibility for the fact that we are 40 years behind our European counterparts because we have no cervical screening programme?  Who takes responsibility for the deficit of 18 urologists to treat prostate cancer in Ireland?Who takes responsibility for the fact that, as the second richest country in Europe, people in the north west do not have reasonable access to a radiotherapy service?  There is no promise of a service other than that in Belfast which can barely cope with demand in Northern Ireland.  It has committed to take one patient per month.  Is that good enough for those living in the north west?Who takes responsibility for those who need palliative therapy in the north west?  This will give them some quality of life as the illness progresses.  They are too sick to travel long distances on inadequate public transport.  Will anyone take responsibility for the poorer access to chemotherapy and radiotherapy in many regions?  This leads to poorer chances of survival.  Will the Government state that things are getting better?  That is not good enough and does not represent being accountable in the way Ministers and the Government should be.  Responsibility lies squarely on the shoulders of one Minister for Health and Children after another.Will the Minister examine regional services in the context of best practice?  Bigger is good, certainly, but it is not always better.  Will the Minister ensure multidisciplinary teams are in place and that hospital networks share data with satellite units so that those who live in the regions, especially the west and north west, can have reasonable access to the very best services?  This model is in place in a number of countries and it works well.  I am asking that whatever new regime the Minister is putting in place, she will guarantee better service, better medical outcomes and geographical access for those in the regions.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	728	I am taking the Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The Government welcomes the report on patterns of care and survival of cancer patients in Ireland between 1994 and 2001 which was published this week.  This report, funded by the Department of Health and Children, adds significantly to our understanding of survival patterns of care for four major causes of cancer, namely, breast, colorectal, lung and prostate.  This Government is making the full range of cancer services available to cancer patients throughout the country.  Since 1997, approximately €1 billion has been invested in cancer services nationally.  More than 100 additional consultants have been appointed in key areas of care such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care and histopathology.  An additional 343 clinical nurse specialists have been appointed in the cancer services area.  Almost 94,000 patients were discharged from hospital following a diagnosis of cancer in 2005, an increase of 70% over 1997.We have invested substantially in all regions to improve cancer survival.  The improvements are evidenced in the report.  It shows improvements nationally in survival rates for breast, colorectal and prostate cancers, but not lung cancers.  There were improvements in all regions for breast and prostate cancers and in most areas for colorectal and lung cancers.  For example, in the period 1994 to 1997, 73% of women with breast cancer survived at least five years.  This figure had increased to more than 78% in the period 1998 to 2001.  For colorectal cancer, the five-year survival rate for the period 1998 to 2001 in the north west increased to 53.5%, which is in excess of the national average of 51%.We know there are regional variations in cancer survival rates, and Deputy Harkin has outlined some of those.  The Government's national cancer control strategy, published last year and welcomed by stakeholders, is designed to change this fundamentally to improve outcomes for cancer patients in each region of the country.  We are committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the strategy.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 includes major investment in the cancer area.  We have made available an additional €20.5 million this year for cancer control, covering screening, acute services and research.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5 million to support the initial implementation of the HSE's national cancer control programme.The registry report confirms the importance of a national approach to improvements in cancer control.  It is the intention of the Minister and the HSE to ensure patients, regardless of location, have timely access to high quality, specialised care that will lead to further improvements in cancer mortality rates.  The HSE cancer control programme will manage, organise and deliver quality assured cancer services on a whole population basis, regardless of geography.  The service plan for the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the programme.Evidence-based population screening programmes are an essential element of the strategy.  On 1 January this year, the Minister established a National Cancer Screening Service Board.  This amalgamated BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme, ICSP.  Both BreastCheck and the ICSP will be rolled out nationally this year.  The total allocation to the new service is €33 million, a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the programmes.  The service will also advise on the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme.  The findings contained in the registry report provide an essential benchmark against which we can monitor the provision of equitable cancer services.  The Government is committed to continuing investment in cancer care.  We will ensure that the full range of cancer services is available and accessible to cancer patients in all regions.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	729	I raise the issue of a social welfare case that appears blatantly unfair, discriminatory and anomalous concerning the pension entitlements of a woman in my constituency who is 66 years of age.  This woman lives in west County Waterford, has virtually no vision in her right eye and very little in her left.  Since 1999, she has been in receipt of widow's pension and was further granted the blind pension in 2000.  However, since turning 66. last November and consequently receiving old age contributory pension, she has found that she has lost a considerable amount of her income.Before reaching 66, the two pensions combined had given her €340.10 per week, with fuel and living alone allowances in addition.  However, on turning 66 she lost the entitlement to the blind pension and now receives only €209.30 in basic pension plus fuel and living alone allowances.  As one may imagine, she is quite distressed about this.  She believes it is very unfair to take away one of her social welfare payments simply because she has turned 66.  As a result of this development, she has become quite depressed and feels a large amount of her independence has been taken away from her.She has written a number of letters to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, about her case, to no avail.  In each instance she has pointed out the contrast with those receiving carer's allowance.  They will be able to claim half a carer's allowance as well as another social welfare payment from September.  Why should people with visual impairment not be treated in the same way?  It is disgraceful that Celtic tiger Ireland treats older people in such a miserly and skinflint manner.  This woman has done nothing wrong.  All that has happened to her is that she has aged one more year, yet she finds herself significantly penalised financially for doing so.  I am calling on the Minister to explain why this anomaly is allowed to exist, whether he agrees with it and if not, how he intends to clear it up.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	730	I am taking this issue on behalf of  the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan.  The social welfare code provides for the avoidance of multiple payments.  That is, where a person is entitled to more than one income maintenance payment at any time, only one such payment can be made.  However, there are a number of exceptions to this principle provided for in regulations, including the payment of blind pension for persons who have sufficient PRSI contributions concurrent with any of the short-term social insurance payments, including illness, occupational injuries, job seeker's, maternity, adoptive, health and safety benefits or, alternatively, one-parent family and analogous payments or widow's-widower's under 66 contributory or non-contributory payments, all of which relate to working age.  Once a person reaches the age of 66 years, only one payment can be made.The qualifying criteria for entitlement to blind pension states that a person must be over 18 years of age, satisfy a means test and be so blind that he or she cannot perform any work for which eyesight is essential or cannot continue his or her ordinary occupation.  It has always been regarded as a scheme providing income maintenance for persons of working age, that is, up to 66 years.  Prior to the introduction of the State non-contributory pension, a person receiving blind pension who reached 66 years was allowed to continue on it instead of being transferred to the old age non-contributory pension.  This was because the structures of the former old age non-contributory pension and blind pension payments were similar with only marginal differences in terms of the means assessments.  This approach was changed with the introduction of the State non-contributory pension as part of a move towards the rationalisation of social assistance payments, with as far as possible one more favourable means test for all recipients aged 66 years or over, including blind persons over that age.In February 2006, the Government decided that income support and maintenance schemes, together with associated resources, should be transferred from the Health Service Executive to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  An interdepartmental implementation group was established, under the chairmanship of the Department of Health and Children, with representation from the Department for Social and Family Affairs and the HSE, to progress this issue.  The blind welfare allowance is one scheme administered by the HSE which will transfer to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.Blind welfare allowance is a supplementary payment in addition to an existing social welfare payment which is paid to eligible persons over 16 years who are blind or visually impaired or to eligible persons whose income is below the combined rate of blind pension and blind welfare allowance rate.  A person in receipt of blind pension and who qualifies for blind welfare allowance will continue their entitlement past 66 years.A policy review of blind welfare allowance and the other HSE schemes designated for transfer is being conducted.  It is expected the social welfare Bill 2008 will provide the necessary legislative framework for the transfer.  This policy review will examine the scope for rationalisation of the HSE schemes within existing social welfare schemes and the scope for development of these schemes in the context of progressing issues around the additional costs of disability.  Any changes to the blind pension will be considered within the wider context of this policy review and of the transfer of the blind welfare allowance scheme from the HSE to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	731	The Minister of State will have some experience of the lack of residents-only parking in the vicinity of Croke Park.  It is an issue of concern to the local residents who suffer on big event days.  Croke Park's capacity stands at 82,500 and it is open not just to Gaelic games but to international rugby and football matches.  Last night, Croke Park was at full capacity for an international floodlit football game.  Cleaning did not take place until 3 a.m., causing much grief to residents in the vicinity of the facility.  While there has been a large increase in the use of Croke Park, mainly for international games, nothing has been done to make life easier for the residents in the vicinity.Initially when the plans for the expansion of Croke Park were put in place in 1994, it was intended that a one-mile radius around Croke Park would be free from vehicles of fans attending games.  That has not transpired and local residents experience vehicles parked on grass margins, blocking driveways and double yellow lines.  It is especially difficult in the Dublin Central constituency.  Many teams in the latter stages of the all-Ireland championships are from Northern Ireland.  Many fans travel from counties Derry, Donegal, Armagh, Tyrone and the central Dublin area near the Drumcondra Road has seen a proliferation of parking that gives rise to numerous problems for local residents.Since I tabled this matter, I am glad the Minister for Transport has taken on board my proposal.  He has tabled an amendment to the Roads Bill 2007 which is seven pages long and comprises a third of the entire Bill.  It does not, however, address all the issues.  What provision will be made for park-and-ride facilities?  How will the proposed permit system be implemented?  By-laws will be granted to local authorities but will require individual applications when residents-only parking is required.  This will be a nuisance when a generic approach is much preferable.  I am glad a move has been made in the right direction.  It seems there will, however, be teething problems in getting the system right.  When that happens, it will be to the benefit of many people living on the north side of Dublin.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I am replying to this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport.Under the Road Traffic Act 1994 responsibility for traffic management was devolved to individual road authorities.  Responsibility for the implementation of traffic management measures and the application of road traffic regulatory provisions in the Dublin city area is therefore a matter that falls to Dublin City Council  in the first instance.The issue of parking has been the focus of the traffic management issues that have been raised with the Minister for Transport.  Representations have been made to the Minister about parking problems that arise on the roads in the environs of Croke Park and other stadia on match and other event days when a large influx of motorists from outside the area park on residential roads for the duration of the events.On match and event days, the Garda authorities put in place extensive traffic management plans.  This includes a Garda cordon area for crowd safety controls and to regulate access.  This has been in place for many years in respect of the streets in the immediate vicinity of Croke Park and Lansdowne Road when matches or other major events are held there.  Divisional traffic corps units also patrol the outlying areas prior to and subsequent to any event ensuring the traffic flow is maintained.Vehicle owners who reside within the Garda cordon area may apply for an annual permit to allow that vehicle to enter and exit through the cordon barriers.  The regulation of access and residents permits measures are implemented and administered by the Garda as are other traffic management and parking prohibitions that are applied in the greater stadium area on event dates.The matter being raised now is that parking be reserved on a residents only basis on match and event days to facilitate people living in the Croke Park area. This proposal would effectively prohibit or exclude the public from parking on a public road.  An important point to bear in mind is that road traffic regulations have national application and the issue of reserving parking on public roads to local residents is very complex and is much broader than in the context of match days at Croke Park.Discussions on this issue have also drawn attention to the fact that inconvenience can also be experienced by residents where parking congestion can arise on a daily basis on public roads in residential areas in other circumstances in other parts of Dublin and countrywide.  At some locations throughout the country, parking on residential roads is now taken up on a daily basis, not just on periodic match or event days, by motorists, who use the location to park if working nearby or to use the location as a park and ride facility while they commute onwards by bus or rail to work or walk to work and collect their vehicle later that day on return.Provisions in regard to the regulation of road traffic and parking on public roads are contained in the Road Traffic Acts and in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 to 2005 and supported by road traffic signs.  Responsibility for traffic management, including the implementation of parking controls such as prohibitions and restrictions, was devolved to individual road authorities under the Road Traffic Act 1994.  An examination of this issue was carried out in the Department of the existing road traffic legislative provisions to ascertain if new measures to reserve parking to local residents in any circumstances would be appropriate or feasible.  This examination indicated that there is no existing legislative provision to exclusively reserve parking on a specified public road on specified dates to the persons who reside in premises on that road.The matter was then referred to the Office of the Attorney General for advice to establish whether it would be appropriate or feasible to provide for parking restrictions of this nature on a public road at specified times on specified days to cover matches and other events.  On the basis of the advice received, the Minister has included a comprehensive provision, as Deputy Costello mentioned, in the Roads Bill 2007, which is going through the House, to provide a by-law making power for road authorities for restriction or prohibition of parking at specified events.The Deputy referred to other matters, park and ride facilities and so on.  If the Roads Bill is dealt with in this House next week, he might have another opportunity to tease them out.  I am aware of the problem.  My constituency at one stage extended nearer to Croke Park and to the North Circular Road.  The northerners, to whom the Deputy referred, do not all park in the environs of Dublin Central.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 14 together.This Government is intent on supporting genuine competition in the best interests of health insurance consumers and its development in the private health insurance market. At the same time, consideration has to be given to the stability of the community rated health insurance system, and the safeguards necessary to protect it, including risk equalisation. The ultimate beneficiary of risk equalisation is the insured population, particularly the elderly and the ill, who would otherwise be vulnerable to the effects of risk selection, and could find themselves priced out of being able to afford their insurance at the point in their lives when it was needed most.I have appointed a 3 person market review group to examine whether an adequate rate of return is available to insurers in this market and associated issues as quickly as possible. I asked the Group to report back to me by the end of this month, and following consideration of their report, and the Reports of the Competition Authority and the Health Insurance Authority, I expect to bring proposals to Government. Following this process, I may be bringing forward amendments to the Health Insurance Acts or to the Risk Equalisation Scheme.It is the case that some minor amendments to the present scheme will be submitted to the Oireachtas after the Easter recess for affirmation, having regard to the enactment of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2007.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 32, 40, 42, 57, 63, 64, 78 and 101 together.Tackling Healthcare-Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA is a priority for the Government and for the Health Service Executive.  Recently-published studies show that in Ireland, the overall rate of HCAIs, which includes MRSA, is lower than our UK counterparts.  However, it is generally accepted that MRSA infection rates in the UK and Ireland are higher than our European counterparts.  Excessive antibiotic prescribing is a key cause of these higher rates.The Health Service Executive has recently developed a National Infection Control Action Plan including governance and performance management.  The plan has clear targets for all hospitals, clear hygiene and infection control standards, an improved physical environment, initiatives on reducing antibiotic consumption and education of the public and of health professionals, including the current T.V. and media campaign.  Achieving these targets is a priority for the HSE so that patients can be assured that in the future their chances of contracting an infection will be reduced to the minimum level possible.  To achieve this, there is a corporate commitment throughout the HSE and services generally. Evidence-based guidelines, clear responsibility and accountability and the recognition that the public also has a role to play in preventing HCAIs is vital to achieving improvements.In addition, the HSE is currently appointing a number of new infection control nurses, surveillance scientists and antibiotic pharmacists.  These staff will strengthen specialist support for infection control and facilitate the development of the national surveillance system.I have asked the HSE to set up a national helpline which patients and their families can call to report incidents of poor infection control in our hospitals.  If, for example, patients are unhappy that a member of staff is not disinfecting his or her hands between patients, they or a family member can call the helpline if they do not feel in a position to raise the matter directly with staff in the hospital.  This is not about blaming people, it is about helping all of us, patients, visitors and health care staff, to play our part in improving patient care.I have also instructed the HSE that designated private beds should be used where isolation facilities are required for patients who contract a HCAI or MRSA.In relation to the issue of overcrowding in hospitals, focused efforts under the Winter Initiative scheme have achieved a reduction in the numbers waiting for admission on trolleys in A&E and a reduction in the time those patients spend waiting.  Admission lounges have been put in place in a number of hospitals to ensure that patients are treated with dignity while awaiting admission.  A number of new A&E Departments commissioned in 2005/06 have provision for minor injury clinics, including Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Cork University Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital and St. James's Hospital.  In 2006, over 1,000 additional extended care places were provided through privately contracted arrangements.  In relation to 2007, the HSE has developed proposals to contract a further 450 beds in private nursing homes throughout the country.  There are also proposals for an additional 450 beds within the public system.  Additional home-care packages have been put in place to facilitate discharge from hospital to the patient's own home. It is important that people do not remain in hospital any longer than is medically necessary.MRSA is not a notifiable disease but the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE collects data on MRSA as part of the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.  The European Surveillance system collects data on the first episode of blood stream infection per patient per quarter.  The Irish data from the European surveillance system, which is published on a quarterly basis by the HSE shows that there were 445 cases in 2002, 480 cases in 2003, 553 cases in 2004, 592 cases in 2005 and 435 cases up to the end of the third quarter of 2006.  There are no figures available to date in relation to 2007.It is difficult to identify the number of fatalities attributable to MRSA as many people also have significant co-morbidity factors.In 2006, Ireland participated in the Hospital Infection Society's "Third Prevalence Survey of Health Care Associated Infection" in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  The survey, which included 44 Irish acute adult hospitals, including 8 private hospitals, provides data on the prevalence of health care associated infections (including MRSA).  The overall prevalence of healthcare-associated infection in the UK, excluding Scotland and Ireland is 7.9%.  The figure for England is 8.2%, 6.3% for Wales, 5.5% for Northern Ireland and 4.9% for the Republic of Ireland.  10% of HCAIs were MRSA related in the Republic of Ireland.A primary element of the fight against healthcare-associated infections involves changing practices and procedures and the way in which many health care staff go about their daily work.  Hygiene is a significant issue in our hospitals. It impacts hugely on inspection rates. Hand hygiene is the most important form of hygiene in this regard, but hygiene in general is important.It is unrealistic to try to isolate the overall cost of combating HCAIs.  Indeed, reducing the incidence of these infections will not alone improve patient care but will also generate savings in the cost of service delivery.  Minor capital priorities have been identified and are being addressed (€10m this year and €10m next year) by the National Hospitals Office following the two previous national hygiene audits.  In the medium- to long-term, capital funding will be committed to increase the number of single rooms and isolation facilities in keeping with best international practice in hospital design.While accepting that not all healthcare-associated infections are preventable, I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of infection and to treat them promptly when they occur.  The Department of Health and Children will be monitoring and evaluating the progress being made by the HSE in the management of this issue.

Any fees due to an adviser so engaged are payable by the HSE out of funds at its disposal.It was agreed that one of the roles would be filled immediately by internal re-assignment and a second by secondment.  The remaining three roles were of a consultancy nature and were filled through a public procurement process which involved a preliminary notice and shortlisting of candidates.  Candidates were required to provide specific details, including fees charged.  A contract was agreed for each advisor selected.I understand that all of these advisers are contracted to provide 135 days each per annum but that different annual rates applied to each individual.  Where work is required in excess of the 135 days, a per diem rate applied.  This is capped at 20%, i.e. 27 days per annum.

This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy to build on the improvements we have made in recent years, particularly the improvements in survival in all the major cancers.The HSE, at my Department's request, is conducting a national needs assessment for cancer control which will set out priorities in the medium term.  I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5m to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.  The Service Plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.  This includes the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the Director of the Programme and key medical leaders at network level.

It recommends the provision of two child and adolescent community multidisciplinary mental health teams per 100,000 of the population.In 2006, a sum of €26.2 million was allocated for the development of mental health services in line with ‘A Vision for Change'.  A further sum of €25 million has been allocated in 2007 to continue this development.  A significant amount of this year's funding, €7.95 million, is for the development of child and adolescent mental health services.  This funding will bring about significant improvements in community, hospital-based and early intervention services. Existing multidisciplinary teams will be enhanced and new child and adolescent mental health teams developed.In September 2006, there were 45 child and adolescent mental health teams spread throughout the country.  Additional funding was provided in 2006 and 2007 for the development of an additional 16 teams and the enhancement of existing teams.  The provision of additional teams will reduce waiting times for assessment and treatment.It is important to note that all emergency referrals are seen without delay. However, the HSE is currently examining non-emergency waiting lists to identify and improve the least developed services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	743	The Health Service Executive is currently engaged in a public procurement process in relation to the co-location of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals.  I understand that the competitive dialogue stage of the process has been completed and that the Invitation to Tender will issue in the next few days.  The core requirement of a co-located hospital will be to treat the private patients that are currently receiving treatment in the public hospital. The minimum requirements a co located hospital must provide include:Ability to admit private patients directly from public hospital Emergency Departments, primary care centres and GPs on a 24/7 basis;Capacity to treat all private patients currently catered for in the public hospital;Joint Clinical Governance between the public hospital and the co-located hospital;Performance Management requirements and documented service level agreements;Shared Information and Records Management.Selected bidders must confirm their ability to meet these requirements before progressing to the invitation to tender stage of the procurement process.There will be full adherence to public procurement law and best practice. There will be a rigorous value for money assessment of all proposals. Any transaction will be on a commercial basis and will fully protect the public interest.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	744	It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social care needs can be properly met within a primary care setting. The establishment of new integrated multi-disciplinary Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services and reducing reliance on hospital based services.The HSE received an additional €10m in funding in 2006 to enable the establishment of up to 100 Primary Care Teams. A further €22m is being provided in 2007 to meet the full year costs of the Teams initiated in 2006  and to enable a further 100 Primary Care Teams  to be established.In accordance with the approach set out in the strategy "Primary Care: A New Direction", the composition of Teams will depend on the needs, demographics and  geographic location of the population served but will typically consist of GPs, Nurses, Home Helps and Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and Social Work professionals. A wider range of professionals including Pharmacists, Dieticians, Psychologists and Chiropodists will be organised into Primary Care Networks, with each such Network supporting a number of Primary Care Teams.To date the HSE has identified the location for the first group of teams, which includes some 500 GPs who will be members of teams.  Some 94 new frontline professionals are in post or about to take up posts. The HSE will be working in the current year to involve substantial additional numbers of GPs and to appoint the additional personnel required, with a view to having some 200 Primary Care Teams in place by the end of 2007.The Government has committed under the Towards 2016 agreement to the establishment of 300 Primary Care Teams by 2008; 400 by 2009; and 500 by 2011.  A review of these targets will be undertaken in 2008.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	745	The Leas Cross report was published by the Health Service Executive on the 10th November 2006. The Health Service Executive has confirmed that it fully accepts the recommendations made by Professor O'Neill and has already addressed many of these that apply to the HSE.  My Department and the HSE are working together to implement the report's recommendations.My colleague, the Minister for Health & Children has had discussions with a group representing relatives of patients at Leas Cross Nursing Home. She has indicated that she will ask a Senior Counsel to carry out an inquiry into matters relating to Leas Cross.The Department is currently in discussion with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the drafting of the terms of reference. Officials of the Department will meet with the relatives group shortly to discuss the terms of reference.The Department is also implementing significant changes to give the required assurance to older people about care standards. A thorough and robust system of inspections is vital. The Health Bill 2006 provides for the first time for an independent, statutory body to set standards and inspect all nursing home places, both public and private. This will also strengthen the registration and de-registration process. New draft standards for all long-term residential care facilities for older people have also been prepared and will be the subject of consultation with key stakeholders.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	746	The Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS) provides for a range of dental services for adult medical card holders from participating dentists holding contracts with the Health Service Executive (HSE).The DTSS Review Group was established in May 2006 to undertake a comprehensive review of Primary Care Oral Health Services provided under the DTSS.  Represented on the Review Group are the HSE, the Health Service Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Irish Dental Association (IDA).  The Group is chaired by Mr Finbar Flood.Since the Group was established, a legal issue has arisen with regard to the Competition Act 2002 as it relates to the negotiation of professional fees.  My Department has sought legal advice from the Attorney General in this regard.  In the meantime, the management side has offered to continue discussions on the non-fee element of the review.  The IDA has not accepted this offer.I understand that the IDA are balloting their members on a proposal to withdraw their support from the DTSS.  The existing contractual arrangements with private dental practitioners under the DTSS for the provision of dental services to eligible patients remain in place.

The issue of service planning and provision for stroke victims has been, and continues to be a matter for discussion and examination between my Department and the HSE.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	749	I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 105 together.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services is a matter for the Health Service Executive (HSE) and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall Vote.My Department has been informed by the HSE that the number of women in the Louth/Meath region presenting for assessment during pregnancy has increased significantly in recent years. The projected figure for 2007 is over 4,500, an increase of over 100% since the year 2000 when approximately 2,100 women presented at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. The HSE acknowledges that this has placed additional pressure on services and has resulted in women having to wait longer than planned for assessment by a consultant obstetrician.My Department is advised that the HSE has recently approved  22 new midwife posts, 2 specialist nurse posts and 3 new consultant anaesthetist posts to relieve the current pressures and that it will be closely monitoring staffing levels at the maternity unit at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda relative to demand.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	750	The Government's sustained high level of investment in healthcare under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 enabled the completion and commissioning last year of several new facilities in both the Acute Hospitals and the Primary, Community and Continuing Care sectors.The HSE Capital Plan 2006 contained a wide range of capital projects. A significant proportion of the Executive's capital programme is composed of projects that are multi-annual in nature and were intended to be commenced or progressed through various stages of procurement in 2006.The provisional outturn for 2006 shows that the total capital spending by the HSE in 2006 amounted to just over €450 million.The medium to major capital projects completed to construction stage or commissioned during 2006 included:Acute HospitalsMidland Regional Hospital at TullamoreCork University Hospital — Maternity Unit; Infrastructure UpgradeCork University Hospital —  A&E & DPUUniversity College Hospital GalwayPhase 2St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park — Phase ISt. James's Hospital — A & E ExtensionSt James's Hospital — Phase 1HMater / National Paediatric Hospital — Enabling and decanting worksLimerick Maternity Hospital — ExtensionSligo General Hospital — Renal UnitSouth Tipperary Hospital DevelopmentWexford General Hospital — Ward Extension & RefurbishmentPrimary, Community and Continuing CareBallymun Primary Health Care FacilitySt. John's Community Hospital, Wexford — Phase 1FOLD Accommodation for the Elderly, ClaremontManorhamilton Regional OfficesEnniscrone Primary Health Care FacilityCarrigart Primary Health Care CentreCresslough Primary Health Care CentreMeath Hospital (Older Persons Unit)Cork University Hospital — Orthodontic UnitHospital of the Assumption, Thurles (Older People)Thurles Community Hospital

The Health Service Executive has confirmed that it fully accepts the recommendations made by Professor O'Neill and has already addressed many of these that apply to the HSE.  My Department and the HSE are working together to implement the report's recommendations. An internal inquiry was not undertaken by the HSE.The HSE examined all complaints and has ongoing communication with the Leas Cross Relatives Action Group through the Office of the HSE Director of Consumer Affairs and there is a good working relationship between the two organisations.The Director's staff have met with all the complainants in respect of relatives who resided in Leas Cross Nursing Home and is currently addressing a comprehensive list of queries that were raised by the Relatives Action Group at their meeting with the Minister on 18th December 2006.On 26th January 2007, the newly appointed National Director for the PCCC established the Leas Cross Task Force Group which comprises senior management staff in the HSE Dublin North East and whose remit is to identify, coordinate and finalise all outstanding issues that pertain to Professor O'Neill's report.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	752	My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Health Service Executive to arrange to have the specific case investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.As the Deputy is aware, the development of a new National Paediatric Hospital is being overseen by a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group.  The current stage of the process involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, the appropriate number of beds, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital through the urgent/ambulatory care service, and on the location(s) for this service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services.Among other key items being addressed by the Group is the determination of co-ordination policies between the new hospital and other hospitals (including those outside of Dublin).
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	753	Statutory responsibility for the collation, management and publication of data on waiting times for in-patient and day-case procedures for public patients rests with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  My Department has, therefore, asked the Chief Executive of the NTPF to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the information requested in regard to public patients.Information relating to the waiting times for private patients is not collected by my Department, the Health Services Executive or the National Treatment Purchase Fund.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	754	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 102 together.I am familiar with the approach being adopted by the Health Service Executive in seeking to improve safety and standards across the acute hospital network in the North East Region, having regard to the issues raised in the Teamwork Management Services Report — "Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East".The Teamwork Report included a number of recommendations to improve patient care in the region.  It particularly highlighted the need to develop a high quality, responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards.  It recommended that there be one major regional hospital in the North East, supported by the five existing local hospitals including Our Lady's Hospital, Navan.  The new hospital is to provide emergency and trauma services on a 24 hour basis and also provide planned specialist procedures that are complex and require the facilities of a large regional hospital.The HSE has given me an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of this report, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.The hospital reconfiguration process is being overseen by the HSE Steering Group which is leading the project.  No decision has been made to date on the location of the new hospital. A sub-committee of the Steering Group has been established to progress the issue of site selection.  A tender for consultancy is to be awarded shortly for an independent site location study. The study will take account of various criteria including demographics, access, planning and development considerations and interdependencies.The first step in the development of a fully integrated regional health service is to ensure that the people of the North East have local access to both routine planned care and immediate life saving emergency care.  Over the next few years, in preparation for all acute emergency in-patient care and complex planned care being provided at a regional centre, services at the existing five hospitals will continue to be improved.

Capital initiatives this year by the OMC and for the directly funded agencies primarily relate to on-going approved projects.  Details in relation to new capital initiatives under these programmes are expected to be finalised shortly.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	757	Policy in relation to school attendance, including consideration of requirements when a child is absent due to illness, is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.General Practitioners are private medical practitioners in their own right. The State contracts with GPs for the provision of services under a number of Schemes, the most significant of which is the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. Neither the Health Service Executive nor my Department collects information which would enable the impact of schools' certification requirements on doctors' workload to be assessed.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	758	I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 86 together.I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions the background to the selection of the site for the new National Paediatric Hospital.  The development of the National Paediatric Hospital is being overseen by a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group.The current stage of the process involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	760	Community Rating has been an important factor in keeping the cost of health insurance at an affordable level over people's lifetimes and in particular their old age.  The ultimate beneficiary of risk equalisation is the insured population, particularly the elderly and the ill, who would otherwise be vulnerable to the effect of risk selection, and would find the cost of health insurance unaffordable when it was needed the most.Risk Equalisation helps ensure that community rating is sustainable into the future and the recent High Court decision, arising from a challenge to the Government's right to regulate the private health insurance market, was a strong endorsement of the regulatory framework, including the risk equalisation scheme. A community rated market cannot exist without a supporting mechanism like risk equalisation.A market without the balancing measure of risk equalisation to address the effect of mandatory community rating exposes insurers with higher risk members to spiralling claims and ultimately threatens their viability while opening the possibility of super-normal profits being made by other insurers, at the expense of consumers and the insured community as a whole.The Government is also committed to ensuring that competition in the market works to the benefit of all health insurance subscribers. To that end, I will consider the recommendations from the Reports of both the Competition and Health Insurance Authorities which I have already received, and from the Barrington Group when it reports back to me at the end of this week.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	761	I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 103 together.General Practitioner vocational training is conducted under the auspices of the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP) through vocational training programmes funded by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  There are 11 such programmes and these are accredited by the ICGP.  General Practitioner Trainers are responsible for providing to GP trainees, within their practices, post-graduate vocational training and practical experience in the clinical, organisational and other dimensions of general practice.  In the majority of training schemes the duration of such training is three years.As the Deputy's question relates to a matter which falls within the remit of the Health Service Executive, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter  and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	762	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 153 together.The Health Service Executive (HSE) is at an advanced stage in a public procurement process in relation to the co-location of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals.I understand that the HSE proposes to issue Invitations To Tender to the shortlisted bidders in the next few days and that tenders are to be returned by the end of April. The HSE will then evaluate the tenders and the successful bidders should be selected in May. Following that a "stand still" period of 2 weeks is required by procurement law before Project Agreements can be signed with the successful bidders.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	763	Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, including responsibility for the collection of data on hospital activity, is a matter for the Health Service Executive.  My Department has, therefore, requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the question raised with regard to the average waiting period in a Dublin hospital Accident and Emergency Department.Improving the delivery of Accident and Emergency services is the Government's top priority in health.  Our objectives are to reduce the numbers waiting for admission, the time spent waiting for admission, and the turnaround time for those who can be treated in A & E and do not require admission.The Health Service Executive continues to report significant improvements in the number of patients in A & E departments who are awaiting admission to an acute bed as compared with the same period last year.  The average number of patients awaiting admission during March is 59% lower than the equivalent period twelve months ago.Last year the HSE introduced a target of 24 hours within which all patients should be admitted, following the decision to admit.  This target is being achieved by the vast majority of hospitals.  The HSE is working closely with the small number of hospitals who are continuing to experience difficulties to assist them in reaching this target.  The HSE has announced that it will be introducing a revised target of 12 hours within which a patient should be admitted, following the decision to admit.  The HSE is also to introduce a monitoring system to record the total time patients spend in A & E departments, from the time they arrive to the time they are either discharged or admitted.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	764	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 54 and 97 together.I do not believe that the co-location of private hospitals on public hospital sites will have adverse consequences for public or private patients, whether for reasons cited by the Deputies or otherwise.  It is a core requirement of the ongoing public procurement exercise that the private bidders can demonstrate to the Health Service Executive that the co-located hospital will have the staff and facilities to treat private patients that are currently receiving treatment in the public hospital.  Medical and surgical services at the co-located hospital will have to be provided by appropriately qualified staff.The co-located hospitals will be required to have a clinical governance strategy including clinical audit and to develop proposals to provide access to training within the private facility.  It is a critical factor of the co-location initiative and of the new consultants contract that private work will be managed so as not to be to the detriment of public patients and public services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	765	The issues of nurses' pay and working hours have been fully processed through the State's industrial relations structures and procedures — the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  While health service management have accepted the Labour Court Recommendation, the Irish Nurses Organisation and Psychiatric Nurses Association state that they have neither accepted nor rejected this Recommendation and instead served notice of industrial action.The INO and PNA had been due to commence industrial action from 12 March 2007.  This action would have involved a nationwide work to rule and short work stoppages.  Following contacts between Government representatives and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) it was agreed to put in place an intensive time bound process of engagement under the aegis of the National Implementation Body (NIB), to address the issues underpinning the dispute, taking account of the relevant Labour Court recommendations.  The INO and PNA agreed to postpone their industrial action until 2 April.The talks commenced on 12 March and are due to conclude tomorrow 30 March.  In addition to the INO and PNA, SIPTU who are not in dispute, are represented at the talks.  The talks are concentrating on two main issues — the claim for a reduction in the working week from 39 to 35 hours and the perceived pay anomaly in the Intellectual Disability sector.  The NIB have requested both sides to refrain from public comment on the discussions while the process is ongoing and this has been agreed by the parties.  At the end of this week, a detailed position statement is due to be prepared by the National Implementation Body and presented to both sides for their consideration.I believe that this process is the best prospect of finding a satisfactory solution and I would like to state that officials from my Department and the HSE are fully and positively engaged in the process.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	766	The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 provide the statutory basis for the imposition of charges for persons in receipt of inpatient services whether or not such persons have full (medical card) or limited eligibility.  These regulations provide for two different classes of person on whom charges can be levied and the maximum charge which can be imposed in respect of each class.  With effect from 14 July 2005, charges may be levied on persons who are in receipt of in-patient services in premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hours basis, and in premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis.  The Regulations provide for a different level of charge in respect of each class, as set out below.Class 1 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.  In this case, a weekly charge of €120 can be levied or the total weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser.  Class 2 refers to people in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.  In this situation, a weekly charge of €90 can be levied, the total weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.In July 2005, the Health Service Executive (HSE) informed all patients (or their representatives) currently in their care that patients could be liable to pay a weekly charge in line with the 2005 regulations.  Patients were advised that the amount of the weekly charge was subject to a financial assessment.  Patients admitted after July 2005 are informed that they may be liable for a charge under the 2005 regulations and that a financial assessment will be completed.The purpose of the financial assessment is to ascertain the weekly income and outgoings of the patient to ensure that payment of the charge does not cause undue financial hardship to the patient.  Following the completion of the financial assessment, the HSE informs the patient and/or his/her representative of the charge that will be raised in respect of in-patient services.  This letter includes information on how the charge is calculated.The patient or his/her representative is also advised that they should contact the local administrator if they believe that payment of the charge would cause them undue hardship.  Where appropriate, next of kin or patient representatives are also informed of the process in place for raising the charge and given the opportunity to advise on any expenses the patient incurs on a weekly basis.  The patient, or their representative may also appeal the charge applied if they are unhappy with the decision.The patient or his/her representative are advised that they have a choice regarding how the charge is collected.  The HSE can invoice the patient or their representative on a monthly basis or the patient may choose to ask the HSE to become an agent on their Department of Social and Family Affairs payment book.  If the patient chooses the latter, the HSE arranges to deduct the charge from the DSFA weekly payment.  The remainder of the money from the DSFA weekly payment is either given to the patient or lodged to the patient's individual Patients Private Property Account, whichever is more appropriate.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	769	My Department recognises the importance of physical activity in the prevention of illness such as cardiovascular disease and stroke.  It is also recognised that lack of physical activity is contributing to increased levels of obesity.  The Report of the National Taskforce on Obesity — Obesity the Policy Challenges — was published in 2005 and contained 93 recommendations aimed at tackling overweight and obesity.  The Health Service Executive has established a Working Group to implement the health sector recommendations of the Taskforce on Obesity for which the HSE has the lead responsibility and for which €3 million has been allocated.  In 2006 eight additional posts focused on obesity were secured and a number of new initiatives commenced and are continuing.The HSE is working with the Community Games Association to integrate health promotion as a priority in their strategic plan.  This plan addresses nutrition and physical activity as well as other key health promotion topics.  The partnership with the Education Sector is progressing.  The HSE has also developed a strategic alliance with the Irish Sports Council, and have part-funded the Local Sports Partnerships to promote physical activity.The Taskforce recognises that a multi-sectoral approach is necessary, involving other state agencies and Departments and real engagement of the public and private sectors to implement all of the report's recommendations.  My Department is currently finalising proposals for the development of a mechanism which will facilitate inter-sectoral working on the prevention of chronic diseases, including obesity.  Promotion of healthy lifestyles, including physical activity, will be a key part of this approach.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	770	The National Immunisation Office, which is part of the Population Health Directorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for overseeing the day to day implementation of the Immunisation Programme, including vaccine procurement and management of the National Cold Chain Delivery Service.  Vaccines are procured from manufacturers based on national requirements and are delivered at specified regular intervals to the Cold Chain distributors.The "Cold Chain" is the system of correct storage, transport and maintenance of vaccines to ensure that they are protected from inappropriate temperatures and light from the time of manufacture to the time of administration.  The National Cold Chain Delivery Service has been in operation since 2005.  This service is provided under contract by a pharmaceutical distribution company.  All vaccines are stored and delivered under temperature controlled conditions to General Practitioners surgeries, HSE health centres and hospitals, ensuring compliance with Irish Medicines Board (IMB) licensing requirements.This delivery system is continuously monitored to ensure that the Cold Chain is maintained and that vaccines are distributed efficiently and is overseen by the National Immunisation Office.  Since the introduction of the National Cold Chain Delivery Service, there has been a significant reduction in vaccine wastage and there is now a comprehensive vaccine tracking system from the manufacturer to GP surgery, health centre or hospital.I have been informed by the HSE that in the past few weeks there was a temporary shortage of BCG vaccine in Ireland.  BCG vaccination is carried out on newborn babies in maternity hospitals and HSE health centres by HSE community health doctors.  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG for Ireland — Statens Serum Institute (SSI) based in Denmark.  The HSE has a contract with SSI to provide annual requirements for BCG.  These are sent under temperature controlled conditions on a  planned basis.  The shortage was caused when two shipments in 2006 had problems.  One shipment arrived into the country outside the temperature requirements and could not be used.  Any vaccine that has not been stored at a temperature as per licensing conditions is no longer a licensed product.  A second vaccine order had a manufacturing problem and so was not sent from Denmark.An alternative batch of BCG arrived into Ireland in December but this did not meet IMB requirements and therefore could not be distributed.  From the middle of December there were no supplies centrally for distribution, however, there were supplies still available locally in a number of areas up to the beginning of February.  All HSE staff were informed about the situation on a regular basis to ensure clinics were not scheduled when there was no vaccine available.BCG vaccine was delivered to the Cold Chain Distributors and became available for delivery on 16 February.  The Cold Chain Distributors immediately ensured that back orders were filled.  Further BCG deliveries are scheduled for March and May of this year.  The HSE is in contact with the company to ensure continuation of quality supply.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	773	The development of Services for Older People is a priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to Services for Older People in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  Last year, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in Services for Older People with a full year cost of €150 million.  This year a full year package of €255 million has been allocated for Services for Older People.  This gives a total of over €400 million added to services for older people over two years.Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The Action Plan for Dementia, published in 1999, describes a model of best practice for the provision and planning of dementia care in Ireland.There is a complementary link between Government policy in the area of the care of older people and care for people with dementia.  Both policies stress the need to provide support in dignity and independence, through the provision of appropriate services to the people concerned and their carers.  The Government is fully committed to providing such support and service improvement, including the expansion of community and residential care services for people with dementia.  This commitment is reflected in the additional funding of approximately €109 million in Budget 2006 and  €82 million in Budget 2007 which was allocated to community supports for older people, including those with dementia.  These supports include Home Care Packages, the Home Help Scheme and Respite Care.The additional funding provided for Home Care Packages and the Home Help Scheme will further enhance the supports available to families caring for people with dementia at home.  In 2006 a total of 2,000 extra Home Care Packages were provided at a full year cost of €55 million (prior to this date only 1,100 Packages had been in operation on a pilot basis).  A similar increase in the number of Packages will be provided in 2007, benefiting some 4,000 people.  An additional €21 million has been provided in 2007 to fund the cost of some 780,000 additional Home Help hours in 2007.  This brings the total funding allocated to Home Helps to approximately €171 million per annum.Among the areas where funding has been provided are day care and respite care which are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people.  Day care and respite care offer respite for family members and/or carers and provide social stimulation in a safe environment for older people with mild forms of dementia.  The provision of an additional €9 million in 2006 funded a further 1,325 additional places per week in these centres, together with additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy.  It also means that many day care centres can increase the number of days per week they open.  Additional funding of €3.5 million provided in Budget 2007 will cater for a further 1,100 day places per week in day care centres.The HSE has responsibility for the planning and management of capital projects in the health sector, including the development of services for people suffering from Dementia.  The HSE's capital plan for 2007 has recently been approved and includes an allocation of €107 million for older people specific projects.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction (CAHR) was established in March 2000.  Its terms of reference were to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all aspects of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.  The CAHR was composed largely of persons with expert knowledge spanning medical, scientific, social and legal domains; this expertise was a prerequisite to a precise examination of the issues concerned.The Commission published its report in May 2005.  This was the first step in determining a policy response to Assisted Human Reproduction (AHR) and it made 40 recommendations on AHR services in Ireland.  The key recommendation of the Commission is that a regulatory body should be established by an Act of the Oireachtas to regulate AHR services in Ireland.  The Commission proposed that this body be accountable to the Minister for Health and Children and that it would have regulatory, advisory and executive powers in relation to permitted AHR services.The Government decided to refer the report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children so that the Committee could consider and report in due course on its views of the recommendations of the Commission.  The Committee was considered an appropriate forum in which to subject the report to structured democratic and political analysis and scrutiny.In the meantime, cognisant of the amount of work required, I instructed my Department to begin work on the development of an appropriate regulatory framework.  As part of the analysis of the complex issues involved in AHR, the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee, when completed, along with any judgment of the Supreme Court in the R v R (frozen embryos) case, will be taken into account.I am also conscious of the financial burden that AHR treatment can place on couples.  I have therefore asked my Department to consider policy in this regard also.  Finally, persons undergoing AHR treatment services are eligible for tax relief on medical expenses incurred; the Drugs Payment Scheme also covers a number of drugs used as part of such treatment.

The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person.  Living people who were wrongly charged are being prioritised for payment under the scheme.The HSE has estimated that there are now in the region of 14,000 people within this category.  A dedicated website, www.repay.ie, an information phone line 1890 886 886 and an e-mail facility queries@repay.ie have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 9.00 am and 6.00 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  Queries in relation to individual applications should be referred to the scheme administrator.  The HSE has indicated that the total cost of the repayment scheme will be approximately €1 billion.  The Department of Finance has earmarked funding of €360 million for 2007.  The cost of total repayments made under the scheme will be dependent on the number of applications received.Offers of repayment commenced in late 2006 and over 1,100 payments have already issued with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis.  The HSE has indicated that approximately €24 million has been repaid to date.  It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence later in the year.  Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008.  It is anticipated that the majority of repayments will be made by mid-2008.It should be noted that under Data Protection legislation information relating to individual claims cannot be provided to third parties and in this regard, all enquiries in relation to individual claims should be made by the applicant concerned.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	787	Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme (LTI).  The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments.  The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.Products which are necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to LTI patients.  Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.Non-medical card holders and people whose illness is not covered by the LTI can use the Drug Payment Scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs.  Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month, or approximately €20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that non-reimbursed medical expenses above a set threshold may be offset against tax.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	789	As the Deputy may be aware, my Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  The review of the Irish Pharmaceutical Health Care Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI) Agreements, with the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, was completed in mid-2006 and the new agreements are in place.Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee, the State entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation (PDF).  As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, the State intended to negotiate, for the first time, direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector, to address the cost of wholesale supply to hospital and community through fair, transparent and accountable cost structures.In particular, the State wished to examine the high margin, relative to the EU, for wholesale supply to community pharmacy and the wholesalers' claim that they supply hospitals at a loss.  However, while PDF was willing to negotiate new arrangements for hospital supply, it refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply.  This refusal was based on legal advice that such negotiation would interfere with agreed trading terms of third parties, community pharmacists, and expose PDF to prosecution.Subsequent advice to the HSE indicated that the PDF position was too narrow.  As wholesalers and pharmacists are undertakings for the purposes of competition law, PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings and collective negotiation of fees, prices or margins on behalf of their members breaches section 4.1 of the 2002 Competition Act.Section 4.1 prohibits all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have the object or effect of restricting or distorting competition, including agreements to fix prices, unless the agreement, decision or concerted practice meets certain conditions.  I have been advised that those conditions are not met in this case.Wholesalers and pharmacy contractors are undertakings.  Therefore, PDF and the IPU are associations of undertakings and come under Section 4.1 of the Act.  The coming together of wholesalers under PDF or pharmacy contractors under the IPU to negotiate prices would be a breach of Section 4.1.  Acting in contravention of Section 4.1 is a criminal offence and would expose those parties and their officials to the risk of criminal prosecution.In light of the implications for GP and dental contract negotiations, the Department sought the Attorney General's views.  The Attorney General and Senior Counsel engaged by the Attorney General confirmed the HSE advice.  Given this position, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins and such negotiations places these bodies at risk of prosecution.As with the rest of the supply chain, the State has been examining how to improve value for money and transparency and fairness in relation to the cost of service provision in community pharmacy.  The State intended to address the review through negotiation with the IPU, as in the past.  This is no longer possible for fees, although contractual matters other than fees may be negotiated.Accordingly, the negotiating team re-examined, in light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, how best to address the review of pharmacy contractor services.  The HSE wrote to all community pharmacy contractors in January, setting out the situation in detail and stating that the HSE is constrained from negotiating fees with the IPU for the reasons outlined, and the IPU was fully briefed.  A meeting was held on 21 February between the negotiating team and the IPU, to agree a procedure to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  Following that meeting, agreement was reached on talks to examine options for contract review that would comply fully with competition law.  The talks will be chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC.  It is expected that the talks will begin within the next few days.The State continues to recognise the IPU as the representative body for its members, but negotiations with the union must comply with the law.  The legal issues that emerged during the wholesale sector review were raised by the wholesaler representatives.  Once the State became aware of these issues, it was no longer possible to continue as intended.  There is, and will continue to be, ongoing dialogue with the IPU as the representative body for pharmacists, within the constraints of the competition legislation.  The negotiating team will consider, in the context of competition law and in particular the relevant Competition Authority guidelines, all available options for advancing the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health.  I am satisfied that the Cabinet Committee process for review of the supply of drugs to the State is progressing effectively, within the constraints of relevant legislation.

This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing the level and range of multidisciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.

Heads of a Bill are being prepared for consideration by Government to regulate the use of sunbeds, including prohibiting their use by those under 16.  The proposals will also provide for the compulsory placing of warning notices in sunbed salons and other places where sunbeds are available for use by the public.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	794	At the end of December 2006 there were a total of 1,674 whole time equivalent public health nurses (1,978 individual public health nurses) employed by the Health Service Executive.  This year the HSE is sponsoring 156 nurses to undertake the higher diploma in Public Health Nursing.  The annual cost of this programme is in excess of €7 million.  The projected supply from these training courses is expected to meet current demand.In addition to public health nurses, care in the community is delivered by a mix of different skills and disciplines e.g. registered general nurses, home helps and health care assistants. In certain geographical areas, public health nurse vacancies are waiting to be filled.  In these areas, registered general nurses and health care assistants are employed to enhance the skill mix and maximise the services of the existing public health nurses in that area.Primary Care Teams, of which nursing will be a key component, are currently being developed by the HSE in line with the Primary Care Strategy and the targets set in the Towards 2016 agreement.  The precise composition of teams will depend on the needs, demographics and geographic location of the population served.  Recruitment of staff for the teams is ongoing.I have no doubt that the HSE fully recognises that workforce planning is a dynamic process and must continue to be conscious of future developments and additional future demands particularly, in the context of the most effective use of all human resources and skill mix.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The aim of the National Cancer Control Strategy, which was published in June 2006, is to reduce our cancer incidence, morbidity and mortality rates relative to other Member States of the European Union.  This Government is committed to investing significantly in the implementation of the Strategy to build on the improvements we have made in recent years, particularly the improvements in survival in all the major cancers.The HSE, at my Department's request, is conducting a national needs assessment for cancer control which will set out priorities in the medium term.  I have made available an additional €20.5m this year for cancer control.  This is an increase of 74% on the comparable 2006 investment and includes €3.5 million to support the initial implementation of the HSE National Cancer Control Programme.  The Programme will manage, organise and deliver cancer control on a whole population basis.  It will have a strong emphasis on prevention and early detection, integrated across primary, hospital, supportive and palliative care.The Service Plan of the HSE for this year sets out the detailed deliverables of the Programme.  The main priorities are the establishment of the leadership team to implement the Programme, including the Director of the Programme and key medical leaders at national and network level.  My Department is expecting a detailed submission from the HSE shortly which will be considered as a matter of priority in consultation with the Department of Finance.

Section 24 of the Health Act 2004 empowers the HSE to engage such advisers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions.  Any fees due to an adviser so engaged are payable by the HSE out of funds at its disposal.The Health Act 2004 also sets out the HSE's responsibilities in relation to codes of standards of integrity, conduct and governance.   Under Section 35 of the Act, the HSE is obliged to submit a Code of Governance for my approval.  A draft Code of Governance was received from the Executive at the end of September 2006.  It comprises a suite of documents which make up a Framework for the Corporate and Financial Governance of the HSE.  The contents of this Code are being assessed by my Department and discussions are being finalised with other Departments/Offices that have an interest in this issue.  I anticipate that the examination of the Code will be completed shortly and I will be in contact with the HSE at that point.In relation to function of advisory councils, in October 2006, the HSE launched four Expert Advisory Groups (EAGs) to advise on the organisation and development of health and personal social services in the areas of Children, Diabetes, Mental Health and Older People.  EAGs provide a central platform within the HSE for clinical and health communities, patients, clients, managers and carers to become actively involved in the development and transformation of specific health and social care services.  They provide opportunities for front line professionals to use their knowledge and experience to influence operational policy development within the HSE.  They also enable recognised leaders to apply their expertise and, where possible, bring an international perspective to the health transformation programme.EAGs ensure that the highest international standards of care and best practice and integral to the HSE planning process.  In addition, they play a key role in driving integration across the HSE's three service delivery units — National hospitals Office (NHO); Primary, Community and Continuing Care (PCCC) and Population Health and also in promoting national consistency.  Each EAG has 20 members and meets on a monthly basis.  Since their establishment, each of the Groups have met several times and identified the main issues which they will focus on into the future.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	800	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 91 together.I have been informed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) that the statistical information is not collected in the format requested.  However, set out as follows are the principles guiding the provision of school screening services in this country."Best health for Children" introduced national recommendations on Child Health Screening and Surveillance Programme in 1999 and these were revised in 2005.  In summary, current recommendations regarding Child Health Screening that should be offered to children attending primary school are as follows:Health assessment at school entry, with follow-up selective medical examination where necessary.Hearing screening at school entry.Vision screening at school entry and at school exit.The school screening service is Public Health Nursing led and where anomalies are discovered, children are referred to the Area Medical Officer service, Community Ophthalmology or a service relevant to the issue that has been highlighted.  Should any urgent medical issues arise, an appropriate referral is advised.  There is coverage of all public primary schools and uptake rates are very satisfactory.  In areas where the service is unable to visit all schools during the school year, the outstanding schools are visited as early as possible the following school year.  Particular emphasis is placed on children who join a school who have not had a previous school health examination and in these cases all elements of the screening programme are provided to those children.A Health Assessment Questionnaire for completion by parents has also been introduced in some areas and based on the review of these questionnaires by the school Public Health Nurse, children are referred to school Medical Clinics at their local Health Centre if necessary.  In the case of a child being absent on the day of screening parents are offered the facility of bringing their child to the local Health Centre for screening at a nurse-led Child Health Clinic.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	801	As part of the arrangements for the appointment of Professor Brendan Drumm as Chief Executive Officer, the Board of the HSE agreed that support and advisory resources would be provided for the implementation of the health service reform programme.  Section 24 of the Health Act, 2004 empowers the HSE to engage such advisers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions.  Any fees due to an adviser so engaged are payable by the HSE out of funds at its disposal.It was agreed that one of the roles would be filled immediately by internal re-assignment and a second by secondment.  The remaining three roles were of a consultancy nature and were filled through a public procurement process.  I understand that all of these advisers are contracted to provide 135 days each per annum but that different annual rates applied to each individual.  Where work is required in excess of the 135 days, a per diem rate applied.  This is capped at 20%, i.e. 27 days per annum.The HSE is of the view that the daily rates provided for in the contracts involved are not excessive when compared with daily norms for management consultancy input across the public sector and the economy as a whole.  The individuals concerned are actively assisting the CEO in implementing the health reform programme, which is the most ambitious reform programme in the history of the State.  In relation to whether a value for money audit should be conducted by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), the C&AG is an independent Constitutional Officer, appointed by the President on the nomination of the Dáil.  It would not be a matter for me, as Minister for Health and Children to instruct or advise his Office as to what work should be carried out.  However, I would, of course, assist in any way possible any audit which he may see fit to carry out, in any area which he may feel warranted examination.By way of additional information, it is worth noting that the Health Act 2004 sets out the HSE's responsibilities in relation to codes of standards of integrity, conduct and governance.  Under Section 35 of the Act, the HSE is obliged to submit a Code of Governance for my approval.  A draft Code of Governance was received from the Executive at the end of September 2006.

Under this scheme, patients who are stabilized on their medication no longer need to visit their general practitioner every month in order to have their prescriptions renewed.Changes in GMS prescriptions from monthly to quarterly for suitable patients have created efficiencies for general practitioners and patients, by reducing unnecessary consultations and journeys to the GP and pharmacy.  As monthly and repeat prescriptions attract the same dispensing fee, there are no savings for the Health Service Executive in terms of pharmacy fees.

Dublin and the disposal of the site at Dundrum.  The Health Service Executive has established a project team to progress the redevelopment of the Central Mental Hospital.  A new governance structure will be put in place for the Central Mental Hospital in advance of its move to the new site.Pending the provision of a new hospital at Thornton Hall, the Health Service Executive will continue to ensure that facilities and services at the Central Mental Hospital are improved and enhanced in a patient focused manner.There have been significant developments at the hospital in recent years.  The practice of "slopping-out" was ended in 2006.  There are currently five fully-staffed, consultant-led multi-disciplinary teams in place in the hospital, with a further team to be developed in 2007.  All patients now have access to an independent advocacy service.  Additional funding of €2 million was allocated in 2007 to increase the capacity at the hospital and provide additional residential places in the community for discharged patients.As the Deputy may be aware, a report of an inquiry into the care and treatment practices at the Central Mental Hospital was published by the Mental Health Commission in January of this year.  The Health Service Executive, which is firmly committed to improving services to patients at the hospital, has submitted an Action Plan to the Commission setting out the steps and timescale for implementation of the recommendations in the Report.

This will result in the creation of additional Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and High Dependency Bed capacity at the hospital.It should be noted that there has been an overall increase in bed numbers in St James's of 140 in the period 2000-2006 and that ICU capacity at St James's Hospital has been increased over the past three years from 9 to 14 beds.The HSE has advised that when procedures requiring post-operative critical care accommodation are postponed to cater for emergency admissions, the procedures are rescheduled as soon as possible.The HSE is conducting a national review of acute bed capacity at present which will include an assessment of future critical care requirements.  The HSE has also included a commitment in its 2007 Service Plan to review future critical care requirements beyond the issue of bed capacity, to ensure that service is developed in line with international best practice.  A multi-disciplinary project group is being established to facilitate this review.In relation to the specific issue of the number of major operations postponed, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

This will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme (ICSP).  The total allocation to the new Service is €33m; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes.  This includes additional funding of €5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the ICSP by the end of the year.The National Cancer Screening Service is planning to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	806	I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 96 together.In July 2005, I announced an initiative designed to provide up to 1,000 additional beds for public patients.  This is to be achieved through the development of private hospitals on the sites of public hospitals, transferring private activity to those hospitals and freeing up beds currently reserved for private patients.As the charges levied on private health insurers for treating private patients in public hospitals are subsidised, the transfer of 1,000 beds will impact on private health insurance costs as private hospitals will have to charge the full economic rate, including the need for return on their capital investment.  However, it is in any case, long standing Government policy that the full economic rate should be charged for private beds in public hospitals.There are other cost drivers associated with increases in premiums apart from the cost of the bed.  These include the costs associated with an ageing population, increasing drugs costs and accelerated technology innovation.However, I do not believe that, in the context of approximately €1 billion in health insurance premia now being paid in Ireland, the additional cost, over some years, of fully charged beds in public or private hospitals, or in co-located facilities, will provide an insuperable challenge to the private health insurance market or will make insurance unaffordable.

I understand that the HSE is working with the hospitals concerned to clear the backlog by referring smears to accredited laboratories in the US.  The HSE has informed my Department that it has reviewed hospital services, including cytology, and is planning on the basis of a 4 week turnaround time in reporting.  I have requested the HSE to achieve this target as quickly as possible.

This includes persons who are admitted to the hospital as a day case.  These are the only circumstances under which a statutory charge of €60 can be raised.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind she might forward the details to me and I will have it investigated by the Health Service Executive.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	818	I wrote to the Garda Commissioner on 31 May 2005, requesting that he discuss with the Health Service Executive (HSE) certain issues which had come to light in relation to Leas Cross Nursing Home.  The Commissioner met with the HSE and it was agreed that the HSE would conduct an initial examination of all the circumstances in respect of patients at Leas Cross Nursing Home.The Leas Cross report was published by the Health Service Executive on the 10th November 2006 and forwarded to An Garda Síochána.  I understand a Chief Superintendent has been appointed to follow up on any criminal matters that may arise from the report.  I further understand that a meeting was scheduled between the National Director of the Primary Community and Continuing Care (PCCC) of the HSE and the Chief Superintendent for 27th March 2007.  The Garda Commissioner has not made any contact with the Department of Health and Children.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,476 (or over 23%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period.  The combined strength (all ranks), of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training on 14 March, 2007 was 14,258.  Furthermore, I should say that on 19 December, 2006, as part of a package of anti-crime measures, the Government approved the continuation of the existing Garda recruitment programme to achieve a total Garda strength of 15,000.  The accelerated intake of approximately 1,100 new recruits per annum into the Garda College will continue until this target is met.  The Garda Budget now stands at €1.4 billion, an 11% increase on 2006 and a 96% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Dunshaughlin Garda Station on 28 March, 2007 was 9 (all ranks).  Dunshaughlin Garda Station forms part of the Ashbourne Garda District.  The personnel strength of the Ashbourne Garda District on 31 December, 1997 and on 28 March, 2007 was 56 and 80 (all ranks) respectively.  This represents an increase of 24 (or 42%) in the number of personnel allocated since that date.Resources are further augmented by a number of Garda National Units such as the Garda National Drugs Unit, the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), other specialised units and the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), all of which have had increased resources.I have also been informed by the Garda authorities that Dunshaughlin Garda Station is open to the public from 10 am to 1 pm Monday to Saturday and 12 midday to 1 pm on Sunday.  Garda Management state that the Dunshaughlin area is patrolled on a 24 hours basis by  members attached to Dunshaughlin Garda Station, Dunboyne Garda Station and the District Headquarters at Ashbourne.Garda Management also state that there is currently no plan to open Dunshaughlin Garda Station on a 24 hour basis as this would necessitate the employment of additional Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends and other operational policing needs.  Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

Agreed Report 499 provides that members, who were serving on or after 1 January, 1993 would be entitled to a pension, based on unsocial hours allowances earnings with effect from 1 January, 1994.  This Agreement did not make provision in respect of members, who retired prior to 1 January, 1993.Garda pensions have not been reduced by €60 for members, who retired prior to 1 January, 1993.  However, the remuneration upon which their superannuation benefits is calculated does not include unsocial hours allowances.  Unsocial hours allowances are included in the remuneration upon which superannuation benefits are calculated for members who retired on or subsequent to 1 January, 1993.  This is in accordance with the regulations governing Garda superannuation benefits.

A three way consent is also required to enable any transfer to take place, i.e., from the authorities of both jurisdictions and from the person concerned.  On receipt of those consents (assuming they will be forthcoming), an application must then be made to the High Court for a warrant authorising the transfer of the person concerned and his continued detention here.These procedures are required under the Convention and the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Act, 1995, and must be adhered to in processing each application.

The current procedure used by An Garda Síochána was introduced following advice from the Law Officers.  In order to ensure that there is no doubt as to the person the victim or witness has identified, it is necessary that a clear identification is made.  This may be done in a number of ways, including pointing to or stating the position of a person on the line-up or stating a number assigned to them.  The requirement on a witness to place his or her hand on the suspect is no longer part of the administrative practice.The issue of identity parades was examined by the Expert Group appointed to consider changes in the criminal law recommended in the Garda SMI report, chaired by the late Eamon Leahy S.C., and more recently by the Balance in the Criminal Law Review Group, chaired by Dr. Gerard Hogan S.C..  I am reviewing the recommendations of these reports with a view to determining what improvements, if any, might be made to make the procedure less traumatic for victims.

This provision came into effect from 14th July, 2006.  The Accounting Officer is responsible for the proper expenditure of money from the Vote and the safeguarding of public funds and property.  He is accountable to the Oireachtas through the Public Accounts Committee and subject to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In line with the transfer of Accounting Officer functions, the Act also provides for the Garda Commissioner to enter into contracts for services and supplies and to hold bank accounts in the name of An Garda Síochána.One important control measure provided under the Act, is the provision to establish an Audit Committee, with a total of 4 external personnel (one of whom shall be chairperson) and all of whom are required to have relevant experience. None of these appointees can be a member or have been a member of An Garda Síochána. There is one Garda Member at Deputy Commissioner level on the Committee.  I appointed the Audit Committee in August last year to carry out their functions as set out in the Act.   In addition, as part of the preparation for the transfer of the functions to the Garda Commissioner, additional skilled civilian resources have been provided to An Garda Síochána.I am advised by the Garda Authorities that service contracts are awarded in accordance with national and EU procurement guidelines.  I am also advised that such contracts are normally of one year duration with options to renew at the discretion of the Garda Authorities.   Where proposed expenditure exceeds the delegated sanction limit authorised by the Department of Finance, a business case and request for sanction are submitted in each case to my Department so that appropriate sanction can be obtained.  It is then a matter for the Garda authorities to procure the requisite goods and  services and ensure that appropriate controls are in place.

The section provides stiff penalties —  fines up to €75,000 and/or up to 7 years imprisonment for conviction on indictment — for persons who contravene its provisions.  In addition, former Gardaí are also governed by the provisions of  the Official Secrets Act.  At an operational level, I understand from the Garda Authorities that members, log-on accounts for the Garda Information System (PULSE/GNIB/FCPS) are disabled upon their retirement.  This ensures that they cannot access any of the Garda IT systems.

The viaticum is for the purpose of covering the member's anticipated necessary travelling and subsistence expenses as a result of attending court.  Such civil proceedings would include insurance companies summonsing Garda members involved in the investigation of road traffic accidents where civil proceedings are instigated and result in court hearings.Paragraph 24.5(5) of An Garda Síochána Code provides for the  charging of fees to third parties, including insurance companies, when they request in writing an abstract of Garda reports, copies of witness statements, sketches/maps of scenes, etc. The fees charged are credited to the Garda Vote, through the relevant Garda District public bank accounts.

The purpose of the MOU is to provide a framework to facilitate the implementation and operation of a partnership wherein An Garda Síochána and AXA Insurance Company come together with the objective of providing a safe, efficient and effective method of removing and storing all mechanically propelled vehicles which have been involved in road traffic collisions in public places.I am further informed that a successful eight month pilot project was carried out in the South Eastern Region commencing on the 1 June, 2005 which resulted in an accrued saving of €10,000 to the Garda Vote. It is anticipated that a similar pilot under this MOU will be implemented in the DMR Region in the near future.

A dog has been used by customs officials at the airport continuously since 1991.  The annual cost of the dog team — including the salary of the dog handler — is approximately €86,000 with an initial start up cost of €54,000.The dog based in Shannon is trained to quickly pass over baggage, or through a group of people, and detect prohibited drugs by smell.  On detection, the dog sits and "points" at the location of the drugs.  The dog is then immediately removed by its handler, and further investigation is carried out by other members of the customs team.  Quite often, the dog is used to support or negate suspicions formed by customs officers observing traffic through the airport.  Because the dog always works as part of a larger team, separate statistics are not kept for detections by the dog.Over the last three years there have been 145 drug seizures with an estimated street value of €499,925 at Shannon Airport and the dog has been involved in a very significant number of them.  Revenue views the use of dogs as an essential part of its anti-smuggling activities, and has no intention of reducing the dog team's activities at Shannon.

Under both of these schemes tax relief has been provided for the refurbishment and construction of certain residential, commercial and industrial buildings.Following a major review of various property and area based tax incentive schemes I announced in Budget 2006 that most of the  existing  reliefs either had achieved the objectives set out for them or were no longer considered to be cost effective in terms of the objectives set out for them and were therefore being terminated subject to certain transitional provisions. These included the Urban Renewal and Town Renewal Schemes.   While I will continue to assess the role that time-limited tax relief schemes can play in supporting public policy objectives, there are no proposals at present to re-introduce tax incentive schemes along the lines of the ongoing Urban or Town Renewal Schemes in County Mayo.

The Health Service Executive has statutory responsibility for the implementation of these Regulations.Judgments as to whether a pre-school service is in compliance with the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997 are made on inspection by the pre-school services inspection teams of the Health Service Executive.  This responsibility will continue to lie with the Health Service Executive on the introduction of the Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 2006 on 3 September 2007.The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005.

It has been estimated that up to 95% of people's health and social services needs can be properly met within a primary care setting and the establishment of new Primary Care Teams can contribute greatly to enhancing community based health services.In the location in question, my Department provided some €510,000 in revenue and €235,000 in capital funding in 2002/2003 to enable the establishment of a Primary Care Team as one of the initial ten Primary Care Implementation Projects.  The provision of the appropriate infrastructure for the effective functioning of the teams is being considered by the HSE, having regard to a number of factors. These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.

No. 248 of 2000).  Responsibility for delivery of health services is a matter for the HSE.Children in specific classes in national school, usually second, fourth and sixth class, are targeted for preventive measures under the school based approach; the children in these classes are screened and referred for treatment as necessary; the programme has been specifically designed to ensure that children are dentally fit before they leave national school.  The screening provided in second, fourth and sixth classes ensures that follow up appointments for examination, treatment or orthodontic review are made, as necessary, with the Dental Surgeon in the clinic designated for the particular school(s).  Children who have attended national school retain eligibility to dental treatment up to their 16th birthday.The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, contains provision for the amendment of Section 66 of the Health Act, 1970 to provide for a health examination and treatment service for pupils attending any primary school.  The Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2006, also contains provision for the amendment of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1994 to provide dental health services to children attending any primary school.

The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract. This contract is a treatment-based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide GP medical and surgical services without charge to eligible persons; this includes persons aged 70 and over, who are automatically entitled to a medical card. The contract stipulates that the fees paid to GMS GPs are not made in respect  of certain certificates which may be required, for example, "under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences". As these non-treatment type services are outside the scope of the GMS GP contract, it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular service to agree a fee.While certificates for various applications are provided by medical practitioners, they are not a medical treatment service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	870	The development of Services for Older People is a priority for the Government.  This is reflected in the funding committed to services for older people in Budgets 2006 and 2007.  Last year, the Government funded the largest ever expansion in services for older people with a full year cost of €150m.  This year a full year package of €255m has been allocated for services for older people.  This gives a total of over €400m added to services for older people over two years. These include community supports — Home Care Packages, Home help Scheme and Respite Care.Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible and, where this is not possible, to support access to quality long-term residential care.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the latest partnership agreement, Towards 2016.In 2006 a total of 2,000 extra Home Care Packages were provided at a full year cost of €55 million (prior to this date only 1,100 packages had been in operation on a pilot basis).  A similar increase in the number of packages will be provided in 2007, benefiting some 4,000 people. An additional €21 million was provided for 2007 to fund the cost of some 780,000 additional home help hours in 2007.  This brings the total funding allocated to home helps to approximately €171 million per annum.Among the areas where funding has been provided are day care and respite care which are an integral part of delivering a comprehensive community service for older people. Day care and respite care offer respite for family members and/or carers and provide social stimulation in a safe environment for older people. The provision of an additional €9 million in 2006 allowed for 1,325 additional places per week in these centres together with additional programmes for specific needs such as activity therapy. It also means that many day care centres can increase the number of days per week they open. Additional funding of €3.5 million provided in Budget 2007 will cater for a further 1,100 day places per week in day care centres.Home Care Packages and other community based services are available following an assessment of need. Older People who have full time carers will be granted community based services if they are deemed to have a need and qualify.

Any necessary follow-up treatment is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system.An effective national cervical screening programme will result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer. It is my objective to have such a programme rolled out, beginning, late this year, based on an affordable model. For that purpose, on 1 January 2007, I established a National Cancer Screening Service which amalgamates BreastCheck and the Irish Cervical Screening Programme. The total allocation to the new Service is €33m; this is a 71% increase on the 2006 allocation to the Programmes. This includes additional funding of €5m for 2007 to the Service to commence roll out of the Cervical Screening Programme at the end of the year.

A national advertising campaign also commenced on this date which included advertisements in all the main national newspapers and on national and local radio.  The purpose of these advertisements is to advise residents and their families regarding their entitlement under the Health Repayment Scheme.  There is also a website and an information line (1890 886 886) to assist the public with their queries and to date over 39,000 call centre queries have been received.The HSE has also informed my Department that local HSE staff in long stay institutions have taken an active role in distributing application forms and information leaflets to the residents and/or their representatives.  Application forms and information leaflets are also available through the HSE Local Health Offices and Post Offices.  They also assist the resident and/or their representative in completing the application form and continue to deal with general queries in relation to the Health Repayment Scheme.  Under Data Protection legislation information on specific applications can only be provided to applicants and not to third parties.The Health Service Executive has also made applications to the Scheme Administrator in relation to residents who do not have the capacity to make the application themselves and who have no other connected person to make an application on their behalf.  This will ensure that eligible residents who do not have capacity to understand the Repayment Scheme receive repayment.

The current stage of the process involves the preparation of a high level framework brief for the new hospital.  The brief is being developed for the Transition Group by Rawlinson Kelly & Whittlestone Ltd (RKW), an established UK-based health care planning company.  RKW will be advising on a range of issues which will help to inform the design of the new hospital.  They will be advising, for example, on the preferred model of care, on the core services to be delivered at the new hospital, and on the additional range of services to be provided outside of the main hospital  through the urgent/ambulatory care service, and on the location(s) for this service, taking account of international best practice in the planning of children's hospital services. To date, no decision has been taken in relation to the range of services to be provided at the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the National Paediatric Hospital and the associated urgent/ambulatory care service. RKW is consulting widely in the course of its work, and in this context the input of all stakeholders will be of benefit in ensuring the delivery of our shared objective of providing a world-class hospital for the children of this country.

A limited number of projects were approved for funding by the Tourism Product Selection Board and expenditure of €1,219,179 was incurred towards the end of 2002.The mid-term evaluation by the ESRI of the NDP 2000-2006 in respect of the Marine Tourism sub-measure recommended that the indicative budget for this scheme be reallocated to other priority tourism measures. As a result there was no further expenditure for the remainder of the term of the programme.Under the new National Development Programme (2007-2013), investment in the development of the angling sector will be channelled through various NDP programmes including the Tourism Programme as well as the Marine and Coastal Communities Programme. Details of projected spend in 2007 and beyond will become available as sub-programmes are developed.

The Office of the Registrar General has responsibility for records relating to Births, Marriages and Deaths in the State.The Department contacted the Office of the Registrar General regarding the difficulties in obtaining a birth certificate in the case in question. The Office has told us that, to enable registration of birth to take place, the Informant who is to make the declaration (i.e. the remaining family member in this case) normally attends at the Office of the Registrar in order to sign the birth register. However, in a case where the Informant is resident abroad and physically unable to travel to Ireland, the General Registrar's Office may dispense with this requirement.It is suggested that the applicant should now contact the General Registrar's Office and explain the situation fully. Once the birth has been registered, the Passport Office will assist in issuing a passport to ensure that she may travel in June.

Where a project is being undertaken by an organisation other than a local authority, as is the case of the project in Loughrea, the proposal must be considered, supported and submitted by the local authority.  Before supporting such a project, the local authority must be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project when completed, would have a suitable level of public access.In order to protect the State's interest in any such project, in the context of grant aid provided, a Deed of Covenant and Charge must be put in place between my Department, the County Council and the developer.  Details of the terms of such a Deed are under discussion between my Department and Galway County Council/developer.

I intend to announce the grant allocations for the programme as soon as possible after the assessment process has been completed. For the Deputy's information, the club in question has already been allocated a total of €400,000 from previous sports capital programmes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	894	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.As part of the restructuring of CE approved in 1999, future participation in CE by an individual was capped at 3 years effective from April, 2000.  This change was introduced to discourage repeated participation in CE and to encourage unemployed persons to avail of training/education options where possible, which are shown to have more successful progression outcomes for individuals.  The three-year cap was amended in August 2001 to allow particularly disadvantaged persons to remain on the programme for a further period.  In general, approximately 20% of participants including persons less than 55 years of age may benefit from an additional year on the programme under the flexibility guidelines introduced in August 2001.   In November 2004, it was decided that the 3-year cap would be extended for CE participants aged over 55.  This category of participants is now eligible to participate on CE for a maximum of 6 years.In July 2006 my Department published its Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act, 2005.   One of the key highlights of this Plan is to increase participation rates of people with disabilities on CE over the period of the Plan and to raise the CE participation limits for people with disabilities, in order to provide additional training to assist progression to employment:For people with disabilities under 55 years of age, the participation limit has been raised by one year from 3 to 4 yearsFor people with disabilities over 55 years of age, the participation limit has also been raised by one year from 6 to 7 years.I am informed by FÁS that the participation limits to which I have referred will continue to be operated flexibly at local level.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	895	As indicated in previous replies to PQ 9319/07 dated 8th March 2007, and PQ 3052/07 of 31st January 2007, there is no record of a redundancy claim or appeal having been received in the Redundancy Section of this Department in respect of the person concerned.  However, if the Deputy has evidence to the contrary I will be happy to have the matter checked out on behalf of the individual concerned.On making an employee redundant, it is up to the employer to pay the statutory payment in the first instance.If an employee is dissatisfied with the decision of the employer, it is open to him to appeal the decision to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. However, such an appeal must be made within 12 months of the date of termination of employment. In exceptional cases, the Employment Appeals Tribunal may allow a further delay of 12 months.If the Deputy wishes, he may contact Ms Mary Fogarty, Redundancy Section at (01) 6313051 to discuss the matter further.

Some specific changes have been made to that legislation, most recently in the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005.Work is also being carried out by my Department, in consultation with the cooperative movement, in relation to the broader legislative framework which dates mainly from the 1890's.  This will identify and address the need for change and up-dating of the legislative framework, including in relation to powers of investigation.

Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.The HSE West has advised that the person concerned applied for two ENPs in November 2006 for connection of water supply and an ESB security deposit.  At the time the person concerned was living at home with his parents and the application was made in respect of property that he had inherited from deceased family relatives.The Community Welfare Officer asked the person concerned to provide copies of relevant legal documents that would prove ownership in addition to providing details of the property and any other capital received.  The executive required this information in order to establish the means of the person concerned to determine whether an ENP payment should issue.The person concerned provided documents relating to the deeds of the property but he did not provide documents relating to the receipt of the property and failed to fully disclose his income.  The Executive has advised that it refused the claim for ENPs from the person concerned, on the basis that he failed to provide sufficient details of his income.The person concerned was advised of his right to appeal this decision to the area appeals officer of the Executive.  The Executive has advised that no appeal has been received.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	898	Farmers, and self-employed people in general, who were already retired when compulsory social insurance was introduced for this group in 1988 cannot benefit from contributory pensions.  However, it is open to those who do not qualify for a contributory pension to apply for the state pension (non-contributory).  The new enhanced state pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years, which I introduced at the end of September last year, features significant improvements in the means test.  In Budget 2007 I was happy to be able to build on these improvements by increasing the basic income disregard to €30 per week (doubled for pensioner couples).  Allowances are also made in the means test for capital that a person might have, with up to €20,000 disregarded.  The capital allowance is doubled in the case of couples.  The State pension (non-contributory) was increased by €18 per week in Budget 2007, reaching the €200 per week target set by the Government.As the House is aware, the Government is preparing a Green Paper on pensions and it is expected that this will be finalised by the end of this month and published as soon as possible thereafter.  The Green Paper will include a discussion of all aspects of our pension system including the contribution that social welfare pensions can make to ensuring an adequate income for older people in retirement which is at the same time sustainable in the long-term.  The position of people who do not at present qualify for a pension will be considered in this context.  Following the publication of the Green Paper, a consultation process will then take place and the Government will respond to this by publishing a framework for future pensions policy.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	899	In order to qualify for state pension (contributory), a person must satisfy a number of qualifying conditions, namely:- have entered into insurable employment before age 56, have paid at least 260 weeks full-rate contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 10 contributions recorded (taking paid and credited PRSI Contributions into account) from 1953 or from the date of entry into insurance (whichever is the later) to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  A yearly average of 48 contributions is required for a maximum rate pension.The person concerned was refused state pension (contributory) on 19th January 2006 as she does not satisfy the basic paid requirement of 260 full rate contributions.Women who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were, in the main, public servants who were never insured for social welfare pension purposes.  Accordingly, any loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.That said, the Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.It is estimated that there are some 47,000 people who are not receiving a social welfare pension payment in their own right, or as a qualified adult on the pension of their spouse or partner.  These are mainly former public servants and self-employed people who were close to retirement or had retired before 1988, when the self-employed were brought within the social insurance system, together with their spouses.The issues in relation to this group will be discussed in the forthcoming Green Paper on pensions and decisions regarding pension provision for them will be made in the light of the consultation process which will follow its publication and in the framing of a long-term policy for overall pension provision.  The Green Paper is nearing completion and is due to be presented to Government shortly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	900	Approximately 76 per cent of workers pay PRSI Class A at the rate of 4 per cent.  A further 11 per cent of workers pay social insurance contributions at the Class S rate.  These contributions which are subject to various thresholds, allowances and ceilings, accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes.  The current employee PRSI ceiling stands at €48,800 per annum.It is estimated that a decrease in the employee PRSI rate from 4% to 2% would reduce Social Insurance Fund income by some €720 million in a full year.  The abolition of the PRSI ceiling for ordinary employees would yield some €295 million in additional contribution income.  A decrease in the self-employed PRSI rate (Class S) from 3% to 2% is estimated to cost approximately €220 million in a full year.  Of course if introduced as a package, the combination of measures could give rise to a compound effect.  Revisions to PRSI rates and the employee ceiling are considered annually in a budgetary context, with changes incorporated into the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005, as required.

Under Social Welfare regulations Child Benefit is payable to the person with whom a qualified child normally resides.  This is normally the child's mother.However, where the mother has abandoned or deserted the child or has failed to contribute to the support of the child, the child is regarded as normally resident with the person who has care and charge of the child and Child Benefit is payable to that person.  The grandparent in this case should submit a claim for Child Benefit and a decision will be made when all the relevant facts are established.Guardian's Payment (Contributory) and Guardian's Payment (Non-Contributory) may also be payable where a parent has abandoned and has failed to provide for a child, and the other parent is  unknown, or has also abandoned and failed to provide for the child, provided that the child is not normally residing with a parent, adoptive parent or step-parent.Family Income Supplement is a weekly tax-free payment for families at work on low pay.  If a grandparent is in receipt of child benefit for a child in their care and if they meet the qualifying conditions for the Family Income Supplement scheme they should submit an application for consideration.If the grandparent to whom the question refers is in receipt of a social welfare payment, then a child dependent allowance may also be payable.  If they wish to obtain further assistance in identifying any social welfare scheme that may be relevant to their particular circumstances, they should contact their Social Welfare Local Office.  Information is also available from my Department's LoCall telephone enquiry line on 1890 66 22 44 from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm, Monday to Friday.

That draft agreement provided for transitional arrangements for Ireland, relating to the phasing out of the ‘Shannon Stop'.In preparing the Plan, my Department has consulted with the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism, the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance.  A liaison group, established by the Mid West Regional Authority, has separately prepared a report on the future development of the Shannon region as an input to the Plan.  Following the endorsement of the EU-US Air Transport Agreement by the Council of Transport Ministers on 22 March I expect to be in a position to bring the Tourism and Economic Development Plan for Shannon to finalisation shortly.It is envisaged that the EU-US Air Transport Agreement will be signed on 30 April at the EU-US Summit in Washington and will enter into force on a provisional basis from 30 March 2008. The transitional arrangements relating to Ireland entered into effect immediately following the political agreement reached at the Council of Ministers on 22 March.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	906	My Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, titled ‘Transport Access for All', has been finalised and published. The Plan addresses the accessibility needs of people with mobility, sensory and cognitive impairments across all transport modes and contains time bound targets for the progressive realisation of accessible transport in Ireland.  In general, the timescales for the various elements of the Plan are expected to be completed within the timeframe of Transport 21.  The Plan was prepared following an extensive consultation exercise involving meetings and discussions with transport providers together with a wide range of groups in the disability sector. It was passed by the Oireachtas in October 2006 enabling it to take effect.Measures to implement ‘Transport Access for All' are already well advanced. Since the year 2000, all major refurbishment projects at bus and rail stations, together with the construction of new stations and the purchase of trains or buses take account of the needs of people with mobility and sensory impairments. Work in this area is now being extended to taxis as well as air and marine passenger transport.Significant resources for accessibility are being provided under Transport 21 to facilitate further progress. Accessibility is being built into new public transport infrastructure projects and funding is also being provided to continue the phased retrofit of existing infrastructure. Transport 21 has been endorsed by the recently published National Development Plan 2007-2013.Unfortunately, some people, because of the nature of their disabilities, will not be able to travel on public transport. In such cases, specialised non-public transport door-to-door services are the most appropriate complementary form of transport. Such services are generally provided by specialist agencies which do not form part of the public transport sector for which my Department has statutory responsibility.

My Department took measures to ensure that all remaining semen that was identified in this communication has been dealt with in accordance with the instruction issued by the Commission.  Not all of the semen present in centres in Ireland originating in New Zealand has been affected by this instruction — some semen (e.g. semen imported prior to 9th March 2004) is available for trade.  My Department is in ongoing communication with the relevant New Zealand authorities as to the health status of all of the detained semen.  The information received to date indicates the risk of spread of IBR through the detained semen (semen imported after 9th March 2004) is negligible.

My officials will now liaise with the parties and hopefully resolve the title issues in the near future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	920	I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 219 together.The role of the Educational Disadvantage Committee is to advise on policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage.My Department wrote to the education and social partners seeking their views on the composition and future work of the committee. Following on full consideration of these views, the members of the new committee will be appointed as provided for under section 32 of the Education Act, 1998.Under section 32 (3) of the Act, up to half of the membership of the committee shall be appointed from nominees of such voluntary and other bodies which have objects that are considered relevant to the work of the committee.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	921	Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the Board of Management of each individual school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment by schools.Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a Board of Management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.I have been informed by the NEWB that the mother applied for Home Education Assessment which was carried out in November 2006. The child was then registered as being in receipt of Home Education. Following on from this the mother subsequently contacted the NEWB with regard to finding a school place for her child and an Educational Welfare Officer will assist her with sourcing a suitable placement in a school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	922	All post-primary schools receive ex-quota hours from my Department for the provision of a guidance and counselling service to students.  The service is delivered in the majority of schools by guidance counsellors who are qualified to provide counselling support to students.    Schools can also use additional resources provided by my Department under various initiatives to buy in the services of a qualified counsellor/psychotherapist if they consider this necessary to meet students' needs.  For example, schools participating in Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS), the School Completion Programme and the Guidance Enhancement Initiative (GEI) can, and do, use some of the resources received under these initiatives to buy in counselling services.In cases where a student requires support of a specialist nature, guidance counsellors should arrange a referral to an appropriate outside agency.  Procedures for the referral of students to an outside agency should be included in the school plan of each post-primary school.  Guidance counsellors can consult with an assigned psychologist from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) with regard to individual cases, especially in relation to referral to an outside agency.In the event of a critical incident, psychologists from NEPS are available to meet with individuals or groups of students over a short period of time.  In some circumstances, psychologists from NEPS can engage with individual students for a number of counselling sessions when pertinent issues arise during a psychological assessment.My Department provides funding to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors (IGC) for a programme of professional supervision for its members.  In its first year, 75% of guidance counsellors participated in this programme which is operated through education centres on a national basis.  Approximately 60 qualified counsellors provide support and advice on a range of counselling and mental health issues to the guidance counsellors who are participating in the programme.  In addition, my Department provides funding to each of the sixteen branches of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors to support the provision of continuous professional development for the members of each branch.

The unit referred to by the Deputy is participating in this scheme.  Resource and staffing issues associated with the scheme are sanctioned directly by my Department.The Deputy will be that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents.  SENOs provide a service to parents of children attending units participating in the pilot scheme to which the Deputy refers by providing information on a range of issues including appropriate educational placements available on completion of a period in the ABA units.

A number of proposals were received by OPW.  A technical assessment of these proposals has been carried out and the report is currently under consideration within my Department.  My Department has, however, reverted to the OPW requesting additional information which will require further consultation with the Local Authority.When a suitable site has been secured the project will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme and the National Development Plan.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	927	The application referred to by the Deputy is one of a large number of applications for the scheme received by the Midland Regional Office of my Department.  These applications are currently being logged and acknowledged.  Once this process is complete, my officials will start the process of assessing and ranking the applications.  In keeping with the requirements of the Dormant Accounts Fund legislation, the assessed applications will be considered by the Inter-Departmental Committee on Educational Disadvantage, who will make recommendations to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Minister Ó Cuív will then submit the list of recommendations to the Government for approval. Funding for approved projects will be channelled through my Department's Vote.I cannot give an exact date of when the list of successful applicants will be announced, however, I hope to be able to make this announcement before the schools break for the summer holidays.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	928	My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes.  One scheme is the 1978/79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary.  This scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are being created.  This scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the Ancillary Services grant.The Ancillary Services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services.  The scheme is flexible in nature, giving Boards of Management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.  The school referred to by the Deputy receives caretaking grant assistance under this scheme.Schools that have the services of a secretary under the 1978/79 scheme, as is the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, the level of Ancillary Services grant per pupil is equivalent to half of the standard rate of grant.There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary schools in recent years. Since 1997 the standard rate of the Ancillary Services grant has increased from €38.09 per pupil to €145.50 per pupil at present.  The level of capitation grant at primary level has increased from €57.14 to €163.58 per pupil in the same period.  These significant increases in the funding of primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of primary schools.

Unfortunately, due to the number of applicants it was not possible to approve all applications received.  It is open to the school authority to re-apply for funding under the Summer Works Scheme for 2008 details of which will be announced later this year.It is also open to the school authority to use its annual Minor Works Grant for the works in question provided it is not required for more urgent works.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	930	I understand that the Office of Public Works, which is charged with procuring accommodation for the programme of decentralisation, has signed a contract in respect of a suitable site in Mullingar which will accommodate the decentralisation of 300 posts in my Department.As I have previously stated, I will keep the feasibility of sending a smaller number of posts to Mullingar in advance of the main decentralisation under review. However, I must do this in the context of the potential impact of an accelerated rate of decentralisation on the business of my Department, particularly as the other element of the decentralisation of my Department, the relocation of 100 posts to Athlone, will happen next year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	931	The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 217 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 206 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is also available on my Department's website and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 8 mainstream class teachers.There will, therefore, be no reduction in the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year as compared to the current school year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	932	Individual school authorities are responsible in the first instance for health and safety issues at schools and it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and to put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the potential risk to the school community.It is open to any school to apply to my Department for additional accommodation to meet its needs. All applications for capital funding are assessed in accordance with the Department's published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which were drawn up following consultation with the education partners. Following this assessment, each application is assigned a band rating.  Progress on individual projects is consistent with that band rating.It is also open to school management, where an immediate need for additional accommodation exists, to apply for the provision of temporary rented accommodation while awaiting the provision of permanent accommodation.  Provision is built into the School Building and modernisation Programme to enable schools address urgent health and safety problems. In this regard, primary schools are given an annual allocation under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to school infrastructure.My Department has invested in a record school building programme which between 2000 and 2006 involved the delivery of over 7,800 projects with an investment of €2.6 billion. The budget for 2007, at over €540m, is the first year of the roll-out of the new NDP which will involve an investment of over €4.5 billion in school buildings over the next 7 years.  This multi-annual funding will enable my Department to continue to take a proactive approach to the provision of modern school accommodation having particular regard to the needs of developing areas.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	933	The Trustees of the school referred to by the Deputy have confirmed their intention to close the school on a phased basis. As the Deputy may be aware, this school is a voluntary secondary school and the decision to withdraw as providers of education is within the remit of the Patron body, that is the Sisters of Mercy.The Department has been informed by the Sisters of Mercy that the phased closure will commence in September 2007 with no intake of first year students and all junior cycle pupils will be given the option of proceeding to the senior cycle including the opportunity to avail of a transition year.The Deputy should note that the existing site and school buildings are not in the ownership of the Department. The Trustees have recently reaffirmed to the Department that the current site will not be available for the provision of post-primary education once the school closes.Having considered the immediate implications of the decision by the Sisters of Mercy, I can confirm that the Department will facilitate the enrolment in the neighbouring Community School of students from the area in question by amending the existing catchment area to allow girls from the Kinvara area attend Gort Community School.

The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy indicate that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2005 was 100 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0023/2006), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2006/07 school year is a Principal and 3 mainstream class teachers.According to data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school, the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 115 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which will be issued to all primary schools shortly, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year will be a Principal and 4 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year.  Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  They are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.  Hard copies of this circular will issue to primary schools as soon as possible.It is proposed that the first meeting of the Appeal Board will be held on 22 May, 2007.  Further meetings will be held in July and October, 2007.  The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 11 May, 22 June and 12 October respectively.  Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made.  The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website.The Appeal Board operates independently of the Minister and my Department and its decision is final.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent Appeal Board.The school to which the Deputy refers has an application for additional accommodation with the Department.  The project will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.  The Department is not currently expending any finances on rented accommodation at the school.

A site visit has been arranged with the VEC and school authorities to inform the final brief for the project.  On completion of the brief, the progression of the project will be considered further in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.Drumshambo Vocational School has been invited to participate in the 2007 Permanent Accommodation Scheme to provide additional accommodation at the school.  This Scheme allows schools to proceed with small scale permanent building projects with minimum interaction with the Department.The proposed extension project at Carrigallen Vocational School has been assessed and assigned a band rating in accordance with the revised prioritisation criteria.  The progression of this project will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.Carrigallen Vocational School also submitted an application under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme 2007 for additional accommodation.  On 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under this Scheme.  Due to the volume of applications received in the Department it was not possible to allocate funding to all proposed projects and the school referred to by the Deputy was not successful in this instance.

These generally comprise Irish committees which are set-up as sub-committees of the governing body or which report directly to the university President.Universities are autonomous institutions and I have no function in relation to their day today operational affairs. Decisions on programme provision are made by the universities themselves.  The provision of Irish studies in the university sector remains extensive. This includes a broad range of Irish language studies in UCD and a range of Irish studies qualifications in Trinity College, including an undergraduate honours degree in Early and Modern Irish.  Other examples include programmes provided through the Department of Early and Medieval Irish in UCC and the very extensive range of Irish studies provided in NUI Galway.  Funding, amounting to €1.17 million in 2006, is provided to the universities, colleges of education and NCAD under the Irish Strategic Initiative, managed by the Higher Education Authority. The fund aims to support the teaching of subjects, other than Irish, through the medium of Irish and the development of the use of Irish by both students and staff on the university campus. This fund is distinct from the core funding provided to Universities at undergraduate and postgraduate level. Institutions are required to report to the Authority annually on the activities supported under the Initiative.

While my Department has no involvement in the actual operation of this service, it does make a grant available to each Local Authority on an annual basis to enable Local Authority Librarians select, purchase, and deliver books to the primary schools in its area. The grant is based on the number of pupils enrolled in primary schools in each Local Authority area. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the estimates provision in respect of library grants has been increased from €1.5 million in 2004 to €2.118 million in 2007, an increase of more then 40% since 2004.School managements may also use their normal school budgets for the stocking of school libraries.On 17 January last my Department invited applications under the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) and RAPID Leverage Fund — Small Scale Capital Grant Scheme for Schools. A total of €18 million has been made available to my Department from these funds for approved projects that aim to counteract educational disadvantage. The scheme will provide capital grants for both the enhancement of existing and the provision of new outdoor play areas, school libraries, dining areas and parent rooms. Eligible schools include schools participating in DEIS, schools in or serving RAPID areas and Special Schools.Having regard to the school libraries measure of the scheme, it is primarily to provide for the enhancement of school library facilities via either the upgrading of existing library facilities or the development of new school library facilities. Eligible activities include the provision of library stock, ICT equipment, fixtures and fittings and the construction and fit out of a new school library. Priority will be given to projects that enhance existing facilities rather than the construction of new facilities.In general in newly developing areas the School Planning Section of my Department is working proactively with local authorities to explore the possibility of the development of school provision in tandem with the development of community facilities. This enhanced cooperation has the effect of providing local communities with new schools with enhanced community facilities.My Department recently entered into a partnership approach with Fingal County Council whereby the Council will identify and acquire appropriate sites where schools with enhanced sporting, community and arts facilities will be built to the benefit of both the school and the wider community. It is hoped that this agreement will help to fast-track the delivery of schools and community facilities throughout Fingal.A further example is in the case of the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) at Adamstown, Lucan where the Department is working closely with South Dublin County Council and the developers to produce an integrated solution to education and community facilities that matches the delivery of new housing. Under the SDZ arrangements there is a requirement that schools are in position ahead of or in line with demand.

The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for children with autism, is through the primary and post primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, in special classes or in special schools, a view that is supported by the findings of the Task Force Report on Autism.My Department, through the home tuition scheme facilitates tuition for children with autism awaiting a suitable educational placement and early education intervention for pre-school children with autism by providing funding to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home.The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with Autistic Spectrum Disorders, receive an education appropriate to their needs, preferably through the primary and post-primary school network.  In this regard my Department has established: 182 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools; 5 special Classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome; 18 pre-school classes to facilitate the demand for early intervention provision for children on the autistic spectrum; and 14 Stand Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology on a pilot basis (2 of these facilities have yet to be established).

The Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  The package includes special nationally agreed rates of remuneration for teachers and special needs assistants involved in the July Programme.  Participating schools also receive a special rate of capitation funding in respect of pupils participating in the programme.  Funding is also available to facilitate the provision of school transport and escort services for the children.All relevant schools are encouraged to participate in this initiative in the interest of the children in question.  If schools are not participating in the July Education Programme, home tuition is offered as an alternative for the pupils who would normally attend such schools.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the programme is currently being reviewed and all proposals will be considered in this context.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	953	It can happen in a small number of rapidly developing areas that a traditional patron is not readily available. In view of same, I announced on the 17 February 2007, that a new additional model of Primary school patronage would be introduced on a pilot basis at a school to be built in Diswellstown, Co Dublin. This model will provide an additional patronage option and is not intended to serve as a replacement of the existing patron models.Following on from my recent announcement to introduce a new additional model of primary school patronage on a pilot basis, I have decided as a matter of policy that no vocational education committee (with the exception of the aforementioned pilot community primary school project) shall act as a patron in respect of a primary school or otherwise, establish or maintain a primary school until further notice.Therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred under section 14 of the Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001, I have directed VECs not to establish or maintain primary schools and not to seek recognition of primary schools or recognition as Patrons pursuant to the provisions of the Education Act 1998 until further notice or direction. Vocational Education Committees were advised of same by the Department on 7 March 2007.The Department will begin a process of consultation with the relevant education partners to explore the detailed implementation measures that will be needed to be put in place prior to the opening of the proposed new school.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	955	I propose to take Questions Nos. 255 and 256 together.The most recently established town council is Leixlip, in 1988, under the Towns Improvement Ireland Act 1854. The 1854 Act has since been repealed.Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001, not yet commenced, provides that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council.  Under the relevant provisions of the Act, a proposal to establish a town council, and the timing of any such proposal, is a matter for the local community in the first instance, with a decision on such a proposal being a reserved function of the relevant county council, following a public consultation process.I am continuing to keep the commencement of the relevant sections of the 2001 Act under review, while consolidating progress on quality customer service measures, with the aim of ensuring good accessible local government service delivery for all towns.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	956	In May 2005, I introduced a new initiative for the provision of skateboard facilities by local authorities.  Each City and County Council was invited to submit expressions of interest for grant assistance towards the provision of a skateboard park in its area.  Applications were assessed in my Department in conjunction with the National Children's Office and some 21 projects in 21 different local authority areas were recommended for grant aid.     I approved all those projects in November 2005 and increased the funding allocation to over €2 million which is expected to be spent over the two year period 2006 and 2007.My Department has allocated a grant of €125,000 under the scheme to Limerick City Council. This is to meet 100% of the cost of the project as estimated by the Council, who have not represented to my Department that the grant is insufficient.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	958	Information on the quality of drinking water supplies is regularly compiled and provided by the Environmental Protection Agency. The latest relevant EPA report The Quality of Drinking Water in Ireland — A Report for the Year 2005 is available in the Oireachtas Library.Management of public drinking water supplies is generally the responsibility of the local authorities which have a range of instruments and measures available to them to meet anticipated needs and to ensure quality standards. Any investigations or remedial measures relating to water quality in the schemes referred are matters for Galway City and County Councils.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	960	The maintenance and improvement of public roads, including modifications to associated public footpaths, would normally be a matter for the relevant roads authority and not for private householders.Works relating to private roads or footpaths, or to public footpaths in the context of private development, in principle require planning permission. Certain classes of development are however exempted from the requirement of planning permission. These exemptions were revised and updated in the Planning and Development Regulations 2001(S.I. 600 of 2001).Under class 6, schedule 2, Part 1 of the 2001 Regulations, the provision of a hard surface within the curtilage of a house is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission, subject to certain conditions.   However, this exemption would not extend to the dishing of the pavement for access to the property, or the widening of a gateway. Given the potential implications of such works for road safety, neighbouring properties or the appearance of a street, the requirements of the current Regulations, which have been endorsed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, are considered reasonable and appropriate.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-03-29 00:00:00	Prelude	961	Under the Habitats Regulations 1997, a landowner may seek review of a designation of land as a proposed Special Area of Conservation (pSAC) or as a proposed Special Protection Areas (pSPAs) by making an objection in writing, and based on scientific grounds, to my Department along with a clear map of the land in question. The Regulations provide that such objections must be made within a three-month period of the site being notified.My Department has received some 679 objections to designation of land for nature conservation since 1 November 2006. Some 596 of these relate to candidate Special Areas of Conservation (cSACs) designated under the Habitats Directive; 72 relate to designated under the Birds Directive and 11 to Natural Heritage Areas designated under the Wildlife Act.Following receipt, each objection is given an initial review by my Department.  The internal review generally takes six to eight weeks following receipt of a decision.  Any person who is not satisfied with the result of that initial consideration may appeal within 3 weeks on scientific grounds to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board.Each appellant to the Appeals Advisory Board has six weeks from the time of their appeal to produce a scientific report to ground the appeal; my Department must prepare a report in response.   The case is then scheduled for prompt consideration by the Board.My Department's priority is to ensure that, in line with the Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, the Appeals Board operates within a clear timeframe.  I am also anxious to ensure that the current appeals are dealt with as expeditiously as possible as part of national efforts to conclude the designation process under the Habitats Directive.  To that end, additional resources have been provided to the Appeals Advisory Board to ensure that its decisions are given promptly.
