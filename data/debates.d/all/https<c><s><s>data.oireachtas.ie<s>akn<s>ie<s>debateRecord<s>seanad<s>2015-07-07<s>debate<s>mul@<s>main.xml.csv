#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	0	I have notice from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames that, on the motion for the Commencement of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Skills to facilitate the continuation of restricted recognition for graduates in Montessori education, as currently allowed under regulation 3 of the Teaching Council Acts. I have also received notice from Senator Sean D. Barrett of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to build on the welcome work of the Government economic and evaluation service in order that its research and evaluations can directly assist the Oireachtas in the evaluation of public policy options.  I have also received notice from Senator Paul Bradford of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Finance to outline the Irish Government’s response to the Greek referendum result. I have also received notice from Senator Michael Comiskey of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to extend the availability of places on the green cert course in County Leitrim in view of the fact that 150 farmers are applying to take this course although only 30 places are available and that the green cert must be completed by farmers by October 2016 to be eligible for farm payments. I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Healy Eames, Barrett and Bradford, and they will be taken now. Senator Comiskey has withdrawn his matter.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	1	Is trua nach bhfuil an tAire Oideachais agus Scileanna anseo ach cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, Deputy Joe McHugh. I tabled this matter to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to facilitate the continuation of restricted recognition for graduates in Montessori education, as currently permitted under regulation 3 of the Teaching Council Acts. This affects approximately 100 graduates per year between St. Nicholas Montessori College and Cork Institute of Technology. As the regulation has been in place since 2005, up to 1,000 of these graduates have level 8 degrees. Graduates with level 8 qualifications in Montessori education are currently afforded restricted recognition. They may be appointed to teaching positions in special education settings in primary schools and special schools. The numbers registering under this provision amount to 1% of annual registrants, or approximately 110 teachers. If the proposed removal of regulation 3 is allowed they will not be able to secure any form of recognition from the Teaching Council because in the absence of a Teaching Council registration number, a graduate with a four-year, level 8 degree cannot be appointed to a primary school or a special school. These graduates are in the Minister of State's county of Donegal as well as my county of Galway. The Department of Education and Skills will not pay any person in a teaching capacity who does not have a Teaching Council registration number. I understand the Teaching Council is advising the Minister to sign an order that will withdraw registration for these Montessori teaching graduates.If the proposed removal of regulation 3 is allowed, the only current role within the education setting available to level 8 graduates would then be as special needs assistants. There is a big difference between being a teacher and being a special needs assistant in a special school. As the Minister of State knows that is in a particular care setting. The opportunity for Montessori graduates to practise the pedagogical foundations acquired under the four years of higher education could not then be exercised. It is an appalling vista for people who have invested in a four-year degree. Furthermore, it is a downgrading of early years education and the Minister should not do this. Graduates and providers of level 8 Montessori programmes are seeking the retention of the existing registration process. In other words they want it left alone. The Montessori pedagogy is recognised as having a unique role in assisting children with special needs. The 141 special schools would bear the brunt of this decision if it proceeds, which is fairly serious. The children would lose access to teaching resources, human resources with a set of skills designed to assist their personal and educational development. I recently met a qualified second level teacher who has Teaching Council registration. However, it was her Montessori qualification that gave her an opportunity to get a particular role working with three children with extreme needs. Research by Banks et al. in 2014 suggests that up to 25% of children in the educational system have special educational needs. While the spectrum of the resources to address their needs will vary, statistics available from the NCSE and the Department of Education and Skills confirm that over recent years the allocation of resources has increased by an average of 6.5% annually. Importantly there has been no evidence that the low-entry requirement, which is often cited as a basis for differentiation for Montessori graduates, has impacted on the quality of the provision for pupils with special educational needs - if anything it has improved them. The Minister has made a very strong commitment to the early years sector, which has been backed up by very positive action. Montessori graduates want to play their part in helping the Minister to realise her vision. However, if the Teaching Council proposal is allowed to proceed in its current format, it will send a message to those teachers and educators in early years settings that they are not part of the education profession. Rather than building on her initiative it will detract and demotivate the very persons we rely on for the continuum of education from birth to six years and into the special needs sector as well. Knowing the Minister's commitment to early years education, the Minister should not be the Minister to sign off on this regulation. The required amendments allow for the implementation of Part 5 of the Teaching Council Acts 2001 to 2012 to proceed without abolishing the current provision under regulation 3. I accept the role of the Teaching Council inter alia is to provide advice and guidance to the Minister, but in this instance the Minister has the authority to reject this. I am asking the Minister of State to convey this concern to the Minister for Education and Skills so that the qualifications and standing of our Montessori teachers, who have restricted access and restricted recognition to teach in our primary schools in special education and the early years setting, are not affected.

Ba mhaith liom mo mhíle buíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir arís. I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the topic. As the Senator may be aware, the Teaching Council is the independent statutory regulator for the teaching profession. The council sets standards for all elements of the continuum of teacher education including initial teacher education programmes, induction and continuous professional development. The Teaching Council's regulations for the registration of teachers were first published in 2009 and set out the standards that teachers must meet if they wish to be registered members of the profession in Ireland.Regulation 3, covering special educational needs and Montessori, was put in place in accordance with the relevant circulars issued by the Department prior to the council's establishment in 2006, whereby such teachers are eligible for employment in restricted school settings, that is, in certain categories of special schools and in certain classes in mainstream schools where Irish is not a curricular requirement. The council has been engaged in a review of the regulations for some time, and has consulted with a number of stakeholders, including a provider of Montessori teacher education. The review has been necessitated by the extension and reconceptualisation of all programmes of initial teacher education. New regulations will also be necessary in light of the Bill to amend the Teaching Council Acts that is currently completing its passage through the Houses. The developments are part of a significant programme of reform of teacher education in which the council has been engaged in recent years, informed in part by the Department's literacy and numeracy strategy of 2011. It is important to remember that the primary focus of the reform programme is to enhance the quality of teaching and learning experience for all children and young people. In any discussions we have about teaching and learning, including inclusive education, the learner must be the focus. As the statutory professional standards body for teaching in Ireland, the Teaching Council is of the view that all teachers should be first and foremost qualified and registered as teachers in their given sector whether primary or post-primary, before they specialise in particular areas of teaching and learning. Special education needs, SEN, is now mandatory in all programmes of initial teacher education under the council's criteria and guidelines, so the landscape has evolved significantly since regulation 3 was put in place. That said, the council itself acknowledges that no one phase of teachers' learning will be sufficient to address all the needs of the pupils they will teach throughout their careers. The very concepts of continuous professional development, CPD, and the draft national framework for teachers' learning, Cosán, bear that out. Specialist provision will continue to have its place in teachers' learning. Once teachers are fully qualified and registered, it is hoped they will continue to have a keen interest in finding quality programmes that will enable and empower them to adapt their practice to the needs of children in their care. Recent changes in the teacher education landscape have been designed to ensure that inclusive education, incorporating the education of learners with special education needs, is given the appropriate professional space and time. In summary, the advice of the council that regulation 3 is no longer required has been accepted. I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.

I urge her not to do so. I accept that the Teaching Council is very busy. At times, I am in close contact with the Teaching Council and it has said it has no interest in early years graduates. It does not acknowledge the very specific pedagogy that Maria Montessori afforded us all, and that has informed teacher education formation for all. What impresses me about Montessori graduates is that they have very specific hands-on knowledge of how to work with children in special educational needs settings. I was a teacher educator and I know how squashed the programmes are. While I am pleased that special needs education is a part of all programmes, I do not believe any current teacher education programme has an adequate focus on special education and the range and complexity of needs facing teachers in the classroom. I urge the Minister to consider the matter again. I appreciate that it is not the Minister of State's brief. Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh, for the time. Does the Minister of State agree with the two-tier approach that is emerging between the 1,000 graduates that have gone through the system that had restricted recognition afforded to them and the new students who are in the system who will not be given any? Another form of discrimination is emerging. Does the Minister of State agree with that?

Senator Healy Eames is a former teacher and I am a former secondary schoolteacher. I worked in St. Mark's in Tallaght in 1992 and in the Loreto school in Letterkenny in 1993. The situation has changed dramatically since then. The focus is more pupil-centred. I accept there are challenges, especially in terms of the experience of Montessori teachers and the valuable input they have.My job today is to take back the Senator's message to the Minister and I certainly will do that.

I have tabled this matter because the work of the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service is most valuable. It is an essential part of the work being done by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Harris. It is the expenditure equivalent of the work the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council does on the tax side. It is vital that public money is not spent on expenditures that are ineffective and that do not create a flow of benefits that exceed the costs and it is not desirable to have expenditures which add to the national debt problem. The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service has a seven-member oversight committee and I commend them. They include Professors Dave Madden and Kevin Denny of UCD, as well as Professor Frances Ruane. The chair is Ms Deirdre Hanlon, assistant secretary at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. There also is a 15-member management group. They have a strong view that the service needs to extend its work to include the Departments of Education and Skills and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and they want those Departments to join in the Government Economic and Evaluation Service by the end of 2015. I would say, "Why not today?" That is approximately €9 billion of expenditure, out of €53 billion overall or 18%, that is not covered by this valuable work that we all must do. The first set of graduates recruited will have joined by the first quarter of this year. They have masters degrees and the object is a programme of continuous professional development to assist both the Government and the Oireachtas in providing an evaluation service. The constitutional officer to oversee value for money is the Comptroller and Auditor General and perhaps this new body should liaise with him because sometimes the Comptroller and Auditor General only turns up after the mishap has happened. Members need to have early warnings, as events such as the banking crisis illustrate for them. Moreover, there are parallels, such as the Congressional Budget Office in the United States and so on. The problem with this evaluation exercise is it undoubtedly will have powerful enemies. Lobby groups, not just bankers, think they have the right to Exchequer funds, notoriously on 29 September 2008. There are also enemies within as described in the work of the US economist, William Niskanen, whereby in many bureaucracies, promotion depends on expanding the budget and therefore, they maximise the budget rather than even asking the question as to whether those budgets led to any useful outputs. More cost-benefit analyses and more studies are needed in advance. There have been three cases of late about which I am worried. A single page was all that appeared in the Oireachtas Library about the sale of Aer Lingus. While I expressed strong views on the other point of view regarding the sale of the Government's stake, this is inadequate. In addition, I raised at the relevant Oireachtas committee last week the issue of postcodes, involving €27 million for a seven-digit non-sequential address for every house in the country but I note the time the President had to consider such a proposal, on which I have seen no cost-benefit analysis, was reduced when the Government invoked Article 25.2 2° of the Constitution to require that legislation to be signed on a date earlier than the fifth day after the Bill was presented to the President. The third case that has arisen in the transport committee, which I believe also affects the Minister of State's part of the country and it concerns the question of whether it is the correct solution to generate electricity for Northern Ireland within that territory, for example, in Derry or in Larne or is it correct to generate it in the South? How much does one lose if the transmission is overhead on pylons or underground? I believe that numbers in this regard would help. This is a message that is of use to evaluation. We should have a lot more of it as it is valuable and this House will always support progress towards better evaluation of public expenditure. All knowledge that can help the better governance of Ireland should be promoted. Moves in that regard certainly would have the support of this House. This is why I asked for this item to be considered. The initiative is important, will have powerful enemies and people will try to avoid it but it is in the interests of Parliament and, as the Government has stated, it is in its own interest to have full evaluations and full discussion. The recruitment of all these young people with those qualifications and the involvement of the senior academics is most welcome and I wish the initiative well.

Gabhaim míle buíochas leis. I thank Senator Barrett for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who is not available this afternoon due to Government business. The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, was established in 2012. The introduction of the new service was part of the broader expenditure reform agenda launched by the Minister, Deputy Howlin. It is an integrated cross-Government service to enhance the role of economics and value-for-money analysis in policy making and demonstrates a strong commitment to a high and consistent standard of policy evaluation and policy analysis throughout the Civil Service. The purpose of IGEES is to enhance the evaluation and economic capacity of the Civil Service. Its first objective is to develop a professional service that will provide good quality analysis to assist Government, its second objective is that it aims to support better policy design and its third objective is that it works towards more open policy dialogue with expert stakeholders. IGEES is spread across the central government sector. It operates within a large number of Government Departments, each of which has specific units or sections that are focused on economic and/or evaluation work. In some Departments, evaluation or economic units were already in place prior to the establishment of IGEES. These have typically either been expanded or are planned to be expanded as part of developing the new service. In other Departments, new units have been set up. Building on existing specialised expertise in Government Departments, there have already been three successful recruitment campaigns since 2012 to augment this capacity. There will also be annual recruitment campaigns to sustain and develop the service. These intakes of qualified economists and evaluators will help ensure the service meets its long-term objectives. There are now approximately 90 IGEES members working across the Civil Service. IGEES members work on core areas of government, including the budget and macroeconomic forecasting. IGEES members developed the public spending code - the value-for-money standards for public expenditure - and are actively involved in promoting the code. IGEES units in Departments across the Civil Service are already delivering a range of analytical and statistical outputs. The entire range of different analyses is published by individual Departments and also on the IGEES website at http://igees.gov.ie. These analyses include: programme evaluations: cross-cutting reviews: economic analysis: tax expenditure reviews; and sectoral trend analysis. Some examples of recently published papers include: A Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport - Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport; A Fact Sheet on Irish Agriculture - Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Behavioural Economics - Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; Expenditure Implications of Demographic Change in the Primary and Post-Primary Sectors - Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Departments which are involved in IGEES follow shared approaches to recruitment, promotion and mobility for their IGEES staff. Under the leadership of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, they have also jointly developed a standardised professional development framework and a strong programme of training and development opportunities. In addition, the IGEES network and annual conference provide important opportunities for members to present and discuss their work with colleagues from other Government Departments, as well as academics and specialists. IGEES is particularly important to support programme evaluation across the Civil Service. The growing capacity of IGEES will play a central role in delivering a new series of expenditure evaluations under the value-for-money review initiative as the previous round comes to a close. The initiative is a long-standing feature of the evaluation landscape in Ireland. It requires Departments to systematically examine and review spending programmes to ensure that they are working efficiently and effectively. The overall objective of the reviews is to inform spending decisions. Value-for-money reviews are regularly published by Departments and laid before the Oireachtas. During the next three years, a new programme of reviews covering well over 30 different programme areas will be carried out. The results of these reviews will help underpin the next comprehensive review of expenditure. The recent such review built on the work of IGEES staff across Departments and in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A range of background analyses and papers that were undertaken by IGEES as part of that review were published. The output of IGEES is available to inform policy makers, public debate and Parliament. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, introduced the whole-of-year budgetary process so that the Oireachtas could engage in constructive dialogue with Ministers and their officials about spending plans and priorities. To do this, it is important that the Oireachtas has timely, coherent and relevant information. A significant volume of information has been made available to committees through the performance budgeting initiative. In addition, the range of evaluations undertaken and published by Departments, often using their IGEES resources, provides further evidence to help the Oireachtas assess public policy options.

The open policy dialogue he mentioned is a credit to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his Department. It is also vitally necessary that it is not in any way subverted by people with favourite projects who try to get them through without evaluation. It is more welcome that the skills deficits noted in the Wright report are being addressed. I hope these new evaluation experts will be fully incorporated into the public service. It is the kind of expertise we need and it is part of the reforms we all came into the House in 2011 to implement. It is good to hear about the progress that is being made. The Minister will have support for that momentum on this side of the House. It is important and valuable work and this House will not be found wanting because it is essential that we never drift back to where we were between 2005 and 2008. It is important that every item of public expenditure is fully accounted for and value for money is assured to taxpayers.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	15	It is important to keep this conversation going but I would like to acknowledge that every Department has bought into, and is contributing to, this process and there is an input. We always have to be conscious that it is a three-way conversation between the citizens, the Legislature and the experts. When I was a Member of this House in 2005, I quoted my father who said: "If we do not watch what is going on this country whereby people are paying up to €600,000 for two-bedroom apartments, they will have millstones around their necks for the rest of their lives." We have to be conscious of the fact that this House has a role and there should be better trigger mechanisms. We have a second arm of the Legislature here and there should be trigger mechanisms when a politician raises a point in this House in order that it is followed through. I recall making that point at the time and that was as far as it went. I appreciate the Senator's contribution. I am a big advocate of the man on the street and he was talking about a property bubble bursting and crashing long before it became trendy within the appropriate field of expertise.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	16	I welcome the Minister of State and I am glad he is an advocate of the man and woman on the street and his or her views. I wonder what are the views of the man on the street in Athens today following Sunday's referendum. I debated this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Harris, in the House last week, and while neither of us put our political prediction hats on, both of us deep down suspected that the Greek people would see fit to come round to the conventional world view of Greece and vote "Yes", but they surprised us and much of the EU and took a democratic decision to vote "No". It is not a decision we may have desired but that was the result of the referendum. As we speak, much bigger and more serious and senior discussions are taking place elsewhere between eurozone finance Ministers and eurozone leaders and, hopefully, during the next few hours and days, a solution will be put together to allow Greece to remain in the eurozone and to allow the ongoing work of the European project to continue. It would be a complete and utter economic and political disaster for the eurozone and the EU itself if Greece was forced out of the eurozone. I would be the first to concede that the management of the Greek economy by previous Greek Governments left much to be desired. The current Greek Government, having been swept to power on a wave of euphoria, dreams and promises a few months ago, has also taken unhelpful economic action. Hopefully however, arising from what it believes to be a mandate from its referendum on Sunday, it might see common sense. The Irish Government and other governments in the eurozone, as well as in the broader European Union, must be seen to work with and for a Greek solution. It may be necessary to swallow some political pride. We all know the reality of the politics of the situation. Certain countries do not want to see a win for Syriza. As a political "saddo" who watches all parties’ Ard-Fheiseanna, I was not impressed to see the now Greek finance Minister speak at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis several months ago, highlighting the links and similarities between Sinn Féin’s and Syriza's policies. That is politics but we must move beyond this to ensure the misery faced by the people of Greece is dealt with. Wild promises continued to be made right up until the last moment of the referendum campaign. The outgoing finance Minister said that, regardless of the referendum result, the Greek banks would be open on the following Monday and Tuesday and a solution found within 48 hours. Again, that was being overly optimistic. It is essential, however, we park the politics and look at the bigger picture to devise a workable solution. From an Irish perspective, rather than following we should be leading. There was a time when Irish foreign policy had a strong moral dimension to it. It was one in which Ireland felt obliged, because of our colonial history, to side with the underdog, forming alliances with smaller nations. It appears now, however, that in the European Union, and in particular the eurozone, we take our leads not from the smaller countries but the more powerful. We need to work with all of our colleagues on the European stage, large and small. Not only is there an opportunity but there is an obligation on us to be one of the countries advocating for concessions towards Greece. The Minister of State can argue about the cost to Ireland. However, what will be the cost to Ireland if Greece does exit the eurozone? What is the cost if it has a contagion effect on our nearest neighbour, the UK, and impacts on its forthcoming European referendum? We must not just be thinking in the political short term but look towards the medium and long-term necessity of keeping the eurozone strong. I appreciate there are evolving negotiations taking place on the whole issue. What is the Government’s current thinking on the matter?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	17	I thank Senator Bradford for putting down this matter, which is evolving as we speak. He has given a broad and holistic view on this important issue. Greece remains a full member of the euro area and it is in all our interests that it remains so. However, as the Government has stated on many occasions, as a member of the euro area, each member state has responsibilities and obligations. This is no different for Greece. The referendum in Greece on Sunday, 5 July resulted in a majority “No” vote, which was a rejection of the prior action list as it stood on 25 June. It should be noted this list was not a final list as the Greek authorities unilaterally withdrew from negotiations before agreement could be reached.While there were still divergences, there was considerable commonality to bridge the gap and agree a single document that all parties could sign up to. The institutions had come forward with a very favourable offer to Greece and would have also addressed future financing needs and the sustainability of the Greek debt, although this had not been discussed or agreed by the Eurogroup. It also included support for a Commission-led package for a new start for jobs and growth and would boost recovery of investment in the real economy. Greece withdrew from the negotiations and called a referendum. As of midnight on 30 June, the second economic adjustment programme for Greece expired along with associated disbursements. Therefore any further financing for Greece would likely be under a new programme with associated conditionality. Today, the finance Ministers of the euro area will meet to take stock of developments, listen to the new Greek finance Minister and try to find a way forward. This will be followed by a meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the euro area, the euro summit, in which the Taoiseach will participate. The ball is now in the Greek court. For recovery of the Greek economy to occur, difficult measures and reforms are inevitable. There is no getting away from this. It is important that the Greek authorities put forward reform measures that will put the Greek economy back on a sustainable path. Ireland is, of course, open to a new programme for Greece, but any programme must be backed by a full memorandum of understanding and a commitment to strong ownership and implementation. Time is running out, as is evident from the extremely difficult situation the Greek banks are facing. While the governing council of the ECB maintained the level of emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, at just under €90 billion, it decided to adjust the haircuts on collateral accepted by the bank. We have great sympathy for the Greek people and the Minister for Finance has expressed this view on several occasions. He has also been quite helpful to the Greek authorities in moving to the position whereby realistic negotiations were taking place prior to the referendum and stands ready to further these efforts with the new finance Minister. Ireland, together with the other member states, understands and empathises with the difficult situation faced by the Greek people which has been exacerbated by the expiry of the second programme and the current uncertainty created by the referendum. This is why there is still a willingness to negotiate a way forward which takes account of the realities of the situation in Greece and the political priorities of its new Government. We have engaged as quickly as possible. It is now up to the Greek authorities to come up with a credible plan which will undo the damage created by this uncertainty and put Greece on a sustainable path of growth.

The Minister of State said that the ball is now in the Greek court. The ball is in the courts of all the eurozone countries and with their leaders. We know from our history, and for geographical reasons the Minister of State knows this better than I, that when big decisions must be made and compromises found, movement is required on both sides and previously entrenched views and positions must be set aside. That is why saying the ball is in the Greek court is not sufficient. There must be movement, compromise and new, fresh thinking on all our parts if a solution is to be found. I hope Ireland is leading the charge in seeking those compromises and that new thinking.

I have been learning Irish in the past year. There is an old Irish saying that is valid in this debate, ní neart go cur le chéile, there is no strength without unity. We want Greece to be part of the eurozone and we want that strength in unity. When we are using language, we should go back to our first language and maybe we are better at articulating the Irish language - ní neart go cur le chéile. I hope a resolution is found and that there is a meeting of minds on all sides to try to forge some way of moving this major difficulty out of the space it is in.

We have issued a revised version of that motion and I encourage all Members interested in this matter to put their names to it in order that a clear message from the Seanad can go out that this is important and that we believe that people who are waiting for pancreas transplants are important. By way of further information for Members, 15 pancreas donations went to waste this year thus far because we did not have a surgeon in place and the vacancy has not been filled. I have received this information from the retired professor and surgeon, David Hickey. Those 15 pancreas donations could have been used in life-changing and life-saving operations but they were not used because we do not have the facilities or the surgeon to carry out that life-saving surgery. I do not think anyone thinks this is acceptable. If people are interested in this matter I ask them to put their names to the motion by 5 p.m. today. I intend to move the motion tomorrow, I hope with the full agreement of the House. On other health issues, I refer to the figures for the record number of people waiting on trolleys. The numbers of people on outpatient waiting lists increased by over 200% and there has been a 400% increase in St. Vincent's hospital in Dublin. It is gone past a crisis. The Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, will be in the House next week but there are very many issues that are not being addressed. I refer to the frustration of people who cannot get appointments. People are on trolleys and outpatient appointments are being cancelled. It has gone from bad to worse and worse again. We need to have a specific debate before the summer recess to give the Minister an opportunity to outline his plans for addressing this crisis. All we get from the Minister is tea and sympathy. He says it is terrible and I agree with him but what is he doing about it? That is the problem. I do not see anything happening. I have further referenced the point with regard to the Fampyra drug, an issue I have raised in the House time and again for more than a year. Three thousand multiple sclerosis patients who would benefit from this mobility drug cannot get the drug. It is as simple as that. They cannot get it because of inaction by the Department and by the Minister.I have raised the matter time and again and the Leader has used his good offices to raise the point with the Minister, but nothing is happening. I raised it in February 2014. People I know of in my area and all over the country can no longer work. They no longer have mobility, are dependent on the State and cannot access a life-changing drug. This is an issue for 3,000 MS patients and it is beyond disgraceful at this stage. There is no logical reason for it. The drugs policy unit can state what it wants, that it is assessing this or that application, but the reality is that people cannot access the drug that was helping them. This is not right and the Minister must address the issue. Therefore, I am again today proposing an amendment on the Order of Business that the Minister come to the House to address specifically the issue to allow 3,000 people to access and benefit from the MS drug, Fampyra.

Also today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, following representations made to him, has issued a statement officially commemorating the genocide from an Irish perspective. This is in keeping with the European Parliament resolution of 2009 which called on the Council and the Commission to commemorate appropriately the anniversary of the genocide and support the recognition of 11 July across the European Union as a day of commemoration of the Srebrenica massacre. I anticipate that next year, to mark the 21st anniversary, we will have more official events taking place to commemorate the genocide. I commend the crew of the LE Eithne who this week are due to finish their tour of duty in the Mediterranean where they have saved the lives of many hundreds of migrants seeking to enter Europe. It is important that we see a proper transnational migration policy adopted across the European Union. I look forward to this happening and ask the Leader for a debate early in the next term on migration policy with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade or the Minister for Justice and Equality. A briefing has just been held for Members interested in discussing the amendments being made to the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, Report Stage of which is to be taken on Thursday at 3 p.m. I know that a number of colleagues have submitted amendments, but there will also be a number of Government amendments to the Bill. Briefing notes are available to anyone who wishes to have them. The Government's amendments have been circulated.

However, it was made very clear by European leaders that they wanted Mr. Varoufakis gone. There is no question or doubt that that is from where the impetus came. There is no vision or leadership in Europe. This is a disaster for the European project. What has happened to the idea of solidarity? I know that it is not fashionable or politically correct to say it, but it is time somebody reminded the Germans that they started two world wars and were penalised heavily through reparations. However, after a number of years, there was a massive debt cancellation, but now they are the ones who will not permit debt cancellation for the Greeks. It is time somebody mentioned their record. The EU negotiators and the principal people involved are anonymous and unelected.I am not sure if the rumours are true but I have it from a fairly well placed source that at least one of them is so drunk by lunchtime that he is incapable of conducting any afternoon meetings.

Among other things, it noted that Galway is one of four national urban areas that has experienced a decreased level of service due to congestion. Anyone who knows Galway would hardly find such a conclusion surprising given the volume of traffic. It also proves there is a need for better public transport and to finalise plans for an outer bypass, as a matter of urgency. I sincerely hope that such a route could proceed as soon as possible. However, if we are to be realistic about this matter, it will take at least five to ten years given the difficulties regarding route selection. As I have stated in the past, and as I shall state here again, in order to tackle traffic congestion in Galway city and the western region it is critical that we have park and ride facilities located east, west and north of Galway city. A bus service must be provided. It would mean people can park their vehicles and use a bus that will travel every ten or 15 minutes at peak times in the mornings and the evening, and to a lesser degree during the day, to bring people to their education centres, places of work or hospitals, all of which are located in the city centre. All reports that have been conducted in Galway city will show that over 90% of people want to travel into the city centre area. Therefore, it is critical that we have an efficient and cost-effective bus service. If we want to develop the western region, and want to promote and develop the local economy, then we need to deal with traffic congestion in the short term while we await longer-term projects.

Let us bear in mind that they expressed their views against a backdrop of austerity which they have already suffered. Even leading up to the referendum, with the difficulty in banks, people still felt strongly and passionately enough about their independence and sovereignty. Also, it would be very wise for us in Ireland not to lecture the people of Greece.

Can one imagine Europe without Greece? I certainly cannot imagine such a scenario. I have no doubt there has been brinkmanship on both sides. Therefore, the best way for the rest of us, who are not immediately and directly involved, is to try to find compromise because at the end of the day the matter will be resolved one way or another, positively or negatively.We should remember that we are a small country. We have our own difficulties. We also have the residue which will be with us for a long time of the austerity measures which people have had to suffer.

I acknowledge that today is the tenth anniversary of the killing of 56 people in London on 7 July 2005. This anniversary is almost in the same week as the horrific events in Tunisia. It behoves us to remember what the word terror means. It means putting fear into the hearts of people. I feel very much for the people of Tunisia who fought very hard for their democracy and now see it fading from them as international tourists abandon Tunisia, which is totally understandable. It is sad to see the democratic regime in Tunisia coming under pressure because of the activities of terrorism. I congratulate FLAC on the launch of its annual report yesterday. I commend it on the excellent work it does and note that it acknowledges that there was an 80% increase in the number of calls coming in to the office as a result of the current crisis in housing, in the rented sector in particular.  Could I ask the Leader that we have a debate on the issue of access to free legal aid, because at the end of the day, it is a person's ability to vindicate his or her rights that is at issue? I think FLAC has put that on the agenda. It behoves us to examine it and see what we are doing as a House to vindicate that right.

We have had the experience in recent times of Berkeley in California but also of Priory Hall and the row of homes in County Kildare that burned down. It seems there are defective buildings likely to be occurring even yet. During the Celtic tiger buildings went up at such speed that I do not think there were controls on them. I understand the Minister is looking at introducing a review of building regulations. I think it would be very useful to have him come to this Chamber so that we would have an opportunity to discuss matters. If somebody buys a house, as many of us have, and ten, 20 or 30 years later we discover it is a defective building, we cannot get in touch with the builder or do anything about it, yet in other countries they have an insurance policy that continues to enable the owner of the home to be able to seek recompense many years later. I think it would be worthwhile if the Minster were to come to this House to give us a chance to discuss the regulations before he introduces them. May I mention one other occasion today? Mrs. Kathleen Hayes Rollins Snavely who died yesterday was 113 years and 140 days old and was born in Feakle in County Clare. To the best of my knowledge she was the oldest Irish person and she died in New York. She was the 16th oldest person in the United States. I am sure that when she was born in 1902 she did not realise she would still be around in 2015 and might be mentioned in an Irish Parliament.

A number of my colleagues were present for the event. I ask, as I have done in the House previously, that some more money be put into Seán Mac Diarmada's residence in County Leitrim. County Leitrim is allocated only €30,000 for the whole celebration and it is not enough. We have been lucky in that money has been allocated by the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht towards a car park at Seán Mac Diarmada's house but much work remains to be done around the house. That area could be transformed by bringing more tourism to the locality. The village of Kiltyclogher, which will be Leitrim's heritage town, will be recognised shortly. This is a great opportunity to promote tourism and encourage more people to the area by spending a little more money. I call on the Minister with responsibility for this area to have another look at the issue with a view to developing Seán Mac Diarmada's house and the village of Kiltyclogher into something which will be of great significance in 2016.

When I looked at the photographs in the newspaper of the Pearse cottage in Galway I thought it was the Mac Diarmada cottage, such is the similarity between the two. Without wishing to appear partisan, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Simon Harris, visited the Mac Diarmada homestead a few weeks ago to launch the annual Leitrim County Council sponsored Seán Mac Diarmada summer school. There was a high level of expectation, especially among Senator Comiskey's party colleagues, that the Minister of State would not leave without making a specific announcement. Not only were those in the Government parties disappointed but all of us who live in Leitrim were disappointed that no such announcement was made about funding. I found it hard to absorb yesterday watching all the media attention on the Taoiseach and all the various foot soldiers in Fine Gael turning up in Connemara for the announcement in terms of the Pádraig Pearse cottage. I do not want to set one cottage against another but, as history has already proved, he was probably the most significant member of the Provisional Government of 1916. We in Leitrim believe that reality should be recognised and recognised financially. In that regard I fully support the comments of Senator Comiskey and call on the Government, even at this late stage, to allocate the necessary funding. Leitrim County Council has plans for its development. The road access is very narrow and funding is required. I am sure it can be found somewhere. I support Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú, Senator Sean D. Barrett and others on all sides, who are calling for a humanitarian approach to what is going on in Greece. There is most definitely an elite between the German-Franco-Finnish-Dutch axis, although I would probably exclude the French in that they seem to be standing in solidarity with the Greek people.

Therefore, if Europe is to mean anything other than just an economic unit which appears to be the agenda of many of the larger and richer countries, that are controlled largely by banking interests and those not interested in the distress and trauma experienced not only the Greek people but others who have suffered from austerity policies in recent years, they are the people who have to be confronted and challenged. There is a moral imperative on the part of all EU countries to ensure the decision of the Greek people is recognised and acknowledged. They do not want further austerity.

While I fully accept the majority of objections are made by private individuals and community groups with real concerns about planning applications, there are a number of body corporates that use the process as a strategic tool to clamp down on competition in their chosen field. I have been informed that there is a company in this country which is a serial objector.

It even says on its website that it opposes unsustainable out-of-town retail development. I fully agree with it on that point, but what about the sustainable retail units and supermarkets being built smack bang in the middle of our town centres which it opposes? The cost of submitting a planning objection is so cheap, at €20 to the local council and €50 to An Bord Pleanála, it makes great commercial sense if one is looking to retain one's market share. The actions of these naysayers, however, are costing towns jobs, not only in the retail sector but also in the construction sector. To turn a blind eye to what is going on right now would be nothing short of negligent. We must continue to highlight the kinds of strokes being pulled. The essence of democracy allows for people to make their concerns known and I want to uphold that right, but it is wrong and worrying that the integrity of the system is being called into question and large companies are abusing the process for their own commercial gain. We need to have a debate on the issue and look at strengthening our planning legislation to ensure it is not left open to abuse. For that reason, I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government would be invited to this House to debate the matter at his earliest convenience.

I did not interrupt anyone on the other side of the House when they were speaking. I commend the people of Greece on the way they have voted. They have showed real courage in voting against what has been described by other Senators in this House as an attempt by the European elites to force upon the Greek Government and people unsustainable debt, poverty and economic changes which simply do not make sense. Any economist worth his or her salt knows there will be a need to restructure the debt in Greece. The European elites are trying to find a political solution, which is concerned with regime change and putting the Greek Government under pressure, rather than finding an economic solution which is obvious to most right-thinking people, namely, ease up on austerity and restructure the debt. Even the IMF, for all people may think of it, has clearly said it wants a restructuring of debt but the Greeks are not being offered that because it is being frustrated by bigger countries such as Germany which simply do not want it to happen. On a separate issue, I call for a debate on the Lansdowne Road agreement. We have not had a debate on that issue in this House. We know ex-taoisigh, ex-Ministers-----

We also know that despite the facade of fairness which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is trying to present as underpinning the Lansdowne Road agreement, higher earners, those with more than €65,000, including Deputies, are in line for a €7,000 pay increase over the next two years. What of those earning less than €65,000? They get crumbs from the table: €1,000. Yet the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform says it is fair. It is not fair. I am calling for a debate on the unfairness of both those agreements and their impact on the vast majority of public servants who will not benefit to the extent top civil servants will benefit. It is a golden ticket for those on the highest incomes in this State and crumbs from the table for the vast majority of public sector workers. The Minister should come in and explain what the deal means and go through its detail rather than continue with this facade of fairness he is currently trying to present.

There must be structural reform also. Rather than having rhetoric, there has to be a little understanding that one cannot get one thing without doing another. For example, today the Irish Minister for Education and Skills announced an additional 610 SNA posts to complement the 220 allocated in 2014 for 2015. That makes for a total of 830 SNA posts.

It seems too simple to blame EU leaders but it is also too simple to engage in casual dismissal of the Greek people and their approach to taxes, etc. Many people will miss Mr. Varoufakis as he sails off into the sunset on his motorbike. I hope his successor, a man by the name of Euclid, is capable of the necessary political triangulation that might be needed to bring about a solution. Senator Bacik rightly mentioned the anniversary of the massacre at Srebrenica, but it is also appropriate for us to recall that this is the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Today in the House of Lords there will be a debate on Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with specific reference to freedom of religion, freedom of conscience and freedom of thought. Those rights are under major threat and attack in the world today. We should remember that the massacre of Armenian Christians, Assyrian Christians and others, and the massacre in Namibia of the Nama and Herero people in the early years of the 20th century, really began the story of genocide in the 20th century. It was Hitler who famously asked who remembers the Armenians. Modern-day Turkey does not remember them. It refuses to discuss them to this day. It behoves us, given what is happening internationally, particularly to Christians, to remember the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. I ask that we have a debate at some point soon on the persecution of Christians that is occurring in the world today. It does not matter whether one is a Christian, believer or non-believer if one is being persecuted but we cannot ignore that what is happening in the world today is affecting Christian minorities particularly acutely. Indescribable horrors are taking place.Given our own traditions and our concern and influence as a small country non-aligned in many ways it is important that we take a far more vocal and visible lead on this issue.

We have had a few clashes between the Kerry Senators in recent years relating to No. 21 on the Order Paper, the NAMA and Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Transparency Bill. Arising from the profound concerns which will now surround the sale of the northern loan book by NAMA it would be advisable if, at the earliest possible opportunity, the Minister for Finance, notwithstanding his duties on the Greek situation, would come before the House to make a clear statement in respect of this sale. In the past decade or so we have been transfixed by tribunals, inquiries and commissions of inquiry into various matters, whether planning, money to politicians, the sale of licences etc. We are now arriving at the tipping point where there will be, at some stage, perhaps in the not-too-distant future, some sort of inquiry into NAMA sales.The taxpayers and citizens of this country will be short-changed if assets are sold for less than their true worth. The ongoing revelations about Northern Ireland are of deep concern. NAMA is coming before the Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday. It is important that a clear statement is made in this regard but the overall issue of NAMA's responsibility to the taxpayer should be addressed by the Minister for Finance. I would like to have the Minister come to the House in the near future, and certainly before the summer recess, to offer us assurances in regard to NAMA sales. It is a matter of significant public interest. We are speaking about figures amounting to billions of euro and we must ensure there is absolute propriety and transparency. We need to hear from the Minister on the matter. I appreciate that the Leader cannot arrange for a debate with the Minister overnight but I ask him to arrange an opportunity before the recess for us to get the necessary assurances. I hope NAMA will also be in a position to provide clarity and certainty when it appears before the committee on Thursday.

We are hearing horrific accounts of families sending their children to orphanages because they cannot feed them and, while I wish the negotiations well this week, Greece needs a humane plan for the short term to keep its people alive. We are rightly shocked by the accounts from Greece but I have been shocked to hear accounts of pregnant women who are homeless in Dublin city. We heard a presentation on the issue this afternoon. Currently 17 pregnant women are waiting for accommodation in Dublin city. They have nowhere to go except to hostels. Last week one pregnant lady was living in a squat and another in a tent at the back of a derelict house. Pregnant women who are homeless are known as the hidden homeless. They cannot and do not beg on the streets. If they have another child it is illegal to do that, while men can. At the moment 1,034 children in 490 families are in emergency accommodation in Dublin. A social worker from Holles Street described the appalling situation of a young woman, a diabetic, who has to move out of her hostel at 9 a.m. She has nowhere to store insulin and she cannot cook appropriate food for her health. Last Christmas we had an emergency with homelessness. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and others sat around the table, and we felt there was some alleviation of the problem. Today that social worker and others from Life Pregnancy Care Ireland have said things have not improved. It is the worst accommodation crisis ever. I ask for a statement on the matter from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government prior to the summer break. How can we let our pregnant women go homeless?

The Government took the very pragmatic step in putting the national interest first by negotiating with the best hand it had in a quiet manner. While there will be many critics of this, there are no queues today at banks in Ireland to make cash withdrawals. The pharmacies here have medicines. People here can spend money because they have money. If we had listened to the counsel of some of our opponents on the strategy being pursued, we might have found ourselves in that position.

If foresight was as good as hindsight, we would not have any problem. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Finance to come to the Seanad to discuss the issue. Ireland has direct exposure of €365 million, which is our contribution to the ESM. I believe I heard of an overall Irish exposure of €2.4 billion to a Greek default or write-off. The Greek debt stands at $370 billion. According to the World Bank, the debt for the entire continent of Africa last year stood at $390 billion. The Greek debt is the same size as the debt of 54 African countries. We are asking here if we can write off debt. In light of that figure, we need to know where our priorities should lie.

Perhaps we might start here. The Greek issue is not just about the debt. Everyone seems to refer to the vote in Greece, but it is a much bigger question than that. It is a question about the European Union and the future of the euro. Greece is one of 19 eurozone members and represents 2% of the European economy. Its people are suffering, but the situation will get much worse if Greece leaves the euro because there will be food rationing and rationing of other items. We should not advocate that such a situation should occur. European political leaders and bureaucrats, who perhaps are the real leaders, need to work out a refinancing and rescheduling plan. They must stop issuing threats to the European Central Bank to the effect that it cannot lend money to Greek banks. That is disgraceful and fuelling what is happening on the streets in Greece where people cannot access their own money. There are real, fundamental issues at stake about democracy and capitalism and where both concepts cross over. Capitalism is winning and democracy is losing. Unfortunately, when political leaders and politicians protect capitalism, democracy loses. We must reflect on this. European political leaders who were elected by the people in sovereign countries must also reflect on it.

The killing of more than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys in July 1995 marked one of the darkest days in the troubled conflict that engulfed the former Yugoslavia. It was one of the worst atrocities to take place in Europe since the Second World War and was very much a failure of the international community to prevent the genocide from taking place. Mr. Mirza atibuši from Bosnia spoke very movingly and warned us of the dangers of a repeat if the international community failed to act on some of the awful things happening in the world today. I hope that in the next term we will have a discussion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the situation in Syria and other conflicts throughout the world. The official ceremony to mark the genocide in Srebrenica will take place on Saturday, 11 July. I am pleased that Ireland's ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Patrick Kelly, will represent the Government at the ceremony. As has been said, today also marks the tenth anniversary of the appalling terrorist attack in London in which 52 people were killed and more than 700 were injured. I join Senator Jim D'Arcy in very much welcoming the announcement that an additional 610 special needs assistants, SNAs, will be provided. The decision was sanctioned at today's Cabinet meeting. It will mean that every child with an assessed need will have access to an SNA. From September, there will be 11,820 whole-time SNA posts in primary and post-primary schools, an 11.7% increase since the Government took office.

As I stated, all Members agreed that the Clerys workers had been treated outrageously. They have been disregarded and treated with disdain, which is totally unacceptable. Current legislation sets out that employers must enter into a 30-day consultation period before redundancies are implemented. That is the statutory legislation period required, but it was not adhered to in the case of the Clerys workers. These loyal workers with commitments, mortgages, etc. were given one hour's notice. Company law should be amended such that any employer or someone working on behalf of an employer who fails to comply with the procedures can be removed as a director for at least five years. I support the cause and call for an urgent debate to consider the legislation required.

Consequently, I wish to make that correction to the Order of Business.  Senator Darragh O'Brien referred to the filling of a vacancy for a consultant to carry out pancreatic transplants. He also mentioned this issue last week when I suggested he might table a Commencement matter on it. I understand a motion on the issue and others is in circulation. I do not propose to accept the amendment proposed to the Order of Business on access to Fampyra. As the Senator mentioned, the issue has been discussed several times previously. On 17 June Senator Colm Burke debated a Commencement matter on it, as did Senator Martin Conway on 7 October last. Senator Colm Burke also tabled a motion on it on 4 March, while Members made statements on the issue on 26 November last. Consequently, I do not think a further debate on it would help to deal with the situation.

The commemoration held outside Leinster House was dignified and, as has been mentioned, the official commemoration will be held at a later stage.  Senator Ivana Bacik complimented the captain and crew of the LE Eithne, who certainly have done tremendous work. I believe they will be replaced in early course by another of our naval vessels.  Senator David Norris, among many other Senators, spoke about the situation in Greece. It is to be welcomed that the Greek Prime Minister will present new proposals today to deal with his country's deepening debt crisis by seeking another bailout. It is also to be welcomed that the European Central Bank will continue to provide emergency liquidity assistance for the banks. I agree with the comments made by Members that there should always be flexibility to accommodate changes to bailout programmes sought by governments. I remind Members that when the Government took office, it secured significant changes to our bailout programme. It replaced the €750 million in further income tax increases agreed to by the previous Government with alternative measures that were less damaging to jobs. The Government secured agreement to reverse the cuts made by Fianna Fáil to the minimum wage, to cut the lower rate of employer's PRSI for three years and to cut the VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sectors from 13.5% to 9%, which resulted in the creation of more than 30,000 jobs.The Government also secured interest rate reductions on the bailout debts and got rid of the promissory notes relating to the IBRC.

Senator Hayden referred to a number of terrorist atrocities carried out across the globe. The Senator also raised the issue of access to legal aid. Senator Quinn referred to poor building practices during the Celtic tiger era and stated that new building regulations are being put in place. The Minister has requested that anybody who wants to have an input into the process to make a submission.

Perhaps the Senator might take that opportunity to raise the matter to which he refers with the Minister. The Senator also referred to the death of Kathleen Hayes who was 113 years old, a remarkable age.

Senator Mullins called for a debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on Syria and other areas of conflict.

IBEC warned that employers might be very slow to enter into an REA if by doing so they would be exposing themselves to the REA being varied without their consent. This concern is not applicable in this instance as we are providing that an employer may apply to become party to the agreement that has already been registered. Therefore, the agreement itself will not be varied and an employer will simply be added to it. This was proposed by both the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the TEEU and in our view it is important to table this amendment.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	198	I thank Senator Cullinane. The purpose of the amendment is to allow an employer sign up to an existing REA as a new party to the agreement. However, section 8 already provides for a mechanism by which an REA can be varied in its application to any worker or workers to whom it applies. In this regard, the variation provisions under section 8 would allow for an application by a new employer to become party to an existing REA, subject to one of the existing parties to the agreement making the application to the court. Alternatively, it is always open to an employer to enter into a separate collective agreement involving the same terms and conditions with a trade union and have that registered with the Labour Court. The amendment might also have the consequences of permitting an employer become party to an REA against the wishes of the original signatories and then to seek to have it modified, also contrary to the wishes of the original signatories. For the reasons outlined I cannot accept the amendment.

It sought an amendment to provide for adequate notice to be given to trade unions where the Labour Court might or intends to cancel an REA because the trade union is considered to be no longer substantially representative of the workers to whom the agreement pertains. Our amendment provides in this situation for notice to be given to the trade union or trade unions involved and to allow them to state their case, which is essentially what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions called for. It is a right to be heard and a right for unions to have their say.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	200	Section 10(5) provides that the Labour Court may cancel the registration of an employment agreement if it is satisfied the trade union party to the agreement is no longer substantially representative of the workers concerned. The purpose of amendment No. 3 is to require the court to give three months notice to the trade union of its decision and to allow for an appeal within six weeks of the decision. Any consideration by the Labour Court as to whether a trade union is no longer substantially representative of the workers concerned would require the court to engage with the union in advance and to consider submissions from the union on the issue.In this regard the union would clearly have advance notice of the Labour Court's consideration. It is not considered appropriate to allow an REA to remain in place for three months after it has been determined by the Labour Court that a trade union is no longer substantially representative of the workers. It is also important to remember that the cancellation of an REA does not affect an individual worker's entitlement to the terms of an REA under their personal contract of employment, which can only be changed by agreement between the worker and the employer. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.

I understand what is permissible and what is envisaged in the legislation and what the Labour Court will have to do in terms of consultation. However, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is saying is that is not good enough, that it should be given the opportunity to state its case and that adequate notice should be given. We are seeking to strengthen that provision which, the Minister of State has said exists, and which we believe is too weak, as does the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. It would make sense and would strengthen the Bill if the Labour Court was to make a judgment that the unions were no longer substantially representative. At least the trade unions would be able to make a case rather than just being consulted, which is my understanding of what is being provided for in the Bill.

Essentially the inclusion of country money is consistent with the existing practice within the construction sector. It is a term used to deal with the reality that many construction workers face where they have to travel to their place of employment, for example, the many people who may have to travel from different parts of the country to Dublin to work for large construction firms. That is the reality and costs are incurred by workers while working away from home. Country money and associated costs are different from standard travelling time pay, which is linked to different journeys on a daily basis, for example, provision for one hour travelling time, beyond four miles of a worker's workplace or fixed location. Construction workers often have to travel to a job for a period of days, weeks or longer and the existing practice of country money provides for this. We understand there is no opposition from contractors for the inclusion of such a provision. If the contractors are not opposed to it and the unions involved are supportive, it would strengthen the Bill if included and the amendment was accepted.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	205	Section 13 provides for a definition of "remuneration" for the purposes of a Labour Court recommendation for the terms of a sectoral employment order. The definition is based on the definition of remuneration included in the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012. The definition includes basic pay and a list of other elements in excess of basic pay that may be included as part of the court's recommendation for a rate of remuneration for a particular sector. I understand that the payment of country money was a feature of the former registered employment agreement with the construction sector. Generally speaking, employees in that sector do not have a permanent fixed place of work and are required to travel, as the Senator pointed out, to different building sites according to the duration of the employer's contract at each site. In this context I do not consider that country money, which is designed to compensate employees for expenses incurred travelling distances to and from building sites and to cover subsistence expenses, is part of a person's pay. Moreover, I understand that the payment of country money may be made without deduction of tax and PRSI where certain conditions are met. Accordingly, I would not propose to include it as part of the definition of remuneration, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.

It is important to keep a focus on these issues because a number of factors in the labour market are of concern to everybody, for example, the high levels of low pay. I do not have to give the Minister of State my view of it. Report after report from EUROSTAT to the OECD, TASC, the CSO, all show that 20% of workers in the State are deemed to be in low-pay jobs. We also have a difficulty with precariousness, an increase of under-employment, part-time work and short-hour contracts, which are becoming much more prevalent in the labour market, by design more than by accident if we are honest. The section provides that when making a recommendation to the Minister, the Labour Court shall have regard to a number of factors, for example, the potential impact on levels of employment and unemployment in the applicable sector and the potential impact on competitiveness in the sector concerned. The provision reflects similar factors that the Low Pay Commission must also consider when it makes a recommendation to the Minister. In order to be consistent with what the Low Pay Commission must do and the factors it must be asked to reflect on, we believe that is what should be done when looking at an REA. While these may be relevant factors, they reflect on an imbalance in terms of considerations that weigh heavily in favour of employers and encourage the increasing levels of sharp practice we see across the economy. Identifying and acknowledging high levels of low pay across the various sectors and the use of part-time or short-hour contracts is highly relevant to one of the key objectives of this legislation, which is to promote harmonious relations between workers and employers. Is that not one of the reasons there is unrest in some sectors, such as the retail sector? We are aware of many companies which are exploiting their workers and of campaigns being fought by the trade unions involved to ensure that does not happen. When analysing data and information for the purpose of forming REAs it would make sense that these issues of under unemployment, short-hour contracts, levels of pay and low pay should also be considerations. I ask the Minister of State to support this amendment which has been supported by the trade unions who have been in contact with us.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	207	Section 16 sets out a comprehensive and challenging set of factors that the Labour Court has to take into account when making a recommendation to the Minister in respect of a sectoral employment order. Amendment No. 5 would add two further factors that the court would be required to take into account. I have given significant consideration to these criteria with Government colleagues. I do not consider it necessary to refer specifically to median earnings changes or proportions above or below particular proportions of median earnings, particularly when one of the criteria specifically requires the court to look at the general level of remuneration in other sectors where similar workers are employed. The Bill also requires the court, in making a recommendation, to be of the view that the recommendation is reasonably necessary to ensure fair and sustainable rates of remuneration in the sector concerned. I believe that the structure we are setting up in this legislation will do exactly that and has been welcomed by all sides of industry. The suggestion in regard to the pervasiveness of part-time and short-hour contracts is part of a wider decent work agenda that I am pursuing, including the issue of zero-hour and low-hour contracts. The Senator will be aware of the study I commissioned that is being undertaken by the University of Limerick. I expect that study will be completed soon. I look forward to considering its findings and sharing them with Oireachtas and Government colleagues. Where the evidence points to some adjustment being required to the protections that are already in place in Irish employment law, these will be brought forward for consideration by the Government. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.

I do not wish to make the point again. This is an issue I would have argued over a long period with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation during debates on various Bills. The view is that wages are seen as simply a cost to the economy and not as a driver. We need to take a different view. I know it is a Fine Gael view but I would hope it is not a view shared by the Labour Party that competitiveness is all on the basis of driving down the pay and conditions of workers and seeing wages as an impediment to a thriving economy.In fact, all the evidence points to the contrary: those countries in Europe which have good wages, decent work and decent pay are actually better-performing economies than our economy. Some other countries engage in a race to the bottom and view wages solely from the prism of competitiveness and not as a driver of the economy - if people have money in their pockets they can spend and it is a positive rather than a negative. It is nonsensical that the court would have to consider the potential impact of a recommendation on competitiveness to the economy but not be asked to look at the opposite side or the other side of the economy. To be honest, this is an ideological mindset, probably coming from the other side of Government. It seems they will not accept this amendment. I am disappointed. In light of the criticisms I had of the Low Pay Commission and this legislation there does not seem to be enough of a focus from this Government on the impact of low pay, short-term contracts and hours and precariousness of the economy as well as the policy decisions which flow as a result. Here is an opportunity for the Government to allow the courts to reflect and be mindful of those issues as well. I am disappointed with the response of the Minister of State. It seems to suggest he will not be accepting the amendment.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	211	It is as clear as the nose on my face that the legislation on sectoral employment orders seeks to ensure fairness and the same rate of remuneration. This is a requirement to reach an SEO or for an SEO to be made. That takes into account rates of pay and the fairness of rates of pay in a given sector. This architecture has been supported by the trade union movement, which has not found fault in it. I very much welcome that support for the legislation. The fact that we are introducing sectoral employment orders soon after the old registered employment agreement architecture was struck down by the Supreme Court is an illustration of the Government's commitment to address the pay issue. We see it in a balanced way. We need to be competitive and ensure that businesses can grow and not only survive but thrive, because we need businesses to create jobs. However, we also need to ensure that the rates of pay in our economic sectors are fair and sustainable. We have to take a balanced approach. No one can say this Government is not mindful of the need to ensure that there are decent rates of pay in the economy. That is reflected in the fact that we have set up the Low Pay Commission, introduced collective bargaining legislation in the context of this Bill and that we are introducing a new SEO and REA system. This is not happening anywhere else in Europe. It would have been easy for the Government to take the view after an unprecedented economic crisis that we would hollow out our employment protections and throw low-paid workers to the wolves, but we have not done that. In fact what we have done is to the contrary and that has been recognised internationally. We did not take that option, as other countries have. Other countries have been subject to troika programmes. We have done exactly the opposite and we should acknowledge that. That is not to say there are no challenges. My only regret is that I have only had a year to do some of this work. I would have preferred five years and I look forward to completing my agenda in the next term.

The court is asked to look at a number of things. Obviously the rate of pay is the main element. The Minister of State will be aware that the difficulty for workers in short-term contracts is not so much the rate - obviously that is one of the issues - but the short-term nature of their contracts. This came up in the context of the ability of the Low Pay Commission to vary the minimum wage. It may increase the minimum wage and that would be good for those workers affected, but for someone on a low-hours contract the difficulty or problem is the hours. Their hours can be cut because of the precarious nature of their employment or because of the nature of their contracts. We are asking that amendment No. 6 be added so that the hours of work are also taken into account. This would actually do something pragmatic and constructive for Dunnes Stores workers. This legislation, if passed, in some ways might do something. It is one of the employers which simply will not engage with the trade unions. It is despicable that we have a domestic retail company which makes vast amounts of money and very healthy profits in this country but simply will not negotiate with the trade union involved. That is an absolute disgrace. Whatever about my views of the limitations of the collective bargaining provisions in the Bill, at least it opens up the possibility that the company may be forced to engage with the industrial relations machinery. This is one of the clear difficulties facing that category of workers. Pay is one element but hours is the critical point and low-hour contracts is the critical issue. We are asked about this over and over again and pressure is being put on us. I saw numerous Labour Party Deputies and Senators at the Clerys protest and at the Dunnes Stores protest and rally some weeks ago, and rightly so. People ask us what we are going to do as legislators to ensure that their issues are dealt with. This is something we can do, small as it is. The Minister of State could accept this amendment and ensure that hours of work is something to which the court would have to give consideration. I call on the Minister of State to support the amendment in that spirit.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	216	I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to Senator Cullinane on this point. The Mandate trade union has not formally made the point to me about hours of work, but it has made the point, publicly and privately, that the utility of the collective bargaining legislation is clear in terms of potentially assisting the trade union in the context of the dispute to which Senator Cullinane has referred, a dispute that has appalled all of us in this House and elsewhere. This provides a strengthened opportunity for trade unions to bring cases on behalf of their members to the Labour Court in a robust fashion and have the terms and conditions of a particular group of workers compared against an analogous group of workers in similar employment, whether they are represented by trade unions, and, crucially, where collective agreements are commonplace. I believe this provides a host of opportunities in constitutionally robust law that will allow for people's pay and terms and conditions to be improved if it is a case that a trade union brings a case through the Labour Court and secures a recommendation, ultimately imposed through the Circuit Court, if it is the case that there is no engagement or if an employer refuses to engage. All of the provisions are, by and large, welcomed by trade unions. We can see how effective they can be in advancing the rights of working people to improve pay and terms and conditions. The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to provide that in addition to a recommendation in respect of the remuneration, sick pay and pension provisions for a sector, a recommendation from the Labour Court may include hours of work in the recommendation. Section 14 provides that a trade union of workers or organisation of employers, which, the Labour Court is satisfied, is substantially representative of workers or employers in a particular sector, may, separately or jointly, call on the Labour Court to examine the terms and conditions relating to the remuneration and sick pay or pensions of workers in the sector and ask the court to make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter. Accordingly, the Labour Court examination is confined to consideration of remuneration, as defined, including sick pay and pensions provisions. Hours of work do not come within the scope of the court's examination in the context of sectoral employment orders and, therefore, it would not be appropriate for the court to include hours of work in a recommendation. Hours of work are of course already governed generally by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and, therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	217	I have two queries for the Minister of State on the section. The first relates to section 16(2).It states that when making a recommendation, the court shall have regard to certain matters, the most important of which is the potential impact on employment levels. How will that adjudication be framed? Perhaps a broader debate is taking place on the issues of low pay, pay rates and pay increases, but unless there is employment, the issue of pay does not come into it. What will be the determination on the potential impact on employment levels? Is there a prescribed yardstick or will a philosophical discussion take place within the court? Will guidelines be issued? Employers are adamant that employment levels will be impacted on. How will that adjudication be made? My second question relates to section 16(4) which states the court will not make a recommendation unless it is satisfied on certain factors. One of the conditions is that the recommendation promote harmonious relations between workers and employers. It is difficult to understand at what point the adjudication will take place, given that if a matter is before the court for determination, it means that the relationship between workers and the employer may not be that harmonious. Will there be a set of guidelines, rules or provisions to be used in making an adjudication leading to harmonious relations between workers and the employer? I know what I am saying is rather vague, but in a sense, it goes to the kernel of the decision-making process. Who will decide whether a decision is good or bad in terms of employment and whether it is good for the creation or maintenance of harmonious relations? Unless we are clear on that matter, while the legislation appears strong and to be proactive, it may not do what the Minister of State wishes it to do because of these clauses which are necessary. We can have a debate about pay rates, but, above all, we must have employment and employment creation opportunities. Will the Minister of State outline his thoughts on these queries at this initial stage?
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	218	It is an interesting point. Let me start with the Senator's reference to harmonious industrial relations, a principle with which those engaged in the sector will be familiar. The Minister of the day will need to be satisfied before signing an order that it will promote industrial peace and harmonious industrial relations. In the absence of the old REA system which was struck down by the Supreme Court in a judgement in 2013 we have seen difficulties in the construction sector. That sector may decide independently that it wishes to have a sectoral employment order under this legislation. Having harmonious industrial relations and industrial peace is important. We need them for the industry to flourish, jobs to be created and contracts to be completed. Let us be honest: the wisdom, experience and judgment of experienced members of the Labour Court and their staff will be important, as they always are in settling industrial disputes, but this is about the avoidance of industrial disputes and creating harmonious and peaceful industrial relations to allow jobs to be created and maintained and employers to win contracts. The Senator's point about the maintenance of employment is important and central to consideration of sectoral employment orders. In discussing the previous amendment we spoke about fair and sustainable rates of payment and how they were central to the court's consideration in making an order or recommending that an order be signed by the Minister of the day. No less than the Low Pay Commission, the Labour Court should and will use evidence from both sides of industry when making its recommendations. It is also in a position to carry out its own research, which it does on a regular basis. Ultimately, it is the expert judgment of the court that must be applied in situations such as this, but the Minister of the day will have to be satisfied that a sectoral employment order will promote harmonious industrial relations and have an impact on employment levels. He or she will have to be conscious of the levels of unemployment in a particular sector because it would be completely pointless if he or she were to decide to make an order that had a negative impact on employment levels in an economic sector. It is about trying to promote job creation and ensuring businesses can win contracts and flourish and that we promote harmonious industrial relations in a sector.

We have referred a number of times in both Houses of the Oireachtas to the blacklisting scandal exposed in Great Britain. It has been found that major construction companies engaged in systematic surveillance and the blacklisting of trade unionists over a 30-year period, resulting in victimisation, violence, unemployment and horrific hardship for families and communities. BAM, Carillion and Balfour Beatty are just three of over 30 companies named and shamed in the scandal. For years, trade union activities and the day-to-day lives of the families, friends and loved ones of construction workers were monitored and recorded. Construction workers were left perpetually unemployed. When work was secured, they would be let go without fault or warning within a day or so. Subcontractors lost contracts on sites because they refused to lay off labourers who happened to be on the principal contractor's blacklist. The Government tells us on a regular basis that the Irish and British economies are intertwined. If that is the case, it would be preposterous to suggest the widespread blacklisting of trade unionists in Great Britain has not been repeated here or that the companies involved in this scandal take a different attitude to Irish trade unionists when operating in the State. Earlier this year the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee produced a damning report on blacklisting in employment and recommended the holding of a full public inquiry.  When this issue has been debated publicly, I have heard from some, mainly employers, that there is no evidence of the blacklisting of trade unionists in this State. The same argument was made in Great Britain until the work of the consultants' association was uncovered, exposing the widespread and systematic practice of the blacklisting of over 3,000 trade union activists by over 30 major contractors. It would stretch people's imaginations or the credibility of the argument to suggest this is not happening or has not happened in this State. I believe it has happened. In Dave Smith and Phil Chamberlain's recently published book on the blacklisting scandal in Great Britain, Labour Party MP John McDonnell wrote that blacklisting had three direct and deliberate effects. The first, obviously, is to break the individual in order that he or she is forced to choose between earning a living and being an active trade unionist. The second is to quarantine the individual in order that in denying him or her access to the workplace, he or she will have no ability to represent, influence, persuade or mobilise others to stand up for their rights at work. The third is to send a message to any other person who may be tempted to join a trade union.  There has been always a major gap in legislation in this State when it comes to anti-victimisation measures. It is welcome that there are provisions in the Bill that provide further protection for workers. It is a credit to the Minister of State and the Government that they have included these elements in the Bill. In the case of the Dunnes Stores workers, Mandate has clearly indicated where it sees potential for the victimisation of workers.That is the problem with such contracts. If anyone steps out of line, joins a trade union or wears a trade union pin, he or she will not get the hours. It would not make sense, when we look at what has happened in Great Britain and the huge controversy caused by the reports and findings following investigations on blacklisting, to suggest it would not happen here. In fact, many people have come to me, primarily in the construction sector but it happens in other sectors also, to tell me that they have been blacklisted because they stood up for themselves and their fellow employees. As a result, they are unable to find jobs or if they do, they will only last a week or two. The amendments seek to deal with the issue of blacklisting in a satisfactory way.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	221	Amendment No. 7 seeks to include a prohibition on the blacklisting of a worker in the anti-victimisation provisions in section 19 if workers are covered by an SEO. The blacklisting of persons, for whatever reason, is an abhorrent practice, particularly for those exercising their rights regarding their remuneration or terms of employment. If there is evidence that this is a widespread practice in Ireland, I will move on it, but, to date, I have heard no evidence that it is and in my daily contacts with trade union officials the issue has not been raised with me. The Senator appears to have suggested he is aware of some cases of blacklisting. If he is, perhaps he might bring them to my attention in whatever way he wishes. The issue could and should be addressed. However, it is unwise to address such a fundamental issue in a piecemeal manner, as suggested in the amendment. If action is needed in this area, it will have to be addressed in the round and the context of the suite of industrial relations and employment legislation. The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to add trade union membership or activity to the activities in respect of which an employer may not penalise a worker to whom an SEO applies. A number of protections are in place for workers who consider they have been subjected to victimisation in the workplace. Any worker who finds himself or herself the subject of victimisation already has the opportunity to take a case under the Industrial Relations Acts. The 2004 code of practice on victimisation provides that, where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of his or her legitimate actions or affiliation arising from that dispute. A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation is set out in the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and these protections will be further enhanced in the provisions in Part 3 of the Bill in regard to the Government's commitment on collective bargaining. I welcome the Senator's reference to it, but, given what I have said, I cannot accept the amendments.

Prior to the McGowan judgment, these entitlements were part and parcel of the REA framework underpinning the right of an individual to trade union representation and all that it entailed. We had this discussion on Second Stage in identifying one of the perceived weaknesses in the Bill, namely, the voluntary element of the collective bargaining framework being put in place. This goes back to a fundamental right workers should have, that is, to be represented by their trade union in their place of work or at an employment rights body. The reason workers join trade unions in the first place is that if they find themselves in difficulty or conflict with their employer, many of them obviously will not understand the myriad industrial relations laws and the maze the employment rights bodies can be. Even though it has been simplified by the Government through the Workplace Relations Commission, it is still quite onerous for workers to understand exactly what they are entitled to and to negotiate with employers. Sometimes, because of the power structure, employers hold all of the cards. They are the ones who employ and it is very difficult for employees to even raise questions about their terms and conditions of employment, let alone engage in conflict. That is why we have trade unions. They are skilled, understand industrial relations law, are qualified, can properly represent workers and make sure they have fair representation. It would be preposterous if trade union officials were not able to be present in a person's workplace to try to solve problems, given that part of their remit is to try to find solutions to workplace problems where there is conflict. We would see these amendments as strengthening the Bill and they would certainly be welcomed by the trade unions involved. As I said, trade unions should be entitled to represent their members' interests and should have access to workplaces. If the amendments were accepted by the Minister, it would strengthen the overall intent of the Bill.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	224	Amendment No. 9 seeks to provide a role for trade union officials in the enforcement of registered employment agreements, registered employment orders which are more correctly entitled sectoral employment orders and employment regulation orders. It would also provide for the Minister making regulations providing for a right of access for trade union officials to the workplace and employees. It seeks to prohibit an employer from coercing workers to relinquish or abstain from an REA. In respect of registered employment agreements, it is clearly a matter for the parties concerned whether they wish to include in the agreement provisions on access to workplaces for trade union officials. An REA will be binding on the parties to the agreement. I am aware that some previous REAs such as the construction sector REA provided that, in the event of concerns regarding compliance, a union official would have access to a designated member of management. It is totally open to the parties to an REA to agree to similar provisions in the future. It had been suggested during the course of these debates that primary law provided for this under the former REA regime, but it manifestly did not and we should not be confused on this point. On the appointment of other persons, including union officials, as inspectors, it has to be appreciated that the powers given to National Employment Rights Authority inspectors are extensive. They include, for example, the power to use reasonable force to enter a place of work or a premises where there is a reasonable belief it is being used for the employment of persons or the keeping of records. NERA inspectors have powers to copy records and remove books, documents or records for a period they reasonably consider to be necessary. They can, under warrant of the District Court, enter a domestic dwelling with other inspectors or members of An Garda Síochána in pursuit of documents or records. Such extensive powers are rightly and appropriately reserved solely for officers of the Minister who are appointed as inspectors. It is vital that trade unions are able to represent the interests of their members and take action in support of these interests. The laws of the State vindicate that right and the provisions of this legislation will help in the context of a new collective bargaining regime. However, the suggestion that trade union officials should have a statutory right to enter a workplace to meet workers, even in workplaces that do not recognise trade unions, does not accord with the voluntarist approach to industrial relations that has been adopted through the decades. Whether we accept that voluntarist approach, that is a fact. Moreover and significantly, it would leave the urgent legislation before us open to the possibility of a legal challenge on an employer's constitutional right not to engage with or recognise trade unions. We must be mindful of this point, particularly given the necessity and urgency of this legislation. Having worked with the relevant actors to restore sectoral frameworks following the McGowan decision in 2013, I am not going to jeopardise for one minute the significant gains for workers and employers contained in the Bill by opening the door to such a challenge. I do not think there is any shortage of people who do not agree with me and the Senator on the urgency of the legislation and what it has been designed to achieve. There may very well be individuals and organisations that will be looking closely at the legislation and would be prepared to challenge it and I do not want to open the door to any degree for that to happen.Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment. Amendment No. 10 provides an entitlement for a union to represent an employee's interests under an REA or sectoral employment agreement, including on matters involving discipline and grievance procedures. In this regard, section 41(15) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 already provides that a trade union official can accompany a worker in proceedings before an adjudication officer in regard to a complaint. Section 44(9) of that Act has the same provision in respect of proceedings before the Labour Court. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 10. Amendment No. 11 proposes further rights of access to workplaces for trade union officials, for the purpose of monitoring compliance with REAs and SEOs and also with a view to carrying out trade union business on the premises with workers. Therefore, for the reasons I outlined previously in regard to amendment No. 9, I cannot accept this amendment.

We are doing so against a backdrop of employers who have consistently challenged the industrial relations architecture of the State through the courts and have tried to dismantle it through the High Court and Supreme Court. We have seen that. I fully appreciate therefore the concern the Minister of State has that when he brings forward legislation within the confines of the existing Constitution, we must protect all of us and employees against further challenges of that nature. I accept that, but the difficulty is that we are operating in that very narrow view. The provisions seem to be heavily weighted in favour of employers, where the rights of employers and the right to private property seem to take precedence on almost every occasion, above and beyond the rights of workers. It might sound draconian when we say there should be mandatory trade union recognition or it should be mandatory that a trade union official could walk into a place of employment without the consent of the employer, but no employee can prevent an employer from getting legal advice. An employer can spend huge amounts of money on getting advice from solicitors and barristers and get all the support and advice he wants. There is no problem in doing that and there is nothing employees can do about it. However, when they want to be represented in their place of work, or if they have a conflict with their employer and have paid union dues to be properly represented when there is conflict, they cannot do that if the employer does not want to engage with the trade unions.  Is it not telling that the very companies that do not engage with the trade unions, whether Ryanair, Dunnes Stores or any of those companies that will not recognise the trade unions, have the worst possible record when it comes to paying their workers and treating them fairly? There is a clear issue here that must be dealt with at some point. I believe we must have the courage at some point to go to the people on a constitutional referendum about mandatory trade union recognition. Essentially, that may be what is necessary to deal with the issues I have raised. I am not saying the Minister of State is opposed to that. I understand the difficulties and the challenges this would present to the labour movement and to all of us who believe in fairness and justice for workers. However, the provisions currently are weighted very heavily in favour of employers. We see this all of the time and we must continue to challenge it. We cannot simply always accept there are constitutional constraints and that there is nothing we can do. We cannot continue to wash our hands of responsibility every time there is a problem - Vita Cortex, Lagan Brick, Game, Waterford Crystal, Clerys, Dunnes Stores - and say there is nothing we can do about it, because the situation is too complex. All of these issues are complex when we need to do something for workers, but there is no problem with introducing legislation for other issues.  If we are serious about having fairness for workers and a level playing field, we must grasp the nettle and deal with these issues. I accept the limitations on the Minister of State in framing this Bill. I have also spoken to many senior trade unionists, who would be very concerned about the possibility of a referendum, because of the forces of the Right and all the employer organisations that would line up against it, with all sorts of nonsense arguments. I accept that, but we must also accept that we cannot continue with the narrow constitutional framework we are all operating under currently while trying to get the best possible protections for workers, and then having to bring forward legislation that is rigid, narrow and quite limited because of these constraints we operate under. We need to have the vision to look beyond that and have the courage, at some point, to go beyond what is in this Bill. In saying this, I accept the huge steps forward being taken in this Bill. I will say no more on this because similar issues will be raised with the next amendment coming forward.

“Regulations
22. The Minister may by regulations provide for a mechanism to provide for representation by or on behalf of retired employees, including organised groups of retired employees, in relation to his, her or their pensions, deferred or otherwise.”.Introducing an amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil in regard to this, to include retired or deferred workers in the collective bargaining section of the Bill, was a positive move which we supported. However, in practical terms the Minister of State's amendments do not guarantee that IASS deferred members will now be assured of representation in negotiations on their pension scheme or that retired pensioners at Tara Mines or the ESB retired staff association will be allowed representation before trustees apply for a section 50 order to the Pensions Authority, rather than after, as provided for by the Minister for Social Protection in the regulation. This is a problem that needs to be examined and this is what we seek to do through this amendment by inserting: "The Minister may by regulations provide for a mechanism to provide for representation by or on behalf of retired employees, including organised groups of retired employees, in relation to his, her or their pensions, deferred or otherwise."
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	228	Amendment No. 12 deals with the issue of access by retired persons to the industrial relation machinery of the State and provides for the insertion of a new section to the Bill providing that the Minister may by regulation provide for a mechanism to provide for representation by or on behalf of retired employees in regard to pensions matters. I fully appreciate the concerns of retired and deferred members of pension schemes whose schemes are being restructured, particularly where such restructuring may impact on existing or potential pension benefits. I am only too familiar with the cases involving the Tara Mines pensioners and I have worked on behalf of many of them over the years and on behalf of the Aer Lingus group also. This is an issue to which careful consideration has been given, not just by me, but by Government colleagues. In doing so, it was important to bear in mind that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature, both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations in this country. As matters stand, where changes to pension schemes are negotiated at company level, whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise, the outcome of that engagement cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Rather, any proposed changes to the scheme are effected through the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules or deeds of the scheme. In terms of changes to pension schemes generally, Senator Cullinane will be aware that the trustees of a particular pension scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members, be they active, deferred or pensioner members. Until recently, this has been done on an individual basis and did not provide for a collective voice to be heard. As I have stated, the matter has been given careful consideration and as a consequence, the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection has recently introduced regulations and approved amendments to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority to provide for the recognition by the trustees of a pensions scheme of groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred members of pension schemes. These changes mean that all groups representing the interests of the various categories of pension scheme membership are treated the same in the context of the provisions in the Pensions Act. The changes to the regulations will require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to such proposals. In addition, the Pensions Authority is now required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes to either issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to such proposals. The regulations also give the representative group the right to appeal such a direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law. It is within this framework, rather than through the State’s industrial relations machinery, that a collective approach should be correctly effected. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 12.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	229	I move amendment No. 13:In page 22, line 32, to delete “voluntary”. This relates to the second last contribution of the Minister and the debate we had on the three grouped amendments. We seek to delete the word "voluntary" and we do so knowing it is not the solution that would be necessary to bring about mandatory trade union recognition, but we do so as an opportunity to again raise the issue and to have a discussion on it. While welcoming many of the Bill's provisions, we could not let it pass without raising the need for mandatory trade union recognition. When one uses a word such as "mandatory", it can conjure up images of draconian legislation where one is forcing somebody to do something, but in reality it is very simple. It is actually about rights - the right of a worker to be represented by his or her trade union. I was elected through the Labour Panel to represent those who are in work, as were other Members. I wish all of them the best of luck in the next Seanad election. Some of them are present, although none of them has spoken on the Bill so far. Perhaps that is something they might have to consider if they are seeking re-election on the Labour Panel. Nonetheless, it is an important issue because if we continue along the road of the voluntarist way of doing things, even with the provisions in this Bill, we will still have big employers in the State who think it is acceptable to disregard trade unions and treat their workers with contempt. That is essentially what they do when they refuse to recognise trade unions. It is not that they are protecting some sort of right, that they see the provisions as being draconian or in contravention of their rights. It is a case of their being involved in a battle with trade unions and their employees. In effect, it is employers saying they will not recognise workers and they do not care who workers consider their representatives, that the employers will not talk to them or engage with them just because they can. The vast majority of employers in the State are good, decent employers who recognise trade unions and the value of working out arrangements and resolutions to issues with the representatives of workers. Such a situation benefits everybody. That is why, by and large, employment regulation orders, EROs, registered employment agreements, REAs, and joint labour committees, JLCs, worked in the past, because employers and employees from various sectors came together, agreed and registered agreements and then had collective agreements in place. By and large, that worked until some unscrupulous employers decided they did not like it and they decided to challenge the system, which is what they did. We are dealing with the results of what happened. It will continue to be a problem in industrial relations law for as long as we allow it to be the case. In reality, what we are doing is setting up a system for unscrupulous employers who do not recognise trade unions to be forced to go in the back door and to be obliged to resort to the industrial relations or employment rights bodies. At least that element is now in place, which is a step forward. While I am critical of the employers involved, I accept the constitutional limitations on the ability of the Government to introduce legislation. I accept that the Minister of State has done his best in the context of the existing constitutional position and also in the knowledge of the court cases and court challenges that have already taken place. I fully appreciate and understand that, but if we ever want to deal with the issue in its totality and to allow workers to be properly and fairly treated, including represented by their trade unions, which they should be, then we will have to take a step further. We will commit to that in our election manifesto in the next election. We want to see mandatory trade union recognition. We will have the courage to do so. I do not say the Minister of State or his party would not have the courage to support that. Let us work with the trade unions and get the best possible constitutional framework that balances the rights of both employers and employees. Unfortunately, at the moment the balance is skewed in favour of employers. The reason we tabled the amendment is to raise the issue again and to debate what the next step will be. In any situation, when there is a gain, it can be a step or two forward but there is always the next step and the step after that. For all of us who are interested in labour rights, equality and workers rights, the next step is to have mandatory trade union recognition in the State, despite how it will be spun and challenged by some vested interests. The vast majority of employers would have no difficulty with the concept because they already recognise trade unions and they have a good relationship with trade unions but it is the minority, those who have something to hide or to fear, who do not want trade union recognition. For all of the criticisms multinational companies come under at times, very few of them have any difficulty with trade unions. They encourage them because they see it is an important function of democracy that people have a right to be represented by their trade unions. Employers see it as a benefit in that they deal with a small number of very qualified and skilled trade union officials. It is the next step along the road and I hope that after the Bill is passed and we net the gains contained in the Bill, we will move towards the next step at some point.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	230	I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to Senator Cullinane who made some very important points. I am also pleased that he very responsibly pointed out the constraints and limitations in terms of the Constitution, because not everybody who is contributing to the debate acknowledges that. Senator Cullinane has widely acknowledged the point, not just today but regularly in his public commentary on the issue. There is very little point in discussing the matter without recognising the constitutional constraints. It is another argument as to whether that would be addressed at some stage in the future. The proposed legislation has the potential to transform relationships between employers and employees in this country. We will have a legally and constitutionally robust system. In talking about mandatory trade union recognition we must look at the experience of analogous countries across Europe. In countries where there is mandatory trade union recognition we must be conscious of the different models that are applied. From my experience of speaking to trade unionists internationally, I am aware that in some countries where mandatory trade union recognition is available they might prefer to have the collective bargaining model we seek to introduce because the bar is set so high in some mandatory regimes as to make it ineffective. We must have an honest discussion about what mandatory trade union recognition would look like, how it is modelled elsewhere, and how it works elsewhere in practice. I am convinced that the legislation we hope to see enacted in this country will have the potential to transform industrial relations in this country in a positive way and to rebalance the agenda in some respects. The purpose of this amendment is to remove the reference to the term “voluntary” from the proposed definition of collective bargaining in section 23. In developing these legislative proposals, the Government has been keen to respect the positions articulated by stakeholders to develop proposals that sustain our voluntary system.It also ensures that workers have confidence that, where there is no collective bargaining, they have an effective system that ensures they can air grievances about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined by the Labour Court, if necessary, based on those in similar companies and secured by way of Circuit Court Order. Worker and employer stakeholders have played a very critical role in assisting the Government to develop a clear and workable framework in this area, in the spirit of social dialogue and partnership. In this context, the definition of collective bargaining, provided for in section 23, was the subject of very detailed consideration by me, by my Department and employer and worker representatives. It has been agreed, in essence, with those stakeholder interests in the spirit of collaboration, partnership and very real social dialogue. It is important to remember as well that it has been the consistent policy of successive Irish Governments to promote collective bargaining, through the laws of this country and through the development of an institutional framework, supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations that is premised upon the freedom of contract and freedom of association. However, we will not go into the constitutional arguments about that, at this point. The system has, notwithstanding all the points made by Senator Cullinane, served the country well in delivering industrial peace and economic development in recent years. It has made a significant contribution to our economic success in the two decades preceding 2008. It remains central to sustaining Ireland’s economic recovery. I think it will be instrumental in delivering a fair and balanced recovery. The principle of volunteerism is also recognised at an international level. Article 4 of ILO Convention 98 is on the right to organise and collective bargaining. It states: Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.

This is a redraft of section 43 in order to make clear the steps and processes involved in an inquiry and the responsibilities of the disciplinary committee and panels. The various avenues for conducting or completing inquiries are also set out. To summarise the process, the disciplinary committee will write to the teacher informing him or her of the nature of the complaint, including evidence supporting the complaint, and an opportunity for the teacher to request that the matter be investigated by examination of documents. If a hearing is to be held, the teacher will be informed that he or she, or the teacher’s representative, may be present to defend the teacher at the hearing and that the teacher may request that some or all of the hearing is to be held in private. The inquiry will be carried out by a panel of the disciplinary committee, consisting of three to five persons, the majority of whom will be registered teachers. At the request of the teacher, the panel may agree to hold the inquiry by consideration of documents and written submissions only, that is in place of a hearing. Having considered the complaint, the panel may request the teacher to do one or more of the following, and before a hearing has taken place: undertake not to repeat the conduct; undertake to attend a specified professional development course, or such other course as the panel considers appropriate; undertake to comply with such requirements as may be specified for the purposes of improving his or her competence and performance; consent to seek the assistance of such services relating to health and welfare as may be specified; and consent to being censured. Where a registered teacher gives the type of undertaking I have just outlined, the inquiry will be completed. However, where a registered teacher does not give an undertaking in regard to these matters, the inquiry will continue as if the request had not been made by the panel.  A hearing, if required, will be held in public by default unless the teacher or a witness, about whom personal matters may be disclosed at the inquiry, requests that all or part of the hearing is held in private and the panel is satisfied that it would be appropriate in the circumstances to do so. At the hearing the director, or any other person with leave of the panel, will present evidence in support of the complaint. Witnesses will give testimony on oath, and there will be the right to cross-examine witnesses and call evidence. The panel will be able to receive evidence given orally, by affidavit, or other means for example, video link. The panel will have the powers, rights and privileges vested in the High Court in respect of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and in respect of their examination on oath or otherwise, and can compel the production of documents. A witness will have the same immunities and privileges as if he or she were a witness before the High Court. For the purposes of the inquiry, a panel may, in accordance with the provisions of a new section 43A, consider information in a vetting disclosure and any submissions made in relation to that disclosure. I will outline the provisions of 43A when dealing with amendment No. 41. On completion of an inquiry, the panel may make no finding and dismiss the complaint. Otherwise, the panel will produce a report setting out the nature of the complaint, the evidence considered, the measures where a teacher has given an undertaking, where appropriate, and the panel’s findings. In addition, where the complaint relates to the conviction of the teacher of an offence triable by indictment, the panel must report whether the findings affect the teacher’s fitness to teach. The panel will also report any other matter it considers appropriate.  Under the Bill the Teaching Council itself may make a complaint under section 42 of the Act where it has received a vetting disclosure giving a bona fide concern that the teacher may harm any child or vulnerable person, cause any child or vulnerable person to be harmed, put any child or vulnerable person at risk of harm, attempt to harm any child or vulnerable person, or incite another person to harm any child or vulnerable person. In such circumstances, where the panel is satisfied that there is a risk, the panel in its report will specify the nature of the information disclosed in the vetting disclosure, the evidence, the panel’s assessment of the risk, and its conclusion in respect of that risk. Where it is not satisfied there is a risk the panel may dismiss the complaint. Where a complaint is dismissed, the complainant, the teacher concerned, such other persons as the teacher may request, and the teacher’s employer will be informed. At the request of the teacher, the panel will publish a notice to that effect. This amendment involves the deletion of the current section 17, which also provided for amendments to the provisions for an inquiry. However, amendment No. 40 is more comprehensive than section 17. Amendment No. 44 amends section 44 of the Act and provides that it is the panel rather than the full disciplinary committee, which, having completed its report, determines what measures, if any, are to be taken to sanction a teacher. The original Bill provided for the full disciplinary committee to have this function. The amendment ensures consistency between sections 43 and 44. This approach is being taken on foot of legal advice received by my Department. Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment consequent on Amendment No. 40, which replaces section 43. Amendments Nos. 45 to 48, inclusive, replace the term "disciplinary committee" with "panel". The purpose of these amendments is to ensure consistency of language in section 44 of the principal Act, as amended, which provides that the panel rather than the disciplinary committee shall determine what measures, if any, to take to sanction a teacher following the panel's report.

The 2001 Act already provides that panels would conduct inquiries on behalf of the committee, and the revised wording strengthens references in the Act to the role of the panels. Section 28 of the principal Act provides for membership of the disciplinary committee and removes the provisions that the director will be secretary to the disciplinary committee and that the chairperson of the Teaching Council will be a member and chairperson of the disciplinary committee. These changes are proposed on foot of legal advice received by the Department pertaining to separation of duties in terms of governance roles and the conduct of disciplinary inquiries. The legal advice indicates it is more appropriate that the chair of the council would not be a member of the disciplinary committee. Amendment No. 8 proposes that the council shall select eight rather than seven members who are registered teachers elected to the council or nominated by trade unions to make up the disciplinary committee. The number is being increased to make up for the removal of the chairperson. Amendment No. 50 amends section 44(2)(a) of the Bill, as amended in the Dáil, and provides that the disciplinary committee rather than the director shall advise relevant parties of the decision of a disciplinary panel following an inquiry. This is consistent with the removal of the requirement for the director to act as secretary to the committee. A further technical amendment to section 44 is required to provide for the status of the decision of the High Court regarding an appeal. I will propose such an amendment on Report Stage.

This also frees up the director to be the presenting officer for cases, which is a more appropriate role.

It also makes consistent the reference in the Act to whether the registration is subject to conditions under various sections, such as conditions that may be applied at the initial registration stage. The amendment provides that where the council prescribes the information to be included in the register, such information shall, in addition to the information set out in the Bill and the Act, include the name and address of the employer if known to the council, the findings of any disciplinary proceedings under Part 5, including any measures confirmed by a panel under section 44(1)(a), and the period for which such information shall remain on the register. These updates are important to ensure the register provides comprehensive information on a teacher's registration status.

The Teaching Council has been conducting a review of this matter, which Senator Healy Eames raised yesterday. Why is the regulation no longer considered acceptable? I have BA and MA qualifications but I am most proud of my qualification in Montessori education because it gave me such useful skills in child-centred developmental education. The primary school sector followed the work of Dr. Maria Montessori by introducing child-centred education. I hope the regulation will not be removed. It was put in place to take account of Montessori teachers. I want to hear a good reason for excluding them from the register. Students take a four-year degree course to qualify as Montessori teachers. This qualification was not even available when the regulation was put in place. The council has acknowledged that no phase of teacher education would be sufficient to address all the needs of pupils but not all types of training are equal. One cannot say that a degree in one subject is more valuable than another. The child is paramount to education, and the child always comes first in Montessori education. I ask the Minister's views on the regulation, which I think is required.

I agree wholeheartedly with the Teaching Council's view that teachers are fully qualified particularly in the area of special education. I have seen people come straight out of college and into a special education class, sometimes with no experience. This happens in mainstream as well. I have called for a long time for strict modules on working on special education which should be brought into special education classes and schools. It has nothing to do with Montessori.

The issue of having different rules is the question the Teaching Council was concerned about, that we should, in some way, say there is a different standard in terms of qualification. The issue of Montessori is one on which I would like to engage again with the Teaching Council. I have personal experience in this area as does the Senator. In the whole area of early childhood education, Montessori is considered to be a highly valued qualification. The question is, and it is one on which there are differing opinions, whether in terms of the primary school and the post-primary school, which come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills, one should have different qualifications for special schools as opposed to mainstream schools. The Teaching Council has taken a view that it does not want to say that certain things are acceptable in one type of school and not in another but it is an issue that needs further consideration.

The amendment is necessary in order to correct a cross reference in that subsection to subsection (4A) of the same section. Section 33 deals with renewal of registration and subsection (4A) of section 33, as amended by this Bill, is concerned with the council notifying a teacher of its intention to seek a vetting disclosure for the purpose of renewal of registration and was amended on Committee Stage in the Dáil. As a result of that amendment, the cross reference to (4A) in subsection (4) required correcting. In making this correction, subsection (4) along with the relevant provision within (4A) has been reworded to make clearer in the Bill that an application for renewal of registration may be made prior to the expiry of that person's registration subject to the person having complied, within the required timeframe for same, with any requirement for vetting that has arisen for the purposes of renewal of his or her registration. Government amendment No. 16 amends subsection (4A) in line with the changed wording in subsection (4). These amendments do not alter the effect of the existing provisions but simply make clearer the requirement to comply with vetting where it arises. It is not intended that all teachers will be vetted on each annual renewal of registration. This amendment makes clear that when a vetting requirement arises in respect of a person's renewal of registration, that teacher must comply with that requirement within the timeframe specified by the council.  I inform the House that I intend, subject to legal advice, to make further amendments to section 33 of the 2001 Act on Report Stage. These will involve providing for the following: where the Teaching Council receives a vetting disclosure for the purposes of the renewal of a teacher's registration and the information in that disclosure gives rise to a bona fide
child or vulnerable person protection concern, the Teaching Council may, after giving that teacher an opportunity to make representations in relation to same, provide that teacher's employer with a copy of the vetting disclosure concerned; and the council may refuse to renew a teacher's registration at his or her next annual renewal where that teacher has not consented to a vetting disclosure being obtained under the Bill's fitness to teach provisions and the council is not satisfied that there are valid and bona fide reasons for the teacher's refusal to consent to such a vetting request. This provision will be subject to the council giving the teacher concerned an opportunity to make representations to it in this regard and the council having considered any such representation received. I also intend to amend section 33 of the 2001 Act further to provide that in exceptional circumstances where, notwithstanding that a registered teacher has co-operated with a vetting requirement in the context of the annual renewal of his or her registration, a vetting disclosure has not been received from the bureau prior to the expiry of the teacher's registration, or it has been received but there has been insufficient time for the council to obtain and consider any submissions required in respect of that disclosure, the council may extend the person's registration for a limited time. The timeline for such an extension will be subject to the council making a decision in respect of that person's registration within 21 days after the receipt of the disclosure concerned or where the disclosure contains information of relevance to that person's registration, the council having invited submissions from the person within 21 days of receipt of that disclosure and making a decision in respect of that person's registration within 21 days of receipt of such submissions.  Further, I intend to amend section 33, to state explicitly that a teacher who appeals to the High Court the decision of the Teaching Council not to renew his or her registration will remain on the register during the period of appeal, other than where the Teaching Council considers it is in the public interest otherwise and where the council has consequently made an application to the High Court for an order to suspend the teacher from the register under section 47.  I also intend to amend section 33 such that, following a High Court decision on an appeal, a teacher or the Teaching Council can make a further appeal to the Court of Appeal on a specified question of law. This is to provide for extra time where there is a High Court case or time is needed for the person to get on to the register. That will be dealt with on Report Stage.

This amendment was discussed at length in the other House. This provision is needed to ensure that only serious cases go to hearings. This principle was upheld in the Corbally judgment in the Supreme Court. The amendment seeks to insert only the word "serious" into the provision. If we err on the side of caution what is the problem with inserting this word? I want to ensure that only serious cases go to hearings. Given that many teachers would be vulnerable to frivolous and vexatious complaints there is a need to tighten the provision to ensure that only serious cases go before the courts.

Legal advice was obtained to assist in the Bill's preparation with regard to this specific issue. Arising from this consideration and our consultation with the Attorney General's office, I believe it is neither necessary nor appropriate to include the word "serious" as proposed in the amendment. The current wording is in line with similar provisions in other regulatory legislation. There are several stages to the fitness to teach process, which will provide protection against less serious matters proceeding to an inquiry. This was a point we considered in some detail in earlier stages of the debate in light of the Corbally case, referred to by Senator Reilly. To get to the point of a hearing, there will be several examinations of the complaint. If the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, made in bad faith or an abuse of process, the director may refuse it. Subsequently, the investigating committee screens on the basis of a number of criteria and must be satisfied that there is a prima facie case to warrant further action before referring the complaint to the disciplinary committee. The complaint will not get to the point of a hearing until various thresholds are met. Any complaint that gets to the point of a hearing will be a serious complaint. It will fall to the council, as the self-regulator of the profession, to determine which cases proceed and how they are managed. However, in doing so, the council has the benefit of established case law and the experience of other professional regulators which make clear that there must be a level of seriousness in any conduct or performance issue before a decision can be made to proceed to an inquiry and before consequential sanctions can be made against the teacher. The Teaching Council will operate its powers under the Act in a manner that fully protects the rights of persons involved in a Part 5 process and in a manner consistent with the Supreme Court judgment in the Corbally case as well as other relevant case law and the council's legal advice. The Bill provides for appeal to the High Court on foot of decisions made following a fitness to teach inquiry, which is another important protection for teachers. I am satisfied, therefore, that the wording as set out in the Bill is appropriate. As I said, we have consulted the Office of the Attorney General on the matter and have taken into consideration corresponding provisions in existing regulatory legislation. We have considered the union's concerns in this area. On top of what I have outlined in respect of the various processes before the process gets to a hearing, the council will be required to review the operation of the fitness to teach provisions after three years.

If a teacher has agreed to measures as part of an inquiry, it makes sense that non-compliance with the measures can be followed up. This is the same structure that applies for other regulators. Section 42(1)(g), dealing with conviction for an offence, is already in the Bill. On Report Stage I intend to amend the fitness to teach provisions in Part 5 of the 2001 Act, subject to legal advices, to provide that failure to consent to vetting where a vetting disclosure is sought in accordance with the Bill's fitness to teach provisions may also constitute grounds for complaint under the Bill's fitness to teach provisions.

That section sets out the grounds on which complaints about registered teachers may be made and the role and processes to be followed by the director and the investigating committee in respect of such complaints. Section 42(1D), as amended by the Bill, provides that the council may make a complaint to the investigating committee where a vetting disclosure, obtained in its conduit role for school employers, gives rise to a bona fide child protection concern. Amendment No. 25 inserts a new subsection (1E) into section 42 and makes clear the council may also make a complaint to the investigating committee under the existing provisions of section 42(1)(g), where a disclosure obtained in its conduit role contains information relating to a criminal conviction. Under the Bill as it stands, section 42(1)(g) provides that a complaint may be made in respect of a registered teacher on the grounds “that he or she has been convicted in the State of an offence triable on indictment or convicted outside the State of an offence consisting of acts or omissions that, if done or made in the State, would constitute an offence triable on indictment”. Amendment No. 25 makes clear that such a complaint may be made by the council where a vetting disclosure obtained in its conduit role for school employers contains information about a conviction of this nature. Amendments Nos. 28, 31 and 36 are linked to amendment No. 25. Amendment No. 28 makes clear that where the council, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Bill, makes a complaint in respect of information contained in a vetting disclosure that it has obtained in its conduit role, it shall provide the director with a copy of the vetting disclosure concerned and shall indicate the information within that disclosure which grounds the complaint. Amendment No. 31 makes clear that the director may, in the case of such complaints and for the purpose of considering whether to refuse or to refer such a complaint to the investigating committee, consider the information in the disclosure in so far as it relates to the complaint in question. Amendment No. 36 replaces section 33(7), as amended by the Bill, with revised wording to incorporate additional provisions that set out more comprehensively the requirements on the investigating committee when dealing with the aforementioned complaints. This new subsection (7) has been amended to provide that, in addition to providing the teacher concerned with a copy of the complaint and other information and documentation accompanying the complaint, the investigating committee shall provide a copy of the vetting disclosure to the teacher concerned where the complaint has been made by the council in respect of information in that disclosure, and for the teacher to be invited to make submissions in respect of that vetting disclosure. This amendment also makes clear that the investigating committee may consider the information in a disclosure in so far as that information relates to the complaint made by the council and may consider any submissions made by the teacher relating to that disclosure.

In this regard, the Bill refers to a “complaint” under section 42, whereas the 2001 Act referred to an “application” or “appeal”. It also deletes the provision at section 42(5)(b)(iii) to the effect that the investigating committee shall refuse to consider a complaint where there is insufficient evidence to warrant an investigation. The purpose of this change is to guard against the danger that a complaint must be refused, even if of a serious nature, where there is little evidence available or where it is not straightforward to determine if the evidence is sufficient. It would not be desirable for a situation to develop where there is a danger that a complaints is forced to be abandoned too early in the process and before an informed decision can be made on whether it merits an inquiry.

This new section 43A sets outs separately the relevant provisions of the Bill relating to the use and assessment of vetting disclosure by a panel undertaking an inquiry under section 43.In addition to the provisions which were previously in Schedule 3, additional provisions in subsections 7 and 8 of this new section makes clear that a panel may also consider information in a vetting disclosure where the council has made a complaint, under the relevant provisions of section 42, in respect of that information, and that the panel can consider information in that disclosure only in so far as it grounds that complaint and relates to the conduct which is the subject of the complaint. It also allows the panel to consider any submissions that the teacher may have made in respect of that vetting disclosure.

In addition, it is an offence if a person does anything which, if the panel were a court of law, would be contempt of court. The amendment provides that a person who commits an offence will be liable on summary conviction to a class C fine. These matters were already included as offences in the 2001 Act but references need to be updated to reflect that it is the panel which is conducting the inquiry and making decisions. The inclusion of "a class C fine" in place of a fine of "£1,905" updates this provision in accordance with the more current legislative approach.

Concerns have been raised with me about whether it will be a religious oath or one that would be broad and would cater for those of religious faith and none. What type of oath will teachers be required to take?

This is to prevent a situation where the investigating committee or a disciplinary panel are obliged to proceed with a complaint even if it has been withdrawn and the committee or panel sees no reason to proceed. Of course, the committee or panel may also decide to proceed if that is deemed appropriate.

Amendment No. 49 is necessary to provide that, in such circumstances, the panel will make a decision to confirm those measures. Amendment No. 52 ensures that such decisions, which are arrived at on foot of a voluntary agreement by the teacher, are not subject to an application by the Teaching Council to the High Court for confirmation of the decision.

The amendment provides that measures entered into by a teacher voluntarily are not appealable to the High Court. The amendment deletes the words "of the Disciplinary Committee" from the phrase "vary the decision of the Disciplinary Committee". It is considered that these words are unnecessary in the context of the purpose of this section.

The amendment further provides for the Teaching Council, where it has reached a decision to sanction a teacher, to inform the appropriate body in another jurisdiction of that decision, where it has reason to believe the teacher is registered in that jurisdiction and that the body may not be aware of the decision.

The amendment also provides that the council may also publish the inquiry panel's report, its findings, its decision or the transcript of the inquiry. Information identifying a party to the inquiry may be redacted. I would also like to inform the House that I intend, on Report Stage, subject to legal advices and to compatibility with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, to amend section 46B to provide that reports, findings or transcripts, as appropriate, or parts thereof, in respect of complaints made by the council itself on foot of information in a vetting disclosure obtained in the council's conduit role for employers, may be published.

It does not apply, however, where a person commits an offence in respect of a panel inquiry. The proposed amendment follows the form of non-admissibility provisions in more recent legislation than the original Teaching Council Act.

The amendment proposes the replacement of Schedule 3 to the principal Act. Much of the detail of Schedule 3 to the principal Act is now dealt with in the proposed amendment to section 43. Accordingly, this is essentially a structural amendment, and all of its provisions already exist in the principal Act. Acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 21 of the Bill, which included the provisions for the panel which are now included in the proposed amendment to section 43.

“Review of operation of Act
24. The Minister shall—(a) not later than 2 years after this section comes into operation, commence a review of the operation of this Act, and(b) not later than 12 months after its commencement, make a report to each House of the Oireachtas of the findings made on the review and of the conclusions drawn from the findings.".This amendment provides that there will be a facility to review the operation of the Act after two years and, then, that a report be made to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the findings of the review. This is an important amendment. It is good practice to review legislation, particularly new legislation which gives new powers in regard to personal information and where many practices are being changed. It is a good idea that we would review the legislation to ensure it is fulfilling the purpose for which it was designed and to make sure we are doing things right.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-07 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	286	This amendment was also considered in the Dáil and I have referred to having a review of Part 5 after three years following discussions with the teaching unions. What we are doing by way of this Bill is amending the original legislation upon which the council is based. The main purposes of the Bill under consideration are to underpin the Teaching Council's statutory functions in regard to Garda vetting of teachers, to strengthen and clarify the council's teaching arrangements and to make consequential amendments. There is a comprehensive suite of provisions for ongoing oversight of the implementation of the Teaching Council Act and operations of the Teaching Council. The Teaching Council also publishes an annual report which is laid before the Houses each year. As I said, I am aware of the concerns and fears of teachers regarding aspects of the operation of the fitness to teach provisions of Part 5. My officials have had a number of very helpful meetings with the teacher unions in this regard. It is true to say that similar concerns relating to various legal rights - for example, privacy, reputation, fairness and rights of appeal - are shared across all professions.We are fortunate we have available to us a substantial body of knowledge and good practice in the way other regulated professions have approached these issues both here and in similar jurisdictions. Recent court judgments too indicate clear boundaries within which regulatory bodies such as the Teaching Council operate. On the basis of the advice available to my Department, it is clear that only serious professional matters can be considered under the fitness to teach provisions. However, all legislation needs to be kept under review in case something is not working in accordance with the intention during its passage. I with my officials have given some consideration to the point that a timeframe might be put in place in respect of a review of the Act, with a view to addressing any issues that might arise in terms of implementation of the Act that possibly could be addressed at an earlier stage. Accordingly I will be asking the council to review the operation of Part 5, three years following its commencements and to submit advice to my Department on any policy issue arising that might require further legislative attention.  I suppose that goes some way to addressing the concerns of Senator Reilly.
