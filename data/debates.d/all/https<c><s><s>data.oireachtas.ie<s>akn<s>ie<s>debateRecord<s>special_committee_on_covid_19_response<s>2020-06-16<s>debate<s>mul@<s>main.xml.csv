The following meetings have been agreed. We will have two sessions on Thursday this week where we will resume our examination of the Covid outbreaks in nursing homes and in the afternoon, we will examine the impact of the pandemic on the Gaeltacht areas. The meeting will be addressed by the Minister of State, Seán Kyne. Next Tuesday, we will deal with issues relating to childcare and on Thursday we will have a meeting specifically on testing and tracing capabilities. We are also seeking approval from the Business Committee to have up to six sessions per week which may mean sitting on Fridays and we will start the examination of the return to education, including school transport. Is that agreed? Agreed. I have arranged for Deputy Mary Butler to chair the second session today, and I will chair the third.

In the Dáil Chamber we will be joined by Dr. Eddie Casey, chief economist and head of secretariat and by video link from abroad by the following members of the Council: Mr. Sebastian Barnes, acting chairperson, and council members Ms Dawn Holland and Professor Michael McMahon. I can see everyone at least, which is a good start. Remote witnesses will have received a note on privilege. There is a constitutional ambiguity on the degree of privileges which remote witnesses enjoy. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 186 that the committee should refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. We expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour. Nevertheless, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol. If they have any concerns in that regard, I ask them to bring them to my attention immediately. I invite Mr. Barnes to make his opening statement and to please limit it to five minutes. That is what we usually do. His statement has been circulated.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	12	The council would like to thank the Chair and members of the committee for inviting us today. As you noted, Chairman, I am joined today by my council colleagues, Ms Dawn Holland and Professor Michael McMahon, and we are joined in the Chamber by our chief economist, Dr. Eddie Casey, and also by Mr. Kevin Timoney, an economist on the fiscal council. Engagement with the Oireachtas is an extremely important part of the council's work, including with the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in the previous Dáil. The council is an independent body established under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012. Its mandate is to endorse and assess the Government's macroeconomic forecasts and its budgetary projections, and compliance with the fiscal rules and the fiscal stance. It is important to note that the council's mandate is about the overall budgetary position rather than on individual tax measures or spending items. The Covid-19 crisis has had a huge impact on Ireland and internationally. Even in the first three months of the year, consumer spending is down by approximately 5%. Underlying domestic demand is expected to contract by between 7% and 17% this year. Approximately 26% of the workforce is currently either unemployed or on pandemic unemployment supports. The council's fiscal assessment report, published on 27 May, provides an assessment of the fiscal impact of Covid-19. There is exceptionally high uncertainty at the moment about the health outcomes and the economic outcomes. To assess this, in the fiscal assessment report the council has outlined three scenarios to 2025 to help people's thinking about this. In the "mild" scenario, conditions improve rapidly and lasting damage to the economy is limited. The "central" scenario builds on the official forecasts in the stability programme update, SPU, published by the Government in April. It is assumed that confinement measures are eased as planned, but with lasting impacts. In a "severe" scenario, there are repeated lockdowns and wider financial distress. These scenarios do not take into account major risks Ireland faces from Brexit or from corporation tax. In all scenarios, activity falls sharply and the crisis will have a lasting effect. The scenarios imply it would take two and a half to three years for the economy to return to pre-crisis levels of activity. By contrast, the economy took 11 years to recover after the financial crisis. In fiscal terms, the budget balance will move sharply into deficit this year; the SPU projected a deficit of 13% of GNI* this year, reflecting €7 billion of crisis-related spending and a much larger fall in tax revenue. This likely underestimates the impact on spending because it does not include the extension of support measures or any future fiscal stimulus package. While the fiscal balance will improve as the economy recovers, the central scenario implies that the deficit could still be approximately 3% of GNI* in 2025. The appropriate fiscal stance in response to this will evolve over the coming years in three broad phases. In phase 1, the immediate crisis, the Government should limit the negative impacts on health and on the economy. The council welcomes the measures taken to support the economy. These should continue as long as needed, although they may need to evolve to reflect changing needs. Phase 2 will be marked by the removal of most of the containment measures and the economy will begin to recover, but investment and consumer spending will remain very weak and unemployment will remain high. The council assesses that a sizeable fiscal stimulus would be warranted during this phase to help support the recovery. Borrowing to support weak demand would be an appropriate countercyclical response to manage the economy. It should be temporary, targeted and conditioned on the likely state of the economy. Public investment could play an important role. While some reprioritisation may be needed, at least maintaining the current level of spending would help support activity and boost long-term output.Excess capacity in the construction sector may create opportunities.  In phase 3, the economy will settle into a new steady-state growth path. At this stage, the debt-to-GNI* ratio will be very high. The debt ratio could be in the range of 115% to 145% in 2021, up from just below 100% in 2019. Given the very high level of debt and lower revenues, fiscal adjustment is likely to be required in phase 3 to put the debt-to-GNI* ratio on a downward path towards safer levels. A key factor is the low level of interest rates. Even with the higher debt level, interest payments could actually fall over the coming years in the central scenario due to lower interest rates and a favourable tailwind as existing debt is rolled over. The long maturity of new issuance provides some protection against a rise in rates over the coming years. However, low interest rates cannot be taken for granted. Actions by the European Central Bank and the stability of the euro area will be key. With a very high debt ratio, Ireland will ultimately be much more vulnerable to future changes in interest rates as large amounts of funding will likely be required for new borrowing in the coming years and to roll over existing debt. This is why it will be very important to use the current positive debt dynamics to bring debt to a safer level.  In terms of future fiscal adjustment, the council's analysis suggests that getting the debt-to-GNI* ratio to fall at a pace of 3% a year by 2025 - similar to previous plans - would require total adjustments ranging from €6 billion to €14 billion over the period from 2023 to 2025. In the central scenario of around €10 billion of adjustment, this could take place over several years and against the background of a growing economy. The adjustment would still be less than a third of what was implemented after the 2008 crisis. This does not mean a return to severe austerity. Fiscal adjustment will be needed but some upward and downward adjustments, either in aggregate terms or on specific items, are a normal part of budgetary management. The adjustment could be achieved to a large degree by growing spending at a slower pace than the economy grows. We do not expect to return to severe austerity in the sense of significant increases in unemployment due to fiscal adjustments taking place in a downturn as Ireland saw after 2008.  Any incoming Government will have to take difficult decisions about competing spending and tax priorities during this third phase against the background of required adjustment. Any new commitments will likely require reductions in other areas of spending or higher taxes. Nonetheless, ambitious policies can still be pursued in areas like health, housing and climate change. Three long-standing issues, however, will need to be addressed. The first is spending pressures associated with an ageing population. The council will publish a long-term stability report in July looking at these issues. Second, additional measures could be needed if Ireland is to meet its climate change commitments. Third, the State has become over-reliant on corporation tax receipts, which accounted for some 18% of annual tax receipts last year. To conclude, there are huge uncertainties for the economy depending on health outcomes but the broad phases of the crisis and recovery are relatively clear. As the economy exits lockdown, a sizeable fiscal stimulus would help recovery. However, some adjustments are likely to be needed down the line to get the debt ratio on a safe downward path again. To safeguard the funding of public services and supports in future, while addressing future challenges, the incoming Government should set a credible path for prudent fiscal policy and take steps to reinforce the budgetary framework. We look forward to members' questions.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	14	I welcome Mr. Barnes and his colleagues. On wage growth beyond 2021, the stability programme update suggests that after a decline this year, we will see wage inflation of 3.8% in 2021. What does the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council expect wage growth to average in the three years after 2021?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	15	It is our view that wage growth will be impacted by the crisis and it will then pick up. Perhaps Dr. Eddie Casey, our chief economist, can give the numbers.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	16	We expect wage growth of roughly 2% to 3% from 2022 up to 2025.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	17	So between 2% and 3%. I am interested in IFAC's view on the programme for Government that was published yesterday where it gives a clear commitment that where there is wage growth, there will be indexation of taxes and bands. This is something that has not happened in this State over the past decade. Wage inflation of 3% would mean tax forgone of in excess of €4 billion over the four-year period. What is IFAC's position on that given that the council is suggesting there could be an adjustment required of €7 billion in the later part of the Government's term?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	18	I can take that as well. If it is assumed that there is 2% to 3% wage inflation in the other years, then typically that would be associated with non-indexation increases in revenue of approximately €600 million per annum. If the tax system were not to be indexed, that is how much would be raised. If it were to be indexed, then that is how much it would presumably cost versus what would have been planned.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	19	Does IFAC accept that if there is indexing, and there is, as I said, a clear commitment for the first time in more than a decade to index tax rates, bands and credits, the tax forgone over that four-year period if we are to see the type of wage growth would be in excess of €4 billion?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	20	No, not necessarily. It depends when it starts. If it is in 2021-2022, then we are looking at three to four years of €600 million, which at a maximum would be €2.4 billion. It is not quite at the €4 billion range. It is really something for the Department to estimate. That is the kind of estimate that we usually would see from it.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	21	The commitment in the programme is starting from 2022. For every 1% of wage indexation to wage inflation, it costs €136 million. Therefore, if it were to take place over a four-year period, it would be €136 million by a factor of 30 which gives the €4 billion figure. Outside of where it is, because we know it will run into billions of euro, is that a prudent approach given the situation where the State is at? On what does the flexibility then rely in terms of reducing the deficit? Is it suppressing spending in public expenditure in areas such as health and housing where we know that there is also competing demand for resources?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	22	The council does not take any view on specific tax and spending measures or on whether indexation or increasing through non-indexation or through other means is the right thing to do. We do not have a view on that. However, it is relevant that, as we are discussing, the amounts that are being forgone by the commitment to index are quite substantial. It will potentially make it more difficult during a period where fiscal adjustment may be needed and where there are ambitious commitments on the spending side, for example, around health, to finance these in this uncertain environment when commitments on substantial parts of the tax systems or some other commitments have been made that will reduce the flexibility in balancing spending and taxation on the one hand and the sustainability of the public finances.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	23	I will ask Mr. Barnes about the stimulus that he believes is required and that IFAC believes is appropriate, because it is appropriate that we stimulate and try to grow the economy. What quantum of stimulus does Mr. Barnes believe would be appropriate this year and, indeed, over the next number of years? Particularly this year, what type of space is available and what would be appropriate?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	24	At this stage, it is a little too early to judge. There is a lot of uncertainty, both about what will happen on the health side and what will happen on the economic side. Reviewing these decisions during the budget, as is set out in the coalition programme, is the appropriate time to do that. In the fiscal assessment report, for illustrative purposes we took a total stimulus package of €10 billion. That would be enough to support the economy by approximately 3%. We would see that probably being spread over several years. This year, obviously, the measures would come in in the later part of the year. Therefore, most of the spending would be next year but perhaps some of it would be this year. We had pencilled in something like €3 billion this year, but this is all illustrative. It could be higher than that if the economy is weaker. It could be a bit less than that, obviously, if things work out better than expected.That should show the Deputy the order of magnitude of the sizeable programme over multiple years that we had in mind.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	25	What would Mr. Barnes say to the argument that this is a very modest stimulus given what the economy needs and given what is happening in other European jurisdictions? The total package in Germany is equivalent to 30% of its GDP. IBEC has argued for a package worth €22 billion. Many others have argued for stimulus packages well in excess of what IFAC has laid out.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	26	To be clear, this is an illustrative amount. It is important that the right amount is ultimately chosen. That right amount could easily be much larger than the number we have suggested. It is not supposed to limit the amount to be spent. The amount that needs to be spent will depend on how the economy is doing but it could well be in excess of the figure we have given. That would be appropriate and the right thing to do. The State has the fiscal space to do that.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	27	One of the best ways to stimulate the economy in terms of the return received is to invest in construction and other labour-heavy industries. Does Mr. Barnes believe that this would be an appropriate way to stimulate the economy? Are the concerns IFAC has expressed in the past with regard to capacity and so on valid in the current environment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	28	While we have not taken a specific view on how the stimulus should be structured, it is clear that public investment has a great multiplier effect economically. There are forms of such investment, including constructing and retrofitting housing, that are very labour intensive. It is likely that construction activity in both housing and commercial property will be badly hit by the crisis so there will be spare resources in those sectors. If all these things are put together, they show that there may well be opportunities with regard to construction. In the past, we have raised concerns about construction but that was in a period where capacity was very tight for both housing and, in particular, for commercial construction. That is no longer the case. As the circumstances have changed, policy would do well to adapt.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	29	On corporation tax, the IFAC document outlines that 50% of corporation tax receipts cannot be explained by the growth in the domestic economy. Is the council more concerned about corporation tax issues now than it was last year? Given that none of these projections take Brexit and the potential cliff edge at the end of the year into account, has anything in recent weeks increased the council's concerns in regard to Brexit? These issues are all somewhat connected. Do the Exchequer returns we have seen, which showed a higher proportion of corporation tax than was expected and a smaller drop-off in income tax than was expected, with a €500 million boost there, change the council's view with regard to the overall deficit? I believe IFAC still projects that it will be €23 billion whereas the Central Bank is talking about €28 billion. I believe it will be in excess of €30 billion at the end of the year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	30	I will let Professor McMahon come in on the Brexit questions in a moment, if he would like to do so. I will answer the other two points. The Exchequer returns confirmed much of what we see in the economy. It was striking that VAT and excise taxes were down by approximately 20%. That is a good reflection of what is happening in the economy. With regard to other tax heads such as income tax, when one is doing a comparison year on year, which is how we tend to do these things, one sees a lot of growth between May of last year and February of this year. It does not quite show up in the numbers, but we expect those tax heads to decrease very steeply. With regard to the projection of a deficit of €23 billion included in the SPU, it was a good figure at the time but, as I noted in my opening comments, given that there has been an extension of some of the programmes and that stimulus measures are likely, it is almost certainly an underestimate. To be fair, spending has been a little bit lower than expected in some areas but I do not believe that will make a great deal of net difference. The Deputy is right that the deficit figure is likely to be higher than the SPU figure, which was partly allowed for.In terms of the risk around corporation tax, I would not say that I am more worried than I was when we last spoke six months ago. Corporation tax can be affected by two things. One is the state of the domestic economy, which will push down a lot on corporation tax as many companies are facing very hard times. It will be interesting to see what happens to the multinational sector. As ever, that is very volatile and hard to predict, but it may be that the multinational sector remains relatively strong. That would be a good thing at a time other Government revenues are suffering. However, in the long run, it is not a sustainable solution for financing the public finances. It will be important, despite all the competing pressures in the years ahead, that the over-reliance on corporation tax is addressed and does not get any worse over the coming years. I will hand over to Professor McMahon.

Yes. We are quite constrained by the time we can be in the Chamber. I ask everybody to be as concise as possible. I call Deputy Carroll MacNeill.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	33	I thank the witnesses for attending. I want to take them through some of the issues in their report and ask a number of questions. I am getting a lot of calls from people and I am aware of a concern generally about moving into a recessionary period, what that means and how it will contrast with the previous recessionary period, which was difficult for everybody and lasted a long time. I would like the witnesses' insight into how this is different, the reasons for that and how we work through it. For example, the report presents a range of scenarios of various severity and implies that it would take two to three and a half years to return to pre-crisis levels of economic activity. By contrast, the economy took 11 years to recover after the previous financial crisis. What are the assumptions behind that and the reasons such different periods of recovery are identified?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	34	When trying to assess what type of economic slowdown or recession we are experiencing now, the key thing is to recognise that at least in the first instance, the economic slowdown is itself a public health measure. Lockdown and isolation of large parts of the economy has been done with the objective of protecting public health. As a result, it is a very different form of recession from those we have seen in the past. As we discuss in the report, that does not mean it will not have ongoing effects. In particular, there are certain sectors of the economy that, even if lockdown were to end in some legal sense, would not adjust back to their previous levels at any speed. As Mr. Barnes outlined in his opening statement, the report examines three scenarios. They are not in any way meant to be the only possible scenarios. There is massive uncertainty about this. The point we stress about why this would be a faster recovery than we saw after the financial crisis is that, in terms of both household and corporate balance sheets and the fiscal position, Ireland went into this crisis in a much healthier state. Of course, the challenges that have come from the Covid-19 pandemic are such that large areas of the economy, a broad cross section of industries, and a broad cross section of different types of households have been adversely affected. That is why in this initial health phase, the "whatever it takes" type support the Government has been pursuing is something we absolutely endorse. How we recover from this will itself depend on some things that are very hard to ascertain.For instance, at what rate will people decide they are confident enough to go back to shopping in non-essential shops or start to re-engage with the entertainment industries, for example, by going to pubs or restaurants? How these behavioural responses play out will depend on many aspects that are just very difficult to ascertain. Nonetheless, across the phases we believe Ireland is pretty well placed so that most of the sectors can recover. As Mr. Barnes outlined, with some fiscal stimulus in the second phase, that is, in the recovery phase after the initial health impact has been mitigated somewhat, Ireland could be back in approximately two and a half to three years, which, as the Deputy noted, is much faster.
#JenniferCarrollMacNeill	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-party	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-dob	unknown-#JenniferCarrollMacNeill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	35	The professor stated that the reason is we have gone into this recessionary period with our public finances in a completely different position from where they had been. People are concerned, however, even though it has given us a platform to borrow to be able to fund the sort of expenditure we need, both in terms of ongoing weekly payments and the sort of stimulus plan that the professor is talking about, which is envisaged by the incoming Government to be delivered in July, and we will come back to that. On the level of borrowing and where we are with interest rates, how long can we borrow before we get to the point of a threat to credibility? In NTMA papers from 2014, one can see how catastrophic the bond yield position was in 2010 and 2011, arising from all the uncertainty about the then Government generally, default and the general position of our credibility on the international markets. I do not think we will get back to that point, fortunately, but there has to come a point at which we cannot continue to borrow credibly without showing we will be able to correct it. What is the professor's sense of that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	36	It is a very difficult question to answer but the point I would stress is the role the European Central Bank and other authorities are playing in providing support for the bond market. Nominal yields are at all-time lows in many countries, and as Mr. Barnes outlined, even in the scenarios that look much weaker than they did at the time of the previous budget, the interest payments, at least for now, are projected to fall over that period. The Deputy rightly asked whether there is a trigger value whereby, at 120% or 130%, all of this will change. We just do not know that. Much will depend on the ongoing levels of support that come from the European Central Bank and the European Commission. We believe that the appropriate response is to provide the support now in phase 1 and equally to provide some stimulus in phase 2, but by phase 3 and beyond, there will be a need to bring the debt dynamics back to a more sustainable path. The good thing-----

It is a bit like what the professor was saying about trying to predict the speed of the recovery based on the behavioural economics of whether people will feel comfortable about returning to entertainment, shopping or other activities. There is just a great deal that we do not yet know. I accept that our guest does not want to be too specific about what the July stimulus package should contain but I wish to talk about it in terms of sectors. Should it be driven in a sectoral way, such as at tourism or retail? Has the professor any sense of the structure of it, even if not the specifics?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	38	We do not have a specific view. One of the conditions of stimulus is that it should be targeted as much as possible, and I think the approach the Deputy laid out is sensible. Some sectors will get through this crisis quite quickly or will recover fast, whereas tourism or those that depend on people's behaviour and confidence in going out are likely to be weaker for much longer. A big issue is tourism and whether people will be willing to fly to Ireland and in what numbers. The Deputy is correct that an approach that is in some ways targeted would be constructive.

I hear what he is saying in respect of the repurposing of labour that had been dedicated to commercial space construction, but we are looking at a stimulus package that will, presumably, include significant capital expenditure on infrastructure projects by the State.Is that the only assumption behind that statement or is there anything else there?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	40	No, it is very much as the Deputy said. In fact, it is almost part of the targeting. We do not really know what is going to happen to private housing or to commercial real estate. There is a chance that the positive dynamics that Ireland experienced over the past couple of years will be impaired as a result of this crisis for some time. That will create this pool of labour and skills. It is obviously much better that they are used to do something that contributes to the welfare of the country than for those resources to be lying idle.

Could the reverse occur now? Could the excess commercial space that has been developed now be retrofitted or repurposed into residential space?

Will he accept, however, that the microeconomic difficulties are there to a far greater extent because of the debt burden being carried by the SME sector arising from that crash? Accordingly, its ability to recover after Covid-19 will be far more difficult and will require far greater funding.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	45	We have not looked specifically at the SME sector. However, there is a logic to what the Deputy said in the sense that some of these legacy issues from the previous crisis that were still around when we went into this will make it more complicated to recover. The main thing that is striking is that, compared to the previous downturn, we think it will be much less long lived. It has been much more violent to start with. Within a process of a few weeks, the economy was locked down. One could not go to a shop or a restaurant because they were literally closed by Government order. That is very different to what happened in the financial crisis. During the financial crisis, there was a big drop in demand. While it was not as sudden as this, it was ultimately much more longer lasting. It is that point which is going to cause many difficulties for firms, which literally have not been able to operate for a couple of months and may not be able to do business for a while. That is going to put huge pressure on the SME sector in particular, which often struggles to get access to finance. Their balance sheets are often not in such a good position, partly because of past issues, but also just because that is how the SME sector works. It is a concern for the recovery.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	46	I am surprised that Mr. Barnes has not factored in the SME performance relative to the debt that it is carrying from the past into the modelling for the recovery nationally and the creation of jobs, to which all of this is linked. I have the view that it will take the SME sector far longer to recover and the length and the type of recovery will depend completely on the level of supports it will receive through the stimulus packages. For example, it is important to acknowledge the past as being extremely difficult in terms of the SMEs and this recovery. Accordingly, the stimulus package, rather than being €10 billion, should be more realistic and use the IBEC suggestion of €22 billion. Again, there is a big gap between the €10 billion suggested by Mr. Barnes and the €22 billion being asked for. When people look for a more refined view of the economy, of the SME sector and the business sector generally, that is too much of a gap, even in terms of forecasting.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	47	We have not done a specific analysis of the SMEs. However, when one looks at our work between the central scenario and the severe scenario, one of the points that could make the difference between those two is actually how much damage is done to the SME sector.We have not done an in-depth analysis of that, but we will certainly take a closer look at it because, as the Deputy correctly stated, it is important. It could make the difference between a more normal recovery and a recovery that takes a long time.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	48	May I suggest that it will also make a difference in regard to the value of the stimulus package, which is to cost between €10 billion and €22 billion? If the council had the analysis, it might feed more favourably into the political policy on the recovery and the business sector. Could Mr. Barnes give us a timeline, in years, for phases 1, 2 and 3?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	49	On the stimulus and the SME issue, the severe scenario is one in which some of the effects the Deputy is talking about turn out to be relatively important. With regard to the value of the stimulus, as I noted earlier, the €10 billion was just an illustrative figure. It would not surprise me if it were far higher than that but the time to judge how big it should be will be later in the year, particularly around the budget. It is very uncertain. As the Deputy acknowledged, there is a huge difference between €10 billion and €22 billion. I am not taking a view particularly as to which of the figures is correct but the difference is big. The judgment needs to be made with all the available information at hand. I do not believe we have that today. The figure is only illustrative. If it were much bigger, it would not surprise me. It would not necessarily be a concern for the council. On the phases, much depends on which of the scenarios we end up in, be it the mild scenario, the severe scenario or somewhere in between. Taking the central scenario, which might be sensible, phase 1 is really now and in the short term, phase 2 would really be the recovery phase, which would be in the next couple of years, and phase 3, which is the new normal, might be from approximately 2023. Thinking about it in those terms, one notes the third phase is really a couple of years away. This corresponds with what we see in the coalition agreement that was published yesterday. Phase 1 really corresponds to the recovery fund. One can think about phase 2 as being a national economic programme, to be announced in the autumn and which will apparently have strong elements of investment and stimulus. Phase 3 really comes down to the roadmap, which will also be announced. It will set out how the Government intends to return to something close to balance by 2025. One can really see a correspondence between what is in the programme and the three phases we have outlined. The timing may vary a little but I hope the numbers I have given the Deputy give a reasonable idea of the timeline in years.

He said the phases relate to the programme. There is nothing really factual in the programme in terms of costs. Therefore, we do not know where that programme will end up or, indeed, how much of it will be implemented. That is a concern where taxes are concerned because there is a commitment to no increase in taxes. If there is to be no increase in taxes, and if we are to continue borrowing, could Mr Barnes tell us in layman's language how much we owe now, what we will owe at the end of this year and next year, and how it will be paid for?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	51	That is a good question.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	57	It would involve adding many billions each year. Perhaps Dr. Casey has the numbers.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	58	This year, it looks like it will be in the order of €14 billion. The nominal amount for next year is another €14 billion.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	60	Yes, €14 billion each year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	62	No, it is on top of that. The Deputy raised a good question relating to the programme.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	63	I still want clarity on this, please. Including all the stimulus packages, the input into Sláintecare, the €2.5 billion, and the fact that we are spending €1.60 for every euro of tax that we collect, how much will the national debt increase above €200 billion each year for the next three years, loosely? Dr. Casey says it will be €14 billion plus something. What is the extra?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	64	It depends on when Sláintecare is introduced. Over its life, it is expected to add about €3 billion annually to regular expenditure. We do not know how that will be phased in as a new programme for spending, which will cost approximately €2.5 billion to €3 billion each year. The Deputy made two points earlier about SME credit. Going into this crisis, we were nowhere near the level of indebtedness that we saw at the peak of 2007. We are back to levels that we would have seen in the early 2000s. SMEs are not as indebted as we saw at the end of the credit bubble and property bubble in the 2000s. They are not in as severe a situation going into this crisis as they were in 2007.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	65	Dr. Casey is the economist but I am the practitioner. I would dispute that figure. SMEs came in to us and made it perfectly clear that they required substantial free money to deal with their indebtedness, and most of it has been brought forward from previous years. To give them half a chance at recovery, we need Dr. Casey's figures to impress on Government that it has to support the SME sector, especially the micro sector.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	66	At the peak of their indebtedness, the outstanding debt of SMEs, excluding the financial sector, where there were many distortions, was close to 100% of the annual output in the economy. Going into this crisis, it is only about one fifth of that, at 20% of GNI*.

In the statement provided today was the phrase, "Three longstanding issues will need to be addressed." I have questions about this part. It reads:First, spending pressures associated with an ageing population will increase. The Council will publish a "Long-Term Stability Report" in July looking at these issues. Second, additional measures could be needed if Ireland is to meet its climate-change commitments. Third, the State has become over-reliant on corporation tax receipts, which accounted for over 18 per cent of annual tax receipts last year.If we work backwards, starting with corporation tax, I am interested in what the witnesses believe the correct split of corporation tax should be. The only way to lower this number is through lower corporation tax or increasing other taxes to introduce new taxes. Has the council given any consideration to how this might be done or how we might achieve a better balance in corporation tax? Do the witnesses believe that there would be any impact on corporation tax if we were to introduce country-by-country reporting?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	68	The issue of corporation tax, as the Deputy points out, is a long-standing concern. It has increased in recent years as the share of taxation coming from corporation tax has increased. With regard to how it is managed, there are two matters to consider. One that we have proposed in the past is that unexpected positive surprises from corporation tax should be set aside and saved rather than spent, which has been the case over recent years. That is to avoid the State building up permanent spending commitments on the basis of this tax, which is very volatile and may be somewhat fragile. It also ultimately requires an adjustment to move away from that. That either involves reductions in spending elsewhere or increases in other forms of taxes to reduce that vulnerability.One of the vulnerabilities is that the companies themselves might not do as well or might decide to move somewhere else, which they can do fairly easily. The other vulnerability is the possibility of changes in the international tax environment, which is partly to do with processes such as the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process and a number of other discussions. Ultimately, it is likely that this issue will correct, and it would be good to anticipate that rather than face it as another economic shock like the sorts of shocks we have seen lately.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	70	No, we do not.

I am happy to see that cited, but what measures is Mr. Barnes referring to? Is he referring to borrowing, taxes or realignment within sectors?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	72	Climate change is a very important issue for the public finances. If climate change is not addressed, there is a potential cost in terms of mitigation, particularly in terms of flooding but also a number of costs that would be related to it. In addition, if nothing is done, there is the cost that a more violent and costly adjustment will be needed down the way. Just from a public finance perspective, leaving aside all the benefits in terms of making life on this planet more sustainable, taking policy measures in this area is a very important thing to do. In terms of the impact on public finances, there are some positive impacts. For example, some of this could be achieved by higher environmental taxes such as the carbon tax or through charges and things like that. In addition, adapting and doing the transition to a low-carbon economy could create activity in the economy which would create employment and tax revenues in that way. It is not a wholly negative story for the public finances. However, there are some areas where investment, especially public investment, will be needed to achieve those objectives and where incentives will potentially need to be provided. There will be a cost to the State in that case and it needs to be factored into the State's plans. It is very helpful that there is now a clearer target in this area, and it is to be hoped the economic plans can be aligned to make sure this can be achieved in a way that is effective but is also consistent with the sustainability of the public finances.

Is there a resolution to the financial pressures around an ageing population other than a long-term project around pensions, or what can we expect to see in that report?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	74	The Deputy will see the report when it comes out, but the point we will try to make, as is always our position, is not to tell policymakers what they should do to address any issue but to highlight some of those issues. In particular, the two big increases we will highlight are in social protection and health spending, where the pressures that grow over the next 30 years will be quite substantial. If we add those two together, the numbers we are talking about are of the order of some 8% of GNI. If one accepts that these are Government spending commitments which will have to be met, then the decision has to be made either to raise funds from another source to make up for that spending or to cut spending in another area. The key point is that these are relatively slow-moving, easily predictable trends, and the sooner one takes action the better. One can take small bits of action over long periods to mitigate the effects of these issues on the fiscal position. That is the key point we are going to draw out in the report.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	75	The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was set up as a reaction to the previous economic collapse. In this session and any other sessions, I am mindful of comparing the coming economic pain and collapse with what happened previously. What level of engagement has taken place between the Government and IFAC since the pandemic hit in early March? Has there been an increase in meetings, engagements or anything like that? I would expect that there would be such an increase given that we have an emergency team for the health element of this crisis which meets very regularly. What level of advice has been sought from the council and has there been an increase in its engagement with Government since this pandemic hit?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	76	The stability programme, which is what our report in April was based on, was put together with great speed and at a very complicated time by the Department of Finance. I think the Department did a good job in this regard. In terms of our engagement, because the council is independent and also places a high weight on transparency, we do not have separate meetings in private with the Government or Government officials. We produce our reports. That is where our advice is available to the Minister but also to Deputies and anyone else in the country. We do not have that kind of relationship to Government. We communicate through the public advice that we provide.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	77	On that type of engagement, is Mr. Barnes satisfied that there has been enough engagement or is there anything more the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council could have offered in the past couple of months?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	78	I hope the report we provided has given a useful framework for people. I am not aware of anyone else who has done three fiscal scenarios for the next five years anywhere in the world. I think that helps to set the context. As they see this Government debt coming up, many people might legitimately be worried about what is going to happen and whether we are getting into trouble. By looking at the medium term, we can be relatively reassuring and say that we can be confident that there should be fiscal space for the stimulus measures and the emergency measures. That will come with adjustment but, hopefully, we have also been helpful in pointing out that this adjustment will be much less than people remember from a decade ago, even in a difficult scenario for Covid-19. I hope we have played our role and that the report has been helpful to the Government and people of Ireland.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	79	To follow on from the points Deputy Hourigan raised, is our over-reliance on corporation tax receipts akin to our over-reliance on stamp duty previously or would that be a false comparison to draw? What kinds of other taxation measures are needed to decrease our over-reliance on corporation tax?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	80	The comparison with stamp duty in the past is very close. It is a very large share of Government revenue. It is very volatile. Much of the money is coming from multinational companies and has essentially been raised in other countries so it is not like most taxes where we tax Peter to pay Paul. This is a net injection of money coming into the economy so the economic implications could be significant. However, to be reassuring, I do not believe they are on the scale of the previous housing boom but they are significant and it should be a concern. In terms of specific tax policies, that is not something the council has a view on but it is welcome that there will be a commission to examine taxation and welfare. It is good that these issues are examined in a serious, careful and evidence-driven way. It is important in the long run to the sustainability of public finances that Ireland has a broad-based tax base that is favourable to growth, respectful to the climate, fair and maintains public support. That is the right place to go for answers to that question.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	81	In phase 2, the council indicates that consumer spending will remain weak. We can all understand that. We will require a return of confidence to ameliorate that. Does Mr. Barnes have any thoughts on how we can increase consumer confidence in phase 2?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	82	It is not easy for economists to know how to do that. I believe the confidence that comes from the fiscal stimulus being sizeable and a strong package will give consumers more money in their pockets and, hopefully, a desire to spend it. That will be particularly true if it is targeted at those who need it most, specifically people who have lost their jobs and sectors that are really suffering. That will help a great deal. Reassuring people that public health is still well managed and they can go out with confidence, as Professor McMahon said, is very important from a behavioural perspective. Having a clear, medium-term fiscal plan, particularly for financial markets, is also important. It is important that these markets have confidence that Ireland is planning, after this extraordinary situation, to get its house back in order and reduce debt from very high levels, which need to be brought back to safer levels once the economy is strong enough.

In 2008, the banks were in the eye of the storm and their lending had to contract very quickly. That was hugely damaging to the economy, including to the SME sector, as we have discussed. The fact that the banks are in better shape this time, in addition to the measures that have been introduced by the European Central Bank, is one of the reasons the recovery should be much faster than it was in 2008.

Thank you, Mr. Barnes. I call Deputy Shortall.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	89	I welcome all the witnesses. A reference was made a few moments ago to the cost of Sláintecare and I was quite taken aback at the figure used. I ask that Mr. Barnes provide me with details of how that figure was reached. I am not asking him for it today but could he send it on in correspondence? It is very much out of line with costings that have been done in the past couple of years. On the issue of equity in our public health service, and no doubt recent events have shown up the huge gaps and weaknesses in that regard, there is the question of reducing the cost of living as result of the high cost of healthcare and thus freeing up disposable income. Would Mr. Barnes accept there is a strong argument for investing in good quality public services as a means of stimulating the economy? Aside from the need for a stimulus package to reboot business, there is a strong argument for investing in and making public services universal, including making housing affordable, as a means of reducing the cost of living. Before the pandemic arose, the business community and IBEC talked about the high cost of living and impact on wages. What is Mr. Barnes's view on the need to invest strongly in public services to make them universally available, as is the case in most other European countries, as a means of stimulating the economy and reducing the cost of living?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	90	Let me make two points. First, in our view the ambitious plans around Sláintecare as a part of the programme for Government can be afforded if the right fiscal decisions are taken. In many ways, the programme released yesterday is welcome, in particular, the plan to broadly balance the budget by 2025. This is necessary to reduce debt in the way it needs to be reduced given the high and risky level it will be at. These things are affordable, but there are big question marks around how it is going to be financed. This is a major shift in the way healthcare is provided. It is not entirely clear at this point, and the agreement pushes it down the track a bit, how that is going to be financed when big commitments have been made around other aspects of spending, for example, welfare and tax, and particularly not to raise income tax rates which account for approximately one third of taxation. It can be afforded but it is not very clear. There are big question marks in this plan around how that is going to be done. A central idea of stimulus measures is that one can spend a lot, but it needs to be temporary. That means once the crisis has passed, one can bring it back down and the public finances can be rebalanced and restabilised.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	91	I asked Mr. Barnes about the principle of investing in public services on a universal basis as a means of reducing the cost of living, not about a temporary stimulus package. However, I want to move on. Mr. Barnes can come back to me in writing with his response to that question. How will the stimulus package and investment in public services be funded, and what support is available from the EU? The Next Generation EU plan totals approximately €750 billion at this point. What is Mr. Barnes's understanding of what might be available to Ireland, first, in terms of grants, and, second, in terms of low-cost borrowing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	92	In terms of those measures some money would be available. I am not an expert on that, one of my colleagues may want to jump in. It is not an issue we have looked at very closely. To partly come back to the Deputy's earlier point, it is important to distinguish between two notions in investing in public services-----
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	93	If he does not mind, I would prefer that Mr. Barnes answer the second question I asked. What is his estimate of what funding would be available from that Next Generation EU plan?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	94	I do not have an estimate, although Dr. Casey might. I am afraid we do not have those numbers but we can provide them to the Deputy.

What is Mr. Barnes's estimate of what is available?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	96	I am afraid we do not have those figures. Ireland can borrow at very low rates at the moment, so the short-term significance of other forms of financing may not be so-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	98	To answer the Deputy's question regarding amounts that will be available from the Franco-German proposal and the €750 billion, that is very uncertain. We have seen estimates ranging from a couple of billion euro to several billion euro. Depending on how that funding is allocated, there is a huge variance in what might accrue to Ireland. There is also the question of what Ireland will be contributing, and therefore the question of how much we will be receiving in net terms. It is just too difficult to say-----
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	99	Does IFAC have a working estimate at the moment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	100	No, not at the moment. It is too soon.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	101	Reference was made to what is effectively an overlap with or mapping onto phase 3 of IFAC's plan. The programme for Government, regarding that period, refers to utilising taxation and expenditure measures to close the deficit, while IFAC refers to phase 3 being a period of fiscal consolidation to bring the debt-to-GNI* ratio down. It seems to me that IFAC is at pains to avoid describing this as a period of austerity, but I would like to explore that further because on the figures here, unfortunately, it does not seem to me that there are many other conclusions available. The point was made that the adjustment would be significantly less than that implemented after the 2008 crisis. That is based, however, on looking at the figures over seven years after 2008, versus three years from 2023 to 2025. If we look at the figures on a year-on-year basis, and the potential for a €14 billion adjustment between 2023 and 2025, that works out as a higher amount of fiscal consolidation - in layman's terms, austerity - than we had post the 2008 crisis.  The opening statement from IFAC goes on to state: "This does not mean a return to severe austerity." We can debate the adjective later. The statement continues: "We do not expect austerity in the sense of significant increases in unemployment due to severe fiscal adjustments taking place in a downturn." IFAC is stating that is not austerity, but then redefines austerity as something that nobody defines it as. Austerity, as defined by most people, refers to economic measures to close deficits based on increasing taxation or decreasing public expenditure. That is really what IFAC foresees happening in phase 3 from 2023 to 2025, and, on a year-by-year basis, IFAC sees that process coming in at around a similar amount to the kind of year-by-year austerity we saw from 2008 onwards. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	102	Let me clarify that what we mean by "fiscal adjustment" here is exactly that, to close the deficit that would have opened up because incomes are permanently lower, but consumption, even once things like stimulus are unwound, would be at a higher level and there would be a gap, in the central deficit scenario, of 3%. That gap would need to be closed to get the debt-to-GNI* ratio back on the safer trajectory, and that would require an increase in taxation or measures around spending. It would not necessarily require spending cuts in nominal terms, but it could, for example, require freezing some forms of spending that would contribute quite a lot to closing that gap. Regarding precise figures, and this may be an imprecision on our part and I apologise for that, we have three scenarios. The three years is more what we had in mind for the central scenario. If we were in the severe scenario, where more adjustment is needed, which is still, in aggregate, a third of what was required post crisis, the adjustment would not be spread over three years but spread over a longer time. Essentially, we believe that if interest rates stay low that will create a very favourable environment.If the economy is recovering and growing at a steady pace by that point there should be a steady process of adjustment. The larger the adjustment, the more drawn out that process will be. To be absolutely clear, we do not have a period of adjustment of anything like the speed and severity of what happened in 2008 in mind. I apologise if that was unclear in our submission. That is absolutely not what we------
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	103	The submission states that this "would require total adjustments ranging from €6 to €14 billion over the period 2023–2025". An adjustment of €14 billion over a three-year period equates to €4.666 billion per year, which is more than the average between 2008 and 2014.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	104	To be clear, that adjustment would not necessarily take place by 2025 in the severe scenario to which the €14 billion figure corresponds. It could be spread out over a longer period. I apologise, as that may have been unclear in the document sent to the committee, but that is absolutely not what we had in mind.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	105	There is a danger in taking the severe scenario as the most likely outcome. The central scenario entails an adjustment of €10 billion happening much further down the line, when the economy is growing and is near its capacity again. That would be one third of what we saw over the period of the financial crisis and would take place over less than half the time period we saw during the previous-----
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	106	That means the year-on-year figure would be about equivalent.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	107	In the central scenario the year-on-year figure would be about three quarters of the average adjustment, but it would be for less than half the time we saw in the past.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	108	The average adjustment over the 2008 period was very front-loaded. As anyone who remembers living through that period will know, the degree of tightening in some periods was really very tight. It really was an emergency situation. We do not think that is a particularly likely outcome. An average figure over a really long period may be misleading. It may not be the easiest way of thinking about it. It should be thought of as a moderate adjustment which would exert a downward force on growth but would not disrupt the economy in the way that fiscal consolidation did. In any case, these are scenarios. Exactly what the economy can stand and what will be necessary will depend on the circumstances. By the third phase we should not need to slam on the brakes as happened last time. That is absolutely not what we wanted to communicate.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	109	I would like to return to a point previously touched on by Deputy McGuinness concerning the SME sector. I would like to reflect on some of the points the witnesses made in their analysis of SMEs' financial health, rude or otherwise. I am quite close to the SME sector. I share Deputy McGuinness's concerns about the financial well-being of a lot of businesses at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, let alone during the emergence from it. What are the witnesses' overall thoughts on the demand side? I would think that we are in for a quite negative demand outlook for the next 12 to 18 months, simply because there will be a lot of fear. There will be changes in the nature of demand with people not working and so on. The other point made in the submission concerns the potential for fiscal enlargement as opposed to fiscal consolidation. I refer to the possibility of increases in employers' pay-related social insurance, PRSI, contributions and of targeting pension plans. Employers are very concerned that they are probably facing into such measures. Do the witnesses have any points to make on that? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	110	I share the Deputy's assessment of the SME sector. The points he made are absolutely right. It is very important to note that the SME sector will be a key part of the recovery and the creation of employment. That is one of the reasons why the emergency support measures the Government has taken in phase 1 are so important. They should be accessible to all firms. The creation of demand in these areas is also why the stimulus in the second phase is very important. As we discussed earlier, it may be appropriate to target some of the stimulus at sectors that will struggle because of the nature of what they do. Some of those sectors are very jobs-rich. The choices made further down the road will be a political decision. As I said earlier, increases in taxation should be considered in light of their impact on growth and jobs. SMEs are a key part of that.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	111	I will ask a question about what I describe as regionality. I represent Waterford where there has been a low instance of Covid-19 and the county would have come out of the crisis much sooner but we did not have an opportunity to exit lockdown ahead of anybody else. Do the reports that IFAC gives to the Government reflect sectoral analysis by geography as well as by sector as it relates to some of the measures that are being proposed? I also have a question about the provision of stimulus moneys which the witnesses have referenced. We know that funding is coming from the ECB and other programmes. How are those moneys to be dropped into the economy in the future? Are they going to go through the pillar banks, from which we have seen a requirement for 20% capital funding at a time 48% of loans are not approved? As I asked Dr. Orlaigh Quinn, Secretary General of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation last week, is there an opportunity to put this into revenue? Are we looking at that proposal in the future?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	112	The Deputy's concern about the regional dimension is valid. That is something we mentioned in the report and think about. Because of the nature of the sectors involved, there may be a big impact on regions and that might make things particularly difficult. That should condition the way in which policy is designed. It is different to have difficulties in a region while everywhere else is booming from a region where everyone has been affected. That is important. The actions of the ECB are on two fronts. One is through supporting the banking system and the ECB has taken important measures to keep open the supply of credit, particularly to corporations. The other part is the ECB's support for the public debt market in the euro area and that is one of the factors keeping interest rates very low. In turn, that is one of the factors protecting the Government's ability to borrow and create the fiscal space to undertake stimulus packages and the policy measures that are needed. The ECB's role in this has been very important on the banking side and how it feeds into Government spending because the Government is borrowing money to spend and the borrowing conditions are determined by the ECB.

Will the council recommend any such measure to the Government?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	114	We have not looked at that explicitly. At the moment, the Government debt position is extremely favourable so that underpins these kinds of policies. It is always interesting to think about ways of improving the liquidity and diversity of the Government's funding sources and that might be an idea worth considering but it is not something which we have looked at.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	115	I thank the gentlemen and ladies who are with us today. We all know that we are moving towards a recession and the document from IFAC states that this recession could last for two to three years whereas the previous recession lasted 11 years. I sincerely hope the council is right about that. Will our witnesses please explain why I am reading the situation differently? In the most recent recession, while businesses were struggling, most were still rolling on. I have talked to other public representatives and had meetings with business owners whose businesses have closed due to Covid-19. They told me that their businesses will not reopen because they need grant aid or lower interest rate loans immediately and are not getting it. That is the case in the West Cork constituency that I represent and throughout the country. I am talking about five or six businesses in towns, some of which employ up to 20 people. Do the witnesses think I am looking at this differently from them? It seems as if this will be a worse recession than the most recent one and will take far more than two to three years to recover from.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	116	The Deputy is right that the current position is putting considerable pressure on firms. As we have said, one of the things that could put us into the severe scenario is that the pressure on firms is bigger than the Government has anticipated and is covered by our central scenario, or if the policy response is less effective than anticipated. I am not in a position to assess that and it will depend on what happens in the coming months. It is interesting to hear what the Deputy is saying in that context. One thing to be made clear is that once the confinement measures are lifted, although things will not return to normal in any sense, the economy will pick up. People will be able to go back to work once they have their kids in school. A lot of activity will naturally pick up and we might see quite a strong growth rate next year but it will not be anywhere near enough to fill the gap in demand and unemployment will remain high.It is not that we are not going to see any growth, it is just that things will remain far below the level they used to be at for quite a while. On the comparison with the previous crisis, Ireland went into that with an overheated housing market, people were very stretched on the credit side, Government revenues turned out to be very fragile and the banking system became very distressed. We know that whenever that happens, one ends up with a very deep, lasting, and nasty recession. In this case, the public finances and the banks are going into it in better shape and the European reaction has been much more timely and effective. These give reasons for hope, even though I appreciate that for some of the Deputy's constituents, it is proving very hard to see that today.

In the last week, and I presume it is the same for every other politician, I met people from the hotel, bed and breakfast accommodation and Airbnb sectors and the biggest issue emerging from these meetings is the lowering of the VAT rate to 0%. What is the lowest rate that Mr. Barnes can advise that would lead to a recovery in the tourism sector?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	118	We do not look at specific measures of that sort but it may well be appropriate as part of the targeting to look at sectors like the hotel sector. Temporary taxation measures can be one instrument that is effective but there may be others.

How would Mr. Barnes propose this could happen?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	120	Those kinds of supports should be kept in place as long as they are needed. It may be that there is a need to adjust them as conditions evolve and may need to be more sectorally focused, as some sectors continue to face difficulties and others do not. We, on the council, are not experts in designing such schemes. All we know is that they need to be kept in place and that they can be financed.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	121	For businesses that are contemplating not reopening, what positive advice can Mr. Barnes give these businesses to encourage them to contemplate opening their businesses once more?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	122	The only encouragement I can give them is that the health situation has improved greatly. We are progressing through the different stages of the easing of the restrictions. The Government is in a position through the programme that has been set out to continue these emergency support measures, which should help firms to survive and help individuals. There also should be a sizeable stimulus package that will put money back into people’s pockets and provided people are more comfortable and confident about the health situation, which will naturally take time but will happen, hopefully, there are better days ahead.
#MaireadFarrell	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-party	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-dob	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	123	There will be on average €10 billion required from 2023 to 2025. Professor McMahon has said that this would be required through either increasing taxation or cutting areas of public spending. In the programme for Government, we see that there is a commitment to index tax credits and bands from 2022 in line with wage inflation of 2% to 3%. The cumulative cost of these tax cuts from 2022 to 2025 is between €2.7 billion and €4 billion. In addition to this, the programme for Government promises a tax cut for people earning over €100,000 at the cost of €123 million a year. Given the fact that the programme for Government has ruled progressive taxation, and Mr. Barnes has said that the adjustment of approximately €10 billion will need to be made by either tax increases or spending cuts, what areas would need to be looked at to make that adjustment, given the €3 billion cost that indexing would have? My deep concern here is that there will be spending cuts in health, housing and childcare but what is Mr. Barnes's take on what areas would need to be looked at?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	124	I agree with the Deputy that one aspect of the programme for Government is the commitment to index the tax system. There are also commitments on income taxation. Income taxation is approximately one third of Exchequer tax returns. This means that raising taxes on a large part of revenue is being ruled out. There is also commitment on corporation tax rates. On the spending side, there is a commitment on maintaining social welfare rates.A number of commitments have been made that reduce the margin for manoeuvre for the Government quite significantly as to how they address, on the one hand, the need to consolidate the public finances that is likely to exist in the third phase and, on the other hand, how to finance measures like Sláintecare. There are big questions on how this is going to be financed. The council does not have a view as to how that should happen but as my colleague, Professor McMahon, said, the options are very simple. The options are to reduce spending in other areas, to increase the efficiency of spending or to increase taxation in other areas. However, as important options are being kept off the table, it is going to be very difficult to balance those things and to meet these new spending commitments around housing and health and at the same time maintain fiscal sustainability. The council has a concern that by making it more difficult the risks to fiscal sustainability have been increased because the temptation may well be to borrow more rather than to raise revenues or cut spending. When starting from a position of very high debt that is a risky strategy, so there are some concerns about that.
#MaireadFarrell	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-party	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-dob	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	125	Given those two options, and from what Professor McMahon said, it is concerning. It is clear to me that if there is a lack of willingness to include progressive taxation, it will mean a freeze or cut in spending on health, housing and childcare.  On another aspect of this, it has been forecasted that there will be a significant fall in income tax receipts, VAT, etc., in the short to medium term. Would Mr. Barnes agree that for both unemployment levels and Government revenue, we will largely be relying on the success of our SME sector and, therefore, on the success of Government supports for those SMEs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	126	Let me come back to the final point. Although some options have been kept off the table, other options are still there. For example, one option would be to raise VAT. Another option that is mentioned in the document is raising PRSI rates and there are other taxes mentioned, or that are possible, including the increase in carbon taxation. The increase in carbon tax that is envisaged would raise about €800 million out to 2025, which is an important and useful contribution but is not on anything like the scale that is required. Anyway there are other tax options there. On the Deputy's second point, as we have discussed with other members of the committee this morning, the recovery of the SME sector is a key part of the recovery. If it does not happen we will be in a much more difficult situation and we will be much closer to the kind of severe scenario that we outlined in our report. The recovery of the SME sector and support of it with both emergency measures in the near term and ultimately with stimulus is very important.

We are looking at increased unemployment. Longer-term unemployment could be higher than it was before Covid-19. There is the possibility of an accelerated shift towards automation in certain sectors and that is very worrying for people who rely on that employment. What is the council's take on what jobs and sectors are most susceptible to that shift towards automation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	128	Ms Holland may want to answer this question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	129	This shift to automation is an issue that is of wide concern globally as well as in Ireland. At a macro level there is less concern. At a micro level of individual sectors and individual employees there may be some job losses but at the same time, it will be creating new avenues for employment. This is a process that is likely to take several years to stabilise but could fill those jobs that are lost. In the short term many firms have learned how to work remotely and have learned how to not maintain a physical workplace.There may be some fallout from that, but we do not expect it to have a short-term dramatic impact on employment rates across the country.

Receipts were buoyant in the first quarter and once again outperformed forecasts, as has been the trend in recent years. There is concern about the potential threats to corporation tax in future, but the buoyancy in the first quarter was largely driven by the activities of a small number of multinational enterprises. IFAC has noted that about 50% of 2018's corporate tax receipts was accounted for by just ten companies. How significant a risk to revenue is posed by this strategy of putting all eggs in one basket?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	131	The council has noted on a number of occasions that it is a major risk to public finances as it is being used to meet permanent spending commitments. They are concentrated on a small number of companies, many of which are very international and could move abroad if they decided. There are also risks associated with the international tax environment. It is a serious risk in the medium term. In the short run it is a risk but it can go either way. Corporation tax receipts might be very poor this year because of some of the domestic impacts in that very few companies will be making much profit. On the other hand, the multinational sector receipts may be quite good, and may even surprise on the upside. We will have to wait and see, as always.
#MaireadFarrell	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-party	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-dob	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	132	The IFAC fiscal assessment forecasted real GDP growth of 8% in 2021. I am concerned this is optimistic, especially considering the possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 and renewed restrictions, as we see in China. Does the favourable forecast assume a UK-EU trade deal will be reached by the first deadline of 31 December?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	133	The growth rates for next year may be quite high because the economy will be bouncing back, assuming everything works out like the central scenario. Assuming there are no more confinement measures once they are lifted, we will compare 2020, which is a year that was partially locked down and very disrupted, with 2021, which will be a year when business should be functioning again. One can easily get growth rates that appear strong relative to what we are used to seeing, but that is only closing a very small part of the gap relative to the initial downturn. The Deputy noted there are downside risks, particularly in the event of a second wave into next year. That could have very severe consequences. There are many risks around this but it is not surprising to see a high growth rate. That should not be interpreted as a boom of any sort. It is just a correction in the sense that business that goes from being locked down to open is going to be able to contribute to GDP. In terms of the other risks, and the Deputy has described corporation tax, Brexit is a risk. These central scenarios and what is in the stability programme all assume we move to a relatively good free trade agreement with the UK at the end of the year. The Deputy can assess the likelihood of that for herself. There is clearly a risk that we are in a severe scenario of the sort that we considered last year of a no-deal Brexit at the end of the year. That prospect should not be discounted. IFAC did a lot of analysis of that last autumn, if the Deputy is interested. That could provide a very severe shock to the economy and comes against a background where the economy is already weakened. There is a discussion about whether that shock might be greater or less in the current environment but it will definitely add to the situation and make the recovery much more difficult. It remains a real risk.

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	135	I thank the witnesses for their attendance and for the work they are doing in economic planning.On the issue of helping the economy, one of the problems I am coming across is the delay by banks in responding to the new challenges, especially in the housing market. I have seen cases where banks are not allowing people in receipt of full incomes to draw down loans because the employer of one of the parties is receiving Covid support. In one case, for instance, a builder was to be paid €60,000 but the money could not be drawn down. The person had used their savings to pay for the site on which the house was being built. How can the Government work with the banks given that they are afraid to move where there is even a 1% level of risk? How can that be changed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	136	The Deputy asked a very good question, which he should probably address to the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank. These are important issues, the kinds of things it is important that policy address. However, as a fiscal advisory council, we will leave it to the real experts to deal with them.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	137	Does Mr. Barnes agree that it will add to the economic downturn if the way the banks are managing the situation is allowed to continue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	138	As the Deputy says, there is definitely a concern. It is important to maintain a dynamic in the housing market and to keep it ticking over. It is definitely an issue people should be thinking about.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	139	It is about cash flow. It also applies to small businesses with a good track record that are now looking for an extension of their borrowings to assist them with cash flow. The same response is being given to SMEs by the banking sector. In real terms, the banking sector could be adding to the economic downturn. I am not saying it is adding to it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	140	Deputy Colm Burke is absolutely right. It is important that businesses that are solvent but facing liquidity problems as a result of the Covid crisis are helped by the banks or the Government or both working together. It is very important that we do not have unnecessary long-term damage done to the economy where viable businesses run by able people that provide good services are sacrificed because of a lack of liquidity.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	141	This type of policy by the banks could contribute to such a downturn.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	142	I think so. As I stated, none of us on the council is an expert on the banking system. Deputy Burke probably knows far more about it than we do, but it obviously would be a concern if solvent businesses are not receiving the credit that they should receive.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	143	On the issue of exports, my understanding is that in March pharmaceutical exports were up 60% year on year. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council predicts an 8% fall in exports. Has it identified exactly where that fall in exports will occur? Is it in a specific area, for instance, electronics or services? Where do we expect the downturn to manifest?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	144	The predicted fall in exports that we are interested in will come from two things. One is that the disruption to supply chains and trade caused by Covid has made it harder for people to export goods and the other is weak demand. Demand is weak everywhere. It is partly disrupted by the virus but is also due to the same factors of low investment and low consumption affecting demand overseas as well as here. That is where we see the fall in export demand coming from. A highly relevant point for Ireland is that the multinational sector is responsible for a lot of the pharmaceutical exports and those exports would have relatively little impact on Ireland in terms of employment, taxation and other things. The position is very different for exports from more traditional sectors, such as agrifood, which employ many more people and are much more anchored in the economy. The exports we are most concerned about are from domestic sectors as opposed to multinationals, which are often very volatile as well.Perhaps the chief economist or other colleagues wish to comment. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	145	Two of the sectors that would have been hit very much on the export side, in terms of people's projections, would be things like tourism, which is considered an export.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	146	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	147	There is also manufacturing of traditional manufacturing goods: hardware, machinery equipment and that kind of thing. They would have been the key areas. As Mr. Barnes has said, it is down to a mixture of a weaker demand externally from export markets but also the confinement measures themselves, which actually restrict movement.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	148	I wish to refer to the forecast and how we manage. If there is a situation where there is no agreement on Brexit, what do we need to do now to plan for that scenario? Obviously it is the last thing we want to happen but, if it does, then it is another new challenge.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	149	We understand that a great deal of contingency planning has been done. On the economic side, it may be that it requires additional stimulus measures. That is one of the things that could be considered when future packages are set. As with Covid but perhaps even to a greater extent, a hard Brexit might be a long shock and so very much a change in Ireland's trading relationships. That might have more long-term consequences. That might be important in terms of measures, for example, around training or supporting firms and activities to transition to a post-Brexit world so it would have a major impact. The stimulus could and should be provided in that situation but some of these long-term issues would have to be addressed.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	150	Savings in this country have been mentioned in terms of comparisons with 2008. The high level of borrowings in 2008 are not the same as now in 2020. Savings are now totally different as there is a significant amount of savings by individuals and, indeed, companies are in a good financial position. How can one now use those savings more effectively? Where there is a reduction in business and purchasing, what can be done to encourage the effective use of savings?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	151	Perhaps Professor McMahon can answer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	152	With some of the increase in aggregate saving that we see, we also have to think carefully that there is a distribution in all of this. Some households, for instance, continue to get their full income, work from home and have been able to do that. As a result they have been unable to spend because shops have not been open or the usual things they would spend on have not been possible and, therefore, their saving rates are very high. We also have to be wary that at the other end of the distribution there are some people who have lost a lot of income, cut consumption and nevertheless their savings have either gone to zero or they have run down their savings. To go back to the earlier answer that I gave, it is very difficult at this stage to know how people will react. If people have savings when lockdown measures ease, will they immediately rush out to spend them? We do not know exactly how they will react. Similarly, as Mr. Barnes said earlier, ensuring that the policies are in place to provide supports for those people who maybe do not have savings is going to be particularly important to maintain demand in the economy once we get back towards a more normal situation. Again, without going into a specific policy, when thinking about stimulus, these sorts of issues and targeting measures, for instance, that may encourage spending again in certain sectors, one that was mentioned by one of the Deputies earlier was reducing VAT rates. A temporary measure like that might be targeted at certain sectors to try to reinvigorate demand. Again, that goes back to the point that we have made all along that there is huge uncertainty. At the same time at this point in this recession or economic slowdown we probably have more resources in aggregate, even if they are distributed in a very uneven way, that at least provide some basis for demand to come back when the health officials tell us it is safe to do so. 
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	153	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations, and, indeed, their paper. It is widely acknowledged that 26% of our workforce is currently unemployed or on pandemic unemployment supports of some type or other. From its paper, I gather that the IFAC has three scenarios developed: mild, which would be where conditions improve rapidly and there would be minimum impact; a central scenario, where the confinement measures ease but there is a lasting impact; and severe, where there would be repeated lockdowns and wider financial distress as a consequence. Is it Mr. Barnes's view, based on this discussion and discussions outside this Chamber, that contingent on how the economy will develop and reboot over the next number of months and years, aside from what he calls financial stimulus which I will discuss later, is the health management and the confidence that we as members of the public will express in our local and, indeed, national economy? If we do not manage the health aspect of this crisis well enough, we will be looking at the third scenario of repeated lockdowns, a significant financial impact, etc. Equally, if we as members of the public do not express enough confidence to go to the local hotel, restaurants, pubs or whatever the case might be, then the economy will lose. Does Mr. Barnes agree with the importance of health management and behavioural economics - confidence of the public - and how best does one get that message out? That message is not getting out there and we as members of the public have a proactive role to play in the rebooting of the economy aside from the financial stimulus.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	154	The Deputy is absolutely right. The health outcomes are critical. It is encouraging to see the news over the recent phase on how circumstances are improving. There are also big questions about what might happen, for example, in the autumn, and about a second wave. That is critical. That also leads to the second point about confidence. If the public is reassured about the health situation and the authorities have the health situation well managed even though they are fighting this very nasty virus, that would be helpful for people going out. It also speaks to having the right sort of measures in place so that when people go out, they are confident that places are safe and that they can go about their business. All of that is important. Beyond that, and even conditional on the health outcomes, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the economic outcomes will be. We discussed, for example, the SMEs. It is quite difficult, with the kind of data that economists look at all the time, to know exactly what the state of the SMEs is and how that sector will recover. It is difficult as well to know in this unprecedented crisis how people will respond to all of this, and the confidence aspect is important. The more the public authorities can do to manage the health situation properly but also restore this confidence and get things moving again, the better. Part of that is probably about having a plan for the medium term as well, not only for how we get out of the crisis but a vision for where the economy will go, for example, with issues such as climate change and pensions that otherwise might hang over people as a cloud with them not knowing where things are going to head. Having a good, credible plan about that will also be helpful to people in their economic decision-making.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	155	I agree with Mr. Barnes. Clarity, in itself, breeds confidence. I draw his attention to what the IFAC calls in its paper the "appropriate fiscal stance". It has three phases. A significant element of that is the need for a fiscal stimulus. We have spoken at length about the SMEs, which are hugely important. I come from County Kerry, which is hugely dependent on tourism. Independent studies show that Kerry is the county that has been most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic because of its reliance on tourism. I ask Mr. Barnes's view on the fact that a county, such as Kerry, particularly from the tourism point of view, needs a particular financial stimulus package on the basis that it is the county that has been most impacted. Have there been any studies on the impact on tourism and what that means for the tourism economy, both to a county such as Kerry, and nationally as well?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	156	We know that tourism is very important across Ireland. I do not have any specific studies in mind that I can share with the Deputy but she is absolutely right that the regional aspect will be an issue. The situation will be very different in an area like Kerry where many people may be negatively affected by a decline in tourism. It would be very hard for such people to get jobs in other sectors because tourism is so important to the area's economy. In places such as Dublin, if a company suffers, a person may be able to find a job more easily in another sector. Addressing the regional dimension is very important, particularly to avoid lasting unemployment. Making sure that money reaches the parts it needs to reach, which will include the regions that are more heavily impacted, is a helpful way to think about things.

It has pointed out that, if the situation is managed properly, we may return to pre-Covid levels of activity within two to three and a half years. Will Mr. Barnes comment on that very briefly?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	160	As we have discussed this morning, we are confident that we should be able to avoid the kind of severe and painful austerity that people will remember from the period from 2008 to 2010 and the associated negative impact on employment. This does not mean that difficult decisions will not have to be made in that period from 2023 to 2025. Some combination of higher taxes and reductions to some elements of spending will need to be envisaged in one way or another. It will not be an easy period, but it will be very different from what people will remember from the period from 2008 to 2010. I hope that message reassures people. Debt rising to very high levels does not mean that it will have the same consequences as it did between 2008 and 2010.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	161	I also thank the witnesses for coming and for giving up their time. It is much appreciated. In a recent article in the Irish Examiner, Mr. Barnes acknowledged that spending to support the recovery over the coming years is the right thing to do. He also noted the fiscal challenges that lie ahead of the next government. SMEs, which are indigenous businesses, will obviously be key to the economic recovery. Will Mr. Barnes tell me more about the specific stimulus packages which will need to be introduced? I would also like to tease out further Deputy Foley's point about the need for balanced regional development. I come from Waterford in the south east. It is a region that has underperformed since the last recession. Does Mr. Barnes believe that support should be tailored to specific regions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	162	I will let Ms Holland answer the point regarding the measures that might be helpful for stimulus. With regard to regional measures, this issue has come up a number of times. We do have to think very carefully with regard to the regions because some will be hit much harder than others. That makes the overall adjustment much more difficult. That is definitely a factor that needs to be taken into account both for purely economic reasons and for important social reasons. Perhaps Ms Holland will share a few thoughts on the design of fiscal stimulus.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	163	I do not want to be overly prescriptive on specific measures that might be introduced. We talked earlier about investment measures which could provide targeted temporary support to the economy to boost economic activity in the short term and which may also work towards some of our longer-term goals. For example, it was mentioned that advantage might be taken of the spare capacity in the construction sector to achieve higher energy efficiency standards in buildings, to expand electrification or to develop renewable energy. Such a measure could be used to provide some short-term stimulus to the economy. The key thing is trying to preserve or re-establish relationships between firms and employees. While employees have had to stay out of the workplace, many have become unemployed and have lost that connection. Some have retained their positions through the wage subsidy schemes but have been out of the office. Maintaining and strengthening those links and bringing firms and employees back together is crucial. That is what we wish to see.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	164	According to the Central Bank, people have saved significant amounts in recent months.Now as the economy reopens and people return to traditional shopping, we hope, do the witnesses believe this relative opening of the spending floodgates could drive inflation as supply struggles to cope? Could the scarcity of stock drive up prices? I refer, for example, to the cycle industry. Cycling has never been more popular and great numbers of people are purchasing bikes. We have seen in recent media reports that it takes about three months to have a bike manufactured and brought to Ireland. Might we see an increase in inflation as a result of this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	165	Certainly there is a possibility that we will see the price of certain goods go up, as the Deputy says. Central bankers and the European Central Bank in particular would not view the price of specific goods going up, even by a lot, as a particularly worrying measure of inflation. It is a relative price change reflecting the demand. Measuring inflation is already very difficult during this current period because a number of goods that form part of the normal basket that goes into inflation are no longer being traded. That makes the pure measurement of it very difficult. It is even difficult to go month to month to realise how prices are really evolving at the true, underlying level. The Deputy's question may have been getting at whether we should worry about inflation. I certainly think in this first phase, the actions of the ECB and most central banks around the world have reflected the fact that at this moment, even if it were to tick up a little bit, inflation is not the main enemy. The objective is to keep the economy ticking over to the best possible extent, as some of the other Deputies have mentioned, to ensure that SMEs are there to re-employ workers when lockdown measures are eased, to ensure that shops can reopen and people have somewhere to spend any money that they have. At this moment, inflation is not where central banks should be particularly worried. In the past few years, central banks have, if anything, been under-achieving on their inflation targets. A small move up towards them is not necessarily a bad thing. As to whether we have to shift our focus back towards inflation in phase 2 and certainly into phase 3, that will probably be appropriate but it is quite a bit down the road, at least for now.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	166	I have a couple of questions, if I may. Deputy Mairéad Farrell asked about the changing international tax environment, in particular with regard to the Franco-German bonds. What impact is that initiative likely to have? Are we likely to lose more in corporation tax than we would potentially gain from these bonds by that changing international tax environment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	167	It is possible to think about the two issues separately. Ireland raises an exceptionally high share of its revenue through corporation tax and is a significant location for foreign direct investment, FDI. How sustainable that is from an economic or political point of view is a big question. It is at the heart of our concerns about over-reliance on those tax heads. The Franco-German proposal on issuing bonds together in Europe is extremely significant and it is very important for Ireland. In the short run, the impact may not be enormous. Interest rates are so low and the ECB is being very active in the bond market. It adds an additional channel of financing but, as Dr. Casey said, it is not clear how much Ireland will get out of it in the short run. It is important but it is not hugely significant. What I think is important is the commitment that lies behind it. In 2008, we saw what happens when there are doubts about euro area countries standing behind each other in a position of crisis. When the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was set up, the bond spread was 14 percentage points on Irish Government debt. That is one of the reasons we had austerity. This was massively expensive and small countries like Ireland, particularly those without their own monetary policy, are always going to be vulnerable to these changes in behaviour, to use a term we have used this morning. That commitment at European level is extremely important. Some countries in the euro area are still struggling with high levels of public debt where the debt dynamics are much less favourable than they are in Ireland.These are real issues. Given the state the world is in, that commitment is important, but what it is really significant for is providing a backstop for the Irish public finances and giving confidence to markets. In that context, Ireland has much to gain from this.

Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	169	To clarify, that was the amount we would be adding to our level of debt. It is not necessarily borrowing. The borrowings this year look to be of the order of €23 billion, according to the Government's official SPU projections, but they could rise to €30 billion if circumstances become more severe than that. Next year, they are expected to be of the order of €14 billion, in the central scenario.

Among eurozone states, would we still be among the so-called PIGS, that is, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	171	Where we started, we were sixth highest among advanced, OECD countries, in terms of net debt and when cash assets and so on are stripped out. We would have been behind the likes of France, Portugal, Italy, Greece and Japan. It is almost impossible to say where each of those countries will end up in terms of debt because we just do not know what kind of stimulus they will introduce or how badly their individual economies will be affected. I imagine that if each country is affected broadly equally, we will still be towards the very high end of the pack, but it is just too uncertain to say at this stage.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	172	It is very hard to know, for the reasons Dr. Casey outlined. Two factors are important. Unlike in 2008, when Ireland was a particularly weak country that attracted particularly negative focus from the markets, Ireland is now kind of in the same boat as all the other countries. The Covid crisis has impacted Ireland like many other countries and so it is not suffering from a particular weakness, as it was in 2008. The other matter that is important for the medium term is that one benefit for Ireland is that it is likely that its medium-term growth rate will be quite a lot higher than that of many other countries. That partly reflects its demographics and partly reflects its productivity performance. Ireland's ability to get its debt down, if interest rates stay as low as they are, is likely to be greater than that of most other countries in the euro. That is a very positive aspect for Ireland in the medium run, assuming somewhat higher levels of growth than those of most other countries can be achieved. Growing the economy is very important, whether through stimulus or long-term investments in skills and all the measures needed to make the economy work. Ireland benefits from relatively favourable debt dynamics, even if it may be starting from a relatively high debt level.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	174	Demographics are a very important part of the picture in Ireland-----
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	175	How important is immigration as part of that demographic picture, as opposed to having a high birth rate relative to mainland Europe?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	176	It has two effects. Dr. Casey might outline the numbers. Migration may be disrupted for a while because of the Covid crisis but in the longer run we assume it will carry on. A key aspect of migration in Ireland is that it amplifies growth. In periods where growth is high, migration tends to be much stronger and there is much bigger impulse, whereas in periods where growth is weak, migration tends to produce an adjustment mechanism as an outflow or some adjustment on migration. Much will depend on the underlying growth potential of the economy, but Dr. Casey might give a sense of the numbers in terms of how much is coming from a natural increase and from migration. We should bear in mind that migrants are typically of working age and migration is one factor that keeps people in the workforce, which is an important effect.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	177	I would not overstate the importance of migration. There will potentially be no inward migration in net terms this year and perhaps 10,000 people next year, rising towards 30,000 per year.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	178	Is that 13,000 or 30,000?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	179	It is 30,000 per year. Even at that, the more important demographic challenges we face in the long run are those just purely from ageing of the population which would be much larger than those several thousand. We are talking about net flows. The important thing to note about flows of migrants is that it varies a lot with the cycle. In good times, we see a lot of inward migration, as Mr. Sebastian Barnes said. In bad times, we see a lot of outward migration in net terms. Over the course of the business cycle, it might end up being close to zero on average. What really determines the long-run costs associated with ageing is actually the rate of natural births and natural ageing in the population.

That concludes this morning's session. I will now suspend the committee until 2 p.m. when we will be meeting with representatives from the ESRI and the University of Limerick. Deputy Butler will be chairing that session. Again, I thank everyone, including those on video link.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	181	I welcome from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, Professor Alan Barrett, director, Dr. Barra Roantree, research officer, and, via video link from the ESRI, Dr. Karina Doorley, senior research officer, as well as via video link from the department of economics at the University of Limerick, Professor Stephen Kinsella. Witnesses have been advised on the issue of privilege. I want to advise that witnesses giving evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them. No clear guidance can be given on whether the extent to which the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime. Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. I invite Professor Alan Barrett to make his opening statement. If he could conclude it within five minutes it would be appreciated.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	182	I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation to speak here today.The institute has undertaken much work on the Covid crisis since March, including our inputs into the work of NPHET, analyses of topics such as childcare and working from home, and the work on which we will focus today, namely, the fiscal impact, with particular reference to social protection expenditure. I refer first to macroeconomic impacts. In the recent Quarterly Economic Commentary, authored by our colleagues Mr. Kieran McQuinn, Mr. Conor O'Toole, Mr. Matthew Allen-Coghlan and Mr. Cathal Coffey, three scenarios for the economy in 2020 were presented. In the baseline scenario, the lockdown restrictions are gradually lifted until August, in line with the original Government guidelines. After this point, the economy enters a recovery phase that lasts until the end of the year. Under this scenario, real GDP is forecast to decline by more than 12% this year. Private consumption expenditure is expected to fall by 13% this year. The fall in investment is even more significant, declining by approximately 28%. International trade will also decline significantly, with imports falling by 12% and exports falling by 8%. In the severe scenario, the economic shock is even more stark, with a second wave of the virus resulting in the country going back into lockdown in quarter 4. In this case, real GDP is forecast to decline by more than 17% in 2020. The final scenario is the benign scenario. This is the most optimistic scenario, based on a situation in which the pandemic is suppressed so effectively over the latter half of the year that the economy returns to normal "pre-Covid" conditions in quarter 4. Under this scenario, the economy is forecast to decline by about 9% this year.  The impact of the crisis on the labour market can already be seen clearly. Including those on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the unemployment rate reached over 28% in April. Work by ESRI colleagues Beirne et al. and Dr. Barra Roantree has shown that the pandemic has had an asymmetric impact across the labour market, with some sectors and demographic groups impacted more significantly than others. In our baseline scenario, the unemployment rate is expected to average 17% for the year as a whole. No matter which scenario we find ourselves in, there will be significant repercussions for the public finances in 2020. In our winter 2019 commentary, we had forecast a modest deficit of 0.3% of GDP this year. This has been revised down to a 9% deficit under our baseline scenario. In nominal terms, this is a deficit of approximately €28 billion. Let me mention the PUP. Drawing again on the analysis of colleagues Beirne et al., we estimate the Exchequer impact of job losses in three scenarios. The medium job-loss scenario, involving 600,000 job losses, with the PUP in place is estimated to cost the Exchequer €4.9 billion per quarter, around €800 million more than in a situation in which the existing system of welfare supports remain unchanged.  We find that the introduction of the PUP did much to cushion incomes from Covid-19-related job losses. Figure 1 of my written submission, which I hope Deputies have in front of them, plots the number of families we estimate are affected by a job loss in our medium unemployment scenario, grouped by the size of the change in their disposable income. The number of families who lose more than 20% of their disposable income is reduced by around a third with the introduction of the PUP, and the number who lose more than 60% is reduced by almost one half.  That the PUP leaves some families with more disposable income out of work than they had in work raises the question of how the payment affects financial incentives to work. Although these may be of little importance while public health measures are in place, our simulations suggest careful consideration should be given to how these supports will be scaled back.  In addition to the PUP, the Government also introduced the temporary wage subsidy. Beirne et al. examined the impact of the initial version of this scheme on the Exchequer and households. This version of the scheme was less generous to lower paid employees than the revised scheme and excluded some higher earning workers from eligibility.  The Exchequer cost of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, was found to be potentially lower than the cost of the PUP as many workers are entitled to less than €350 per week under the scheme, and many receive a top-up payment from their employer. This conclusion will remain true for the revised scheme. We estimate that if half of those who lose their job in our "medium" unemployment scenario were to instead remain in work and receive the temporary wage subsidy alongside the maximum employer top-up allowed, the net impact on the Exchequer would be €360 million less per quarter than the PUP. This equates to approximately €120 million per quarter less for every 100,000 who transfer from the PUP to the TWSS, with a full-top up paid by the employer.  There is more on the TWSS in my written submission but I plan to proceed to my concluding remarks. We can pick up on some of the issues concerning dead weight and others in the questions.The ESRI, in its macroeconomic forecasting work, has not yet attempted to provide forecasts for 2021. We judged that there was simply too much uncertainty for such an exercise to be undertaken. However, like other forecasting agencies, we expect a fiscal deficit to remain in 2021 even in the context of a likely recovery. From a policy perspective, ongoing borrowing to fund such a deficit will be the correct option. The key consideration here is that borrowing is appropriate in the context of a temporary deficit which is likely to be closed as the economy grows. It will also be advisable to borrow for investment under a stimulus package. With interest rates close to zero, such a course would help to reboot the economy while also tackling some of the infrastructural needs which are well understood. Much has been written about a possible expanded role for the State in a post-Covid society, covering issues such as health, childcare and basic incomes. While borrowing is the appropriate response where a deficit is cyclical, an enhanced role for the State will have to mean higher taxes. Though the precise source and structure of those taxes is an open question, an increase in the total tax take is likely to be needed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	184	Can I be heard?
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	185	Yes. We will take your opening statement.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	186	"You are on mute" seems to be the phrase of the pandemic. I thank the Chair and the committee for the chance to address these important topics. I would like to make four points in my introductory remarks. A large fiscal deficit of around €30 billion is unavoidable in 2020. Government spending is unusually impactful at low and very low interest rates. With the economy deeply depressed, even in a small open economy like Ireland's, stimulus measures will be very effective. Stimulus measures should be significant, up to approximately 10% of modified gross national income, or €20 billion, including measures announced to date, which are approximately €7.8 billion. Much of this spending should come from funds linked to European programmes. Social protection expenditure from Vote 37 will likely substantially exceed its 2019 Estimate of €21.2 billion. In May 2020, the expected cumulative spend up to the end of that month was to have been €8.7 billion. It ended up being €11.7 billion, approximately €3 billion more. There is no doubt that June, July, and August will also see substantial increases in spending above profile as the pandemic income supports to employers and to employees are continued. The Department has already spent more than half of its allocated money, and so a Supplementary Estimate of €2 billion to €3 billion for Vote 37 will be required to take it to the end of the year, assuming 200,000 more people remain unemployed in September and that income supports are tapered rather than summarily withdrawn by sector. My third point concerns the sectoral nature of the collapse. Beyond the disaster relief phase, when we exit phase 5 of the pandemic, a range of income supports will have to be kept in place for badly affected sectors such as the arts, tourism, and travel. This will greatly impact Vote 37 and Vote 32, Business, Enterprise, and Innovation, which will most likely see its spending expanded to help businesses to thrive post Covid. The EU's Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency, SURE, scheme may be required to help here, but that is perhaps too small. In addition, a range of capital supports will be required for our SME sector. A core function will be saving the maximum number of SMEs affected by the crisis, which are mostly small or tiny firms. I hope Deputies can see the figure about SMEs that I provided in my more lengthy remarks. My final remark concerns readiness for any future crisis. There is a risk of the virus returning. The committee should sponsor risk mitigating scenario analyses linked to actions for key Departments and agencies. Should the virus force lockdowns of our communities in winter 2020 or in 2021, it is incumbent upon us to be prepared. Research is key in helping to offset the impact of the virus on our economy and society. For example, firm-level balance sheet analysis would be very important.Without this knowledge and a policy of supports to offset large-scale liquidations, policymakers are, in effect, working blind when trying to support businesses. Research will inform new models of service delivery for all, including in health, education and business, and will ensure there is a focus to address the specific needs of the most vulnerable in society.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	187	Thank you, Dr. Kinsella. We will now move to the question-and-answer session and the first speaker is Deputy Colm Burke.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	188	My first question is one I put to the other witnesses this morning. We are trying to look at all of the scenarios but one of the issues not being taken into account is a no-deal Brexit. What scenario does it put us in with regard to dealing with the economic challenges we now have and the new economic challenges that could arise if there is no deal on Brexit?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	189	I touched on this point in my opening remarks. For the first time since 1968, when we started doing short-term economic forecasts, the ESRI did not attempt to do a forecast for 2021. Maybe that was cowardice to a certain degree but the reality was that we had the view that there was so much uncertainty - we can tease some of that out - that it was going to be very difficult to do it. In all fairness, agencies such as the Department of Finance have to come up with some sort of forecast but we figured that we did not absolutely have to do it and we chose not to. A year or two years ago, the institute was working very intensively on Brexit matters, often in collaboration with the Department of Finance, and we were coming up with estimates in the event of a no-deal scenario. It is so long ago now that I cannot remember the precise figures but if they were of the order of negative 4% or 5% on GDP, that would not surprise me. The terrifying spectre is that rather than having simply the addition of the downturn as a result of Covid-19, there would be the addition of that downturn plus Brexit and some sort of multiplication of the two. My guess is that this could be the case. It is possible that the impact could be horrendously severe.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	190	The percentage of young people unemployed at the moment is approximately 51% in real terms. We have challenges now that we did not have before. Previously, a lot of young people emigrated but that is not going to happen now. What initiative does the ESRI believe should be in place to target people in that group in order to get them into employment or training?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	191	In work we have done and which we published in the ESRI quarterly economic commentary earlier this year, we showed that there really has been a stark impact in terms of job losses, with young adults experiencing much higher rates of job loss. At its peak, 50% of those aged 18 to 24 lost their job, with that percentage declining with age. The jobs losses really are concentrated among young adults. We know this is a big issue because there is a wealth of economic research which shows that for those who finish school when times are bad, there tend to be long-run scarring effects, as economists call them, on future outcomes. This effect is not just in terms of employment. There has even been evidence to show an increased incidence of criminal charges later in life. This is found in most of the international evidence. It is really important that we look to address that issue and ensure it is highlighted. As for what to do, we have colleagues at the ESRI who have done quite a lot of research on which programmes work and which do not. I am sure we can provide the Deputies with a tighter list of what that research has found. In general, things that bring young adults into contact with the labour market, such as putting them in internships and giving them experience and real-life skills, tend to be more effective than schemes which offer more general training. Those types of schemes which build up firm, specific human capital tend to be the most effective ones. One can see potential options in this regard into the future in terms of things like some of the priorities that have been laid out, for example, for retrofitting houses. Those are the types of opportunities where we might be able to get people into schemes at quite a young age and train them up and for which there may be good prospects in the years ahead.Those are the types of issues one might want to prioritise.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	192	In regard to that 51%, do we have a breakdown of the educational qualifications of the individuals in question? Has a detailed analysis of that been done?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	193	Unfortunately, that information is not in the data that have been published to date. Hopefully, it will be available in the months ahead as the CSO's survey data become available. One would imagine that they would tend to be people with lower levels of education, given the type of sectors that have been hit, but we do not know that for sure at the moment.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	194	We do not even have an indication at this stage.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	195	Not at this stage. Once the labour force survey data being collected by the CSO are published and made available to researchers, we will be able to get a sense of where that burden has fallen heaviest by education.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	196	Should educational institutions provide additional capacity to take people back in order that they can gain additional qualifications?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	197	Educational institutions will play an important role in that. Sometimes more attention is given to higher education institutes than further education institutes. Something that will be particularly obvious in the months ahead is that the focus might be switched around. If we are talking about retraining for, say, energy retrofits, further education institutes may be more suited to providing that type of training than, say, higher education institutes.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	198	Deputy Foley has five minutes.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	199	I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their papers and presentations. We are all very conscious that there is a risk of the virus returning. We discussed that earlier this morning with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council witnesses. I ask Professor Kinsella to elaborate on his view that the committee should sponsor a risk-mitigating scenario analysis linked to actions for key Departments and agencies. What exactly does he envisage in that regard?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	200	In evidence I gave to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight last year, I talked a little about the need for fiscal risk analysis, so looking at specific key categories that the Government spends on and trying to figure out the impact on the economy if, for example, corporation tax were to drop by 5%. Those kinds of fiscal stress tests are done by many agencies throughout the world. The idea here would be that a Department or series of Departments would begin writing a scenario analysis, much like the one the ESRI has just completed, looking precisely at scenarios such as the virus lasting for two years or four years and setting out what would be the impacts and what we would do about it in those scenarios, the idea being that we are aware of the risk and we have a plan to mitigate the impact of the risk should it arrive. They are not necessarily part of the risk registers we often see. They are definitely not part of the scenario analyses that our colleagues in the ESRI produce. The first step is to say, "This could happen"; the second is to say, "It could be this bad"; and the third is to say, "This is what we are going to do about it". Connecting those three steps is very important. The State has responded extremely well to the crisis but it has been in an entirely responsive mode. If we look at areas like supply chain resilience, we need to get much better at having a very resilient, chilled supply chain.

I thank him for that. I have a specific question. Deputy Colm Burke raised the very definite impact of the crisis on younger people, which I accept completely. Has a study been done or are data available on the impact on the tourism sector, specifically the way in which seasonal workers have been impacted? I come from County Kerry, which is a tourism based county. In my view, seasonal workers have been very much left out of the loop. Are there any data to support that view? What measures would Professor Kinsella envisage for seasonal workers? I would say the same applies to people aged over the age of 66 who might remain in business and have been negatively impacted by Covid-19 as well as those aged 66 and over who are in employment.Are there any data to support those studies?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	204	Can I jump in on that and perhaps Dr. Roantree might want to add to it?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	205	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	206	I am not entirely aware that there have been any specific studies, but I will address the question in the following way. One of the great difficulties when talking about the group the Deputy is referring to is that their fate has yet to be determined. We do not know yet precisely when things are going to start and how vibrant the tourist season will be. A certain amount has been lost, but this is very much that sort of group that it may not be as catastrophic as we thought, or it may be. We do not know and we have to keep a watching brief on that. To link to one of the earlier questions when we talked about younger workers, retraining and these sort of issues, one of the great challenges for the State is going to be that if the projected unemployment is going to be as big as expected, the existing retraining infrastructure will simply not be able to cope. We are then into the business of trying to work out how to prioritise and allocate people to training schemes in the reality that not everybody is going to be facilitated. It is at that point we will have to get more data on the skill mix of people and make sure we are concentrating resources on those who face the greatest disadvantage, which could include people who are in sectors or regions that have been severely impacted. To sum up, I am not aware that a study has been done, but a good amount of thought has already been given to some of the issues the Deputy is talking about.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	207	I would suggest it is worthy of study because seasonal workers, particularly, have been the forgotten sector in the current pandemic.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	208	I think the Deputy is right. We know that the job losses have been heaviest in the accommodation and food services sector. A lot of those workers are likely to be seasonal. That is going to create huge issues in that while they might not show up in terms of the people who have lost jobs, they will be people who will not have got jobs they would have otherwise. That relates to the issue of social welfare expenditures. If benefits are tapered on the basis of previous earnings, particularly earnings in January and February, seasonal workers' earnings fluctuate a lot through the year, and it might be that they were below a level of €200 in January and February but would have had much higher levels of earnings during the summer. That is an issue that comes with the tapering of any benefits based on earnings in a particular month or week, particularly concerning those seasonal workers. On the issue of older workers, something we also highlighted in the quarterly economic commentary is that, in addition to the numbers of job losses indicated by the number of claims for the pandemic unemployment benefit, PUP, which a person must be between the ages of 18 and 66 to get and which same conditions also apply to most other jobseeker's benefits, there are tens of thousands of older workers above the age of 66 who might not be showing up in those figures. When the figure for job losses at the peak was 600,000 on the PUP plus another 200-odd thousand on jobseeker's benefit, to that we might add older workers who are not captured in those statistics. That is worth noting.

What do the witnesses think the level of stimulus should be this year? Professor Kinsella mentioned a figure of €6.5 billion. Is that in addition to supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and others? I ask the ESRI the same question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	210	If it is assumed the fall in gross national income is somewhere between 10% and 15%, it strikes me that a stimulus with a multiplier of around 1, that is, a stimulus of approximately 10%, makes sense, which is around €20 billion. We have already spent something like €8 billion, so I would imagine a stimulus north of €10 billion makes sense, but between €10 billion and €12 billion is something I would suggest. The figure of €6.5 billion was my computation of Ireland's amount that will come from European programmes alone.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	211	If I could come at it a slightly different way, the sort of figures being mentioned, such as €10 billion, sound perfectly reasonable.To add a note of caution, however, there is always a danger in these sorts of things if a figure is decided upon first and then decisions are made on how to spend it. I will give some examples, and I have touched on this already. While there is a commitment to retraining, there is no point stating €2 billion or €3 billion will be spent on retraining if there are no classes, teachers and all of those things in place. Likewise, the institute got into some trouble some years ago when we criticised a national development plan because it could, potentially, be inflationary. Spending buckets of money where there may be bottlenecks, of whatever nature, does not make a great deal of sense either.  Several design features are critical. Figures such as €10 billion sound perfectly reasonable.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	213	Those funds should be spread across things such as infrastructural investment, particularly with green and housing components. It is a really good idea to do the sort of retraining we spoke about as well. Business supports are really important but let us be careful in designing them so we ensure we direct those supports at businesses that have a future, rather than those that do not.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	214	Perhaps we can look at those business supports. I have been quite critical of the Government and I believe we are way behind the curve, looking at where other countries have supported businesses, and SMEs in particular, because they are the backbone of our sector. The grants available are small in comparison with other areas, including in our closest neighbour in the North, where grants to affected sectors amount to £25,000, rates are being waived for a year, bounce-back loans are hugely drawn down because they have a 0% rate of interest and no repayments for 12 months, compared to the 4.5% rate of interest being offered here. What types of supports does Professor Barrett believe are required by SMEs? I refer to a stimulus package, including grants and access to credit.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	215	Again, I do not have a clear answer to that question, because we would need to know much about the micro-details of many of these firms to give a comprehensive answer. I have two quick reflections, however. We wrote about one of these concerns in one of our ESRI outputs. In the early stages, the focus seemed to be very much on loan facilities. We all learned the lesson from previous experiences that SMEs having more and more-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	217	-----borrowing attached to them almost inevitably meant that they were not going to emerge from a crisis. We can pass on more information on this topic after this session. Several of my colleagues had been examining SME financing pre-Covid-19, and one of the things we noticed was that there was already a reluctance among Irish SMEs to take on board debt. That was before there were difficulties. If there was already reluctance, it always struck us as highly unlikely that a loan-driven approach to this issue was going to succeed. At some level, we must design measures that get cash to businesses without burdening them. Most economists speak about this problem. The great challenge of industrial policy, through big, medium and small companies, is how to differentiate and ensure that resources will be directed in a way that will really assist companies to blossom, rather than merely subsidising companies.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	218	That is a fair question, and I will ask Dr. Kinsella about it. Trying to get what we are going to do pitch perfect in the middle of the pandemic would burn time while companies close. We will always have what is called dead weight in some of these scenarios. Given what was mentioned by the representatives from the ESRI about the level of loans, I note that more than €4 billion in loans have so far been promised, whereas the grants have been as low as €250 million. Where does Professor Kinsella see the balance needed regarding supporting our SMEs in the next year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	219	The first thing to note is how poor those data are on the SME sector. The latest research from the Central Bank on this topic uses a survey from 2017, with data from 2016. It is fair to say, therefore, that we do not really know what an accurate picture of the SME sector looks like. That is a plea for better data and more research on this issue. The second point is that we need to understand the balance sheet of a firm, which is the composition of a firm's assets and liabilities. In that situation, given we are not going to have those data any time soon, it behoves us to think about direct grants to firms and accepting the inevitable dead weight loss. There will be a cost and money will be thrown away on this. However, the benefit of that large-scale grant policy will be that many firms which would otherwise have been forced to liquidate will stay alive. These assets are not fundamentally valueless. The firm just does not have the ability to service them at a particular point in time. I would caution everyone against letting the market do its thing during a pandemic. It behoves the Government to support businesses that are in trouble at the moment. We should consider large-scale grant programmes to the extent that we can. We can have clawbacks and bring in equity releases later on. There are many details in the design of policy. As a basic measure, however, we should seriously consider large-scale grant aid to SMEs, particularly medium-sized enterprises, which in my view have been left behind.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	220	I thank the witness. The ESRI's summer economic commentary made for very interesting reading. I was especially struck by the commentary on supports, namely, the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme. The report warned that ending these schemes or tapering them off would lead to mortgage arrears issues. I think the word "inevitably" was used. It also stated that savings resulting from this could aid recovery and prevent a temporary downturn from turning into something permanent. Will the witnesses elaborate on their views on when these schemes should be ended, given the Government projections predicting that 250,000 people who have lost their jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic will still be unemployed at Christmas this year, with many still unemployed in 2021?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	221	It is true that the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme will need to be tapered off eventually. Let me start with the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme. At the moment, eligibility for this scheme is based on firm revenue. This contrasts with the UK scheme under which firms had to furlough their employees fully to benefit. The upside of this is that firms can continue to have employees work part time for them, meaning their skills do not depreciate and they contribute to the supply of goods and services while they avail of these schemes. This is good for employee retention in the long run. The difficulty here is that withdrawing the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme based on the eligibility criterion of firm revenue creates a disincentive for firms to increase their turnover. That is certainly a situation that policymakers will want to avoid in any recovery scenario. The question is how to taper this off. One option is to proceed by sector, or alternatively to proceed in stages as the economy is reopening. The timing is difficult. Move too soon and some firms that may have been viable given a little more time will go under. Move too late and the dead weight and the cost of the scheme will really increase. The difficulties in withdrawing the scheme are mainly in the timing. I do not have an exact answer on when that should happen, but it will be critical in the design of a withdrawal.

I have several questions for Professor Kinsella. I really enjoyed reading his paper. There are lots of interesting ideas there about a broader and fairer tax system and increasing and broadening the tax take, which I would like to dive into a bit more. Given the current financial situation, anything we can do to improve the country's finances is welcome. I notice that Professor Kinsella mentioned increased taxes on higher earners and property taxes. He also referred to decreasing taxes on capital gains to stimulate transactions. There is also a reference to reducing inheritance taxes on a one-off basis. I thought that was an interesting point. He suggests introducing a seventh VAT period in November and December. I assume that has something to do with the Christmas tax take. I would like to understand a little bit more about those three points.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	223	I thank the Deputy. Some of the items on that list were intended to get money in now.For example, we know January is a big month for VAT payments. VAT is paid every two months so there are six months in which VAT is paid for most firms. Introducing a seventh such month would move money that would otherwise be booked in January into that seventh month. It is a means of trying to prop up the 2020 revenue to a certain extent. The idea behind temporarily lowering capital gains tax is to increase the number of transactions made and create turnover in the system. The idea behind a reduction in inheritance tax is to combat people simply waiting. The behavioural science, much of which has been sponsored by the ESRI and Professor Pete Lunn and his colleagues, shows that in conditions of increased uncertainty, people stop. They do not buy houses, sell properties, move businesses along or transfer farms. In that case, the State is starved of taxation revenue not because the economic need is not there or that there is not supply and demand but simply because of increased uncertainty. Those are my thoughts around it. We must consider things that could reduce the level of uncertainty or induce a kind of economic behaviour to increase the revenue that the State receives over this pandemic period. As the Deputy will be aware, this is a serious fiscal challenge. These measures may be effective or they may not.

Does the settlement on existing tax appeals mean doing a deal? Is that like an amnesty or how would it work?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	225	Yes. I think the most recent estimate was that there are €3.7 billion of extant tax appeals. That money will come to the State eventually and it makes sense to me that we should look carefully at how we might do that.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	226	The report from the ESRI stated that PUP leaves some families with more disposable income out of work than they had when they were in work and raised questions that we have talked about a bit already as to how we scale back the payment. I want to pick up on the phrase "careful consideration" that was used by Professor Barrett in his opening statement in respect of how to unwind the payment. There has been a lot of focus on a student who works one day a week in the local bar or at the weekend and is now getting a full PUP. There has been less focus on the fact that the same student might rely on full-time summer work which is now unavailable to fund his or her next year in college. Such a student could be pushed out of third level education without those funds. As was cited earlier, there are also many pensioners who were working to supplement their State pension before the Covid-19 crisis, were unable to avail of the PUP and struggled because of that. There are also people who will be unable to return to work after the Covid-19 crisis for multiple reasons, including childcare and so on. Poverty rates, and particularly child poverty, might increase. Can Professor Barrett unpack the phrase "carefully consider" a little? While being mindful of the precarious nature of much of the work with which we are dealing, what does careful consideration consist of and has the ESRI analysed how that relates to something like universal basic income?
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	227	I think Dr. Roantree would like to answer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	228	I will answer the soft part of the question and leave the more technical and difficult part to Dr. Roantree. I will give an overview before I hand over to Dr. Roantree. The primary question the ESRI had about PUP was how good a policy this was in cushioning the incomes of people who were losing jobs. The answer was that this was a really good policy in cushioning things. If something is done quickly, there might be design flaws and if something is made to be generous, it could well be the case that certain people benefit from it at a level that they would not otherwise. On balance, to the extent that this was a positive social programme, it did a good job. The evidence that the institute presented was to the effect that very small numbers of people were doing incredibly well out of the payment. On balance, this was a very positive programme. I will hand over to Dr. Roantree on the specifics of the tapering issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	229	One thing that the ESRI has been highlighting is that the payment was particularly important in cushioning income loss for people who live alone, lone parents, lower income groups comprising people in the bottom fifth of income distribution and renters. Our research showed that the payment was particularly important for those three groups. Other work that the institute has done and published in the past few weeks has shown that those groups spend disproportionately large amounts of their total spending on essentials, primarily housing costs and groceries.One thing that we have been highlighting is that if the Government moves to a position where the PUP is reduced, tapered, or withdrawn, it might also be appropriate to look at increasing support for other benefits, and in particular, housing costs. The one that comes to mind and is designed for this very purpose is rent supplement. There was some increase in the generosity of that payment, which was due to expire, but it has been extended again. I do not believe that people are particularly aware this support is there and available to them and has been expanded. The details were not on the Citizens' Information Board website, or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection website, until recently. It is these type of things that we are drawing attention to, in that if this payment is going to be reduced for the reasons that people raise about work incentives, or suchlike, then one might look at increasing housing supports, in a corresponding way.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	230	I welcome the witnesses. This is a fascinating discussion but it is a pity that I only have five minutes to put some questions and have a discussion on these very important policy instruments and the impact that they are having. The ESRI has done incredibly important work on the cushioning provided by the PUP. The evidence is there and has been very important to inform the policy debate about the options we have at the moment in supporting people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, or of the businesses that have employed them. Has the ESRI done formal modelling of the impact that the introduction of a two-tier PUP payment system would have on those who will be most adversely affected come the end of June? Are the witnesses of the view that the single-tier PUP system should have been maintained at least until such time as the sectors that have been most adversely affected have more have reopened in a more substantial way?  On the TWSS, Dr. Doorley made an important point that there are firms back up and running now that no longer meet the eligibility threshold. Have the witnesses a view on how the scheme should be tapered and how it may be reformed? We should seriously consider a customised tailored sector by sector, well-designed, short-time working scheme to try to assist employers dipping their toe in the market over the next few months to take people back on a short-term basis, as the economy continues to reopen.  On the national minimum wage, the Low Pay Commission will make an important recommendation to Government in the middle of July, as it is statutorily obliged to do. We know from evidence developed by the ESRI, and all of the international evidence, that small incremental, progressive increases to national minimum wages do not cost jobs. They have an impact on hours worked but they tend not to cost jobs. Have our witnesses a view at this point in time and have they done any analysis of the impact that an increase in the minimum wage may have on jobs and on particular sectors, given that there is a preponderance of women and younger people working in the sectors where the national minimum wage is most apparent? I have a final question for both the ESRI and Professor Kinsella. As regards the massive subsidies that will be designed over the coming weeks, which are necessary to support certain economic sectors, are they of the view that this presents an opportunity for the State to attach important conditionality to ensure that key public policy ambitions get over the line, for example, respect for labour and environmental rights, and so on? Many other European states are taking this approach; we do not seem to be taking that at all. We have an opportunity to make our country better, and some conditions should be attached to the enormous resources that will be brought forward over the next number of weeks.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	231	I will make two quick remarks. I will then hand over to my colleagues, Dr. Roantree, on the PUP, and to Dr. Doorley, on the TWSS. The Deputy has done this horrible thing where he has asked six or seven different questions.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	232	We have very little time.

#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	234	Would Professor Barrett like to ask Dr. Doorley to respond? All economists are comfortable, and it is part of the textbook learning, that while a deficit is temporary and there is an expectation that the natural forces in the economy will erase it, there is no need to move into an austerity period or anything like that. The nature of the downturn is very different this time compared with last time and interest rates are incredibly low. Moving into next year, I do not think there is a problem. However, most economists would begin to worry if there was no evidence that the deficit was going to be closed over time and that we would get into a situation where we were permanently running a structural deficit but that is not austerity, that is basic housekeeping. That is why there is now a consensus.  As a final brief point, the last time, austerity kicked in because no one would lend us any money. We have much more choice this time. I will hand over to Dr. Doorley.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	235	Linking welfare payments to some sort of index is something the ESRI always highlights in its post-budget analysis in October. When we do a comparison of what has been announced in the budget, we tend to compare it to what would have alternatively happened had the budget been indexed in line with either wage or price growth. That is a sensible comparison because we know that earnings typically increase year on year, unless we are in a deflationary period, as do prices. Comparing, for instance, the 2019 budget with the 2020 budget without changing the parameters of the 2019 budget to reflect the expected earnings or price growth in 2020 gives a somewhat distorted view of the budgetary changes. Linking welfare payments to some sort of index, be it wage indices, price growth or some sort of welfare index, is reasonable insofar as it prevents divergences in inequality. It would stop wage growth overtaking welfare payments. We saw that during that during the great recession when there were welfare cuts; when wages started to recover, welfare did not recover quite so quickly, which led to an increase in income inequality. This is an issue we tend to highlight in our post-budget analysis and there is some merit to it.
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	236	I thank both witnesses. Dr. Kinsella's paper noted that corporation taxes are a key risk to the State. How can we manage the vulnerability and volatility of corporation taxes?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	237	First, they will be managed for us. There is a risk that we will lose some proportion of the corporate tax take through European digital tax changes. On the positive side, these revenues keep growing for various reasons. Viewing corporation tax receipts as temporary is wise and it suggests they should be used on things such as capital spending and paying debt down, or even pandemic unemployment payments. Increases in corporation tax revenue probably should not be used to pay for child benefit increases, which would continue on forever. The other major aspect of corporation tax revenue is how quickly it has grown. To expect it to grow at that speed in the medium term would be fiscal folly. We should not do that; we got ourselves into trouble with that last time. To echo Professor Barrett's point, if the Government gets itself into the situation where it is taking in less than it is spending for a significant period, that is when we have austerity. I would define austerity quite differently to fiscal consolidation. Austerity is increasing taxes and decreasing Government spending in order to regain the confidence of the bond markets, whereas fiscal consolidation is where one pulls revenue and taxes together in order to ensure that one does not have to do austerity. I do not think that we will be in a situation where we have to impose austerity so long as we are very careful that the debts we build up now are used for highly productive purposes, rather than balancing the books on items such as public sector wages.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	239	I thank the ESRI and Dr. Kinsella for their contributions.As has been said, five minutes is too short to ask the questions one wants in a very interesting debate. On the Covid payment and the income supports, do the witnesses agree that the talk of tapering off or even cutting the payment for those who are in receipt of it is folly at the current time or in the foreseeable future? The sectors that are going to recover are going to recover and people will go back to work, but the people who will lose out are those who will be unable to gain employment through absolutely no fault of their own. In fact they will specifically not be able to regain employment because of correct decisions the Government has made on public health measures, and their inability to return to work will be dictated by those Government measures. They are identifiable sectors such as tourism, aviation, taxi drivers, arts and leisure, and people who interact very closely with others. Is it not folly at the level of justice for those people but also from a macroeconomic point of view, because the more money they have in their pocket, the more it will boost demand at a time when we desperately need to boost demand in the economy to get things going and to keep things going? The private sector has stopped investing to a very substantial extent. I would like Professor Barrett to comment on this. According to the Government there is a 37.5% fall in private sector investment, which is way out of line in proportion to the overall reduction in growth that is being projected. The corporate sector is saying it is not taking any risks or investing. Against that background we need even more stimulus at every level and the State must step in and compensate for the lack of investment that is coming for the foreseeable future from the private sector. That is against a background where public spending in Ireland was already way below EU levels, even coming into Covid, but against a background of collapse in private sector investment, surely there is an even greater urgency for heavy State intervention, State investment and to keep people's incomes up to ensure demand continues. One last point in that regard is that while there are very obvious losers in the current situation, that is, workers in the industries I mentioned - arts, leisure, taxi drivers and transport - there are some winners as well. The pharmaceutical industry, the IT sector and financial services have been largely unaffected by this, as well as some of the big retailers and probably some of the big companies in the agrifood sector. They have probably done very well in the current situation. Should we not think about some taxes on the super profits they are making to redirect some resources towards those areas that need help?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	240	I will give a quick response. I am reluctant to say precisely at what level the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, should be. That is ultimately a political choice. The role of analytical agencies such as the ESRI is to do things like calculate such parameters as the effect of a policy, the cost of it and who benefits. We try to provide that information, but ultimately it is up to this body to decide whether the PUP should be €500 a week, €200 a week or whatever other level.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	244	I am suggesting clearly that it is up to Members to make that decision. The important thing is that if the Government is going to keep it at €350 forever more, it does raise the question of why the minimum wage is approximately €10 and if that should be increased as well. There can be a series of interactions and the Government must ensure that, in a sense, policies are all aligned. One can make the case that perhaps the PUP should be €350 and the minimum wage should be approximately €20 an hour and that could be consistent, but it is up to the ESRI to point out where policies interact and where there might be difficulties. On the point Deputy Boyd Barrett made about private sector investment, I agree it has collapsed, but this is precisely why all in the economics profession are talking about a vastly enhanced role for Government to borrow the sort of money that is required and to have a stimulus. It is a classic time for Keynesian economics, which is well and truly in fashion.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	245	I call Deputy Shanahan who has five minutes.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	246	I thank both of our guests. First, I will direct a few questions to Professor Barrett. Professor Cal Muckley of UCD has proposed a social progress indicator, in the Programme for Government, which measures both the quality and cost of State services. What are his thoughts on the matter? Will it be an effective tool? Will it ensure we can engage policy, as a result, to create the reform of costs in the public sector?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	247	Can I ask for a clarification on the question because I did not quite understand?
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	248	Yes, of course.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	249	Professor Cal Muckley of UCD has proposed a social progress indicator, in the Programme for Government, to consider the costs and quality of public services. Does Professor Barrett, from his own point of view, think this is a measure that we can use to analyse the cost and delivery of public services?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	250	There has been a lot of discussion in recent times on what is measured by GDP, incomes and all these sort of things. If I have understood the question, I think this is moving in the direction where measures of well-being are increasingly sought in terms of evaluating policy. The best example is the French where the Macron Government has tried to develop these things as has the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Jacinta Ardern. Economists, as a profession, have become increasingly aware of this issue. I started writing papers, before I became the director of the institute, with titles including the terms mental health and well-being. In terms of the Covid discussion and the notion of public services post-Covid, that idea that we should try to maximise some measure of well-being is very relevant and is gaining traction. Professor Kinsella may have some bigger views than I on this matter.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	251	Sorry, I rather hoped that this would be used as a measure of costs versus value; we will see how it develops. Professor Barrett, at the end of his statement today, said that he foresees that an increase in the total tax take will be needed as the programme evolves over three years. Where does he see the tax heads landing? I ask because I think that corporation tax is going to drop because the profitability within the SME sector is going to drop and costs are going to rise. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	252	My earlier remarks to Deputy Boyd Barrett apply here. It is really up to this House to decide where the additional tax is. We simply pointed out what is an almost mechanical or arithmetic fact that so much of the discussion post-Covid has been around the enhanced role for the State in so many aspects of life. The logical extension of that is that if there is going to be a bigger role for the State then the tax take must increase. Again, the institute has tried to do its job in this area over the years where we have looked at various measures of taxation. We have tried to look at the economic impacts of various bits of taxation. Questions always arise such as whether, if one puts a tax on X, Y and Z, one will choke economic activity. We have done a lot of work over the years trying to get a handle on what taxes work and do not work. Ultimately, as I said, it is really a discussion for this House but I do not think it can be avoided. At the point when tax increases may have to be looked at, they should not be interpreted as austerity measures but should simply be interpreted as measures to expand the role of the State.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	253	I thank the professor. I note that Dr. Kinsella said in his opening remarks that we could run a deficit of up to €30 billion but earlier today Mr. Sebastian Barnes said it would be a maximum of €28 billion. Today, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has talked about refinancing some bonds that is has at 0% or 2%. How comfortable are we in a stable interest rate environment going forward? In other words, can we keep borrowing money at close to 0% or less than 2%?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	254	For the short term, the answer is yes. By the short term I mean one to three years. The real risk comes when the money that we borrowed last week - €6 billion - has to be refinanced in ten years time. There is absolutely no model of what future interest rates on sovereign debt are going to be. If the stock of debt is very high and the economy is not growing then it is unlikely we will be able to refinance it in the future at the rates at which we borrowed.Therefore, that kind of roll-over risk is there. The Department of Finance is alive to that risk and will do its best to manage in that context.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	255	I have one more quick question to Dr. Kinsella. In his address today, he highlighted the work that was done between the University of Limerick, UL, and some commercial interests in terms of personal protective equipment, PPE, development, which I am sure was very welcome. I would highlight to him that Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, has done something also with the support of commercial interests and the HSE. Perhaps he might consider having a look at that programme and endorsing it also.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	256	I am big fan of universities getting involved in helping people. The example of WIT is salutary, as well as that of UL.

I note in his statement Professor Barrett states, "In the severe scenario the economic shock is even more stark with a second wave of the virus". If we have a second wave, should the country only shut down where the virus has struck worst or can we afford another national shutdown?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	258	I will give a straight answer to that. Everybody is now an epidemiologist. In the old days everybody was an amateur economist. Everybody is now an amateur epidemiologist.

#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	261	Maybe from an economic point of view.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	262	One cannot divorce the two. Often things have been pitched as though there is economics on the one hand and public health on the other but many economists argued from the outset that an economy in which a virus is running rampant will not be a successful economy. As I have been hanging out with some epidemiologists as part of my work feeding into NPHET, I will break my rule.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	263	They get all the fun.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	264	There is no doubt but we have learnt so much more about the virus, even in the past three months. When things kicked off in March, we really did not have a great understanding of this. There is still much we do not know. This notion of having much more targeted lockdowns came up in a discussion. One of the colleagues sitting around the table discussing epidemiology matters was making the point that when one has viruses in animals, it is clear that one locks down the group of animals and simply makes sure that they do not move around. At the time, it seemed inconceivable that we would think about a human virus in the same way we would think about a virus affecting animals but we can now imagine a situation where, geographically, in some shape or form, if a virus could be contained, it would be better to contain one part of the country rather than the whole country. We should be moving in a direction of having much more surgical lockdowns and surgical intervention to the extent that we can.

While 11 million people visited us from across the world last year, this year it looks like it is the Irish market only. With the best will in the world, a population of just over 4 million will not be able to compensate the loss of 7 million visitors. Is it definite that tourism will take a massive hit leading to significant job losses and closures throughout the country? What would be the economic benefit of a 0% tourism VAT rate? If not a rate of 0%, how low can Ireland go without European approval?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	266	Something we highlighted in previous work around budget time is that increasingly, economic research is showing that when VAT is cut, it tends to lead through to higher mark-ups for business owners. When VAT then goes back up, that tends to be passed on to consumers. That seems to be what economic research is now telling us happens. From that point of view, while a VAT cut might help stimulate activity in certain sectors, it might also lead to a permanently higher price level and that is something that is important to feed into the mix. In addition, while VAT cuts are well targeted in terms of encouraging economic activity, at the same time, if there are many businesses which cannot engage in economic activity because of public health measures or because they are affected like that, those businesses will not benefit from a VAT cut. From that point of view, it is not particularly well targeted towards the businesses which are suffering most from the enactment of public health measures. One might stimulate tourism a bit by cutting VAT but at the same time there might be more targeted measures, for example, via the rates system or grants.I am a little a bit cautious about advocating cutting VAT as a measure because there are some things that should be taken into account in the longer run. Such temporary VAT cuts have a way of turning into long-running VAT cuts, which then cause issues themselves.

How does Dr. Roantree propose this should happen?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	268	Perhaps Dr. Doorley can answer that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	269	I will deal with this issue and Deputy Nash's point about short-time work schemes in the longer term at the same time. There is a very good example of a short-time work scheme in Germany, the Kurzarbeit scheme, which is credited with helping Germany weather the great recession a lot better than some of its neighbours did. The idea is a little bit like the TWSS. Firms can adjust the number of hours their employees work in line with demand. They can make short-term adjustments to labour supply to match demand. This allows them flexibility. The Government then picks up part of the remaining wage bill. It pays for the additional hours people are not working. This scheme has been very successful in Germany. It does have some downsides. There are inefficiencies that can creep in. Employees are sort of tied to particular firms through this scheme, which may prevent reallocation to a more productive sector. Transforming the TWSS into something like a short-time work scheme might prevent employees who are working in sectors that are no longer viable looking for work, or retraining in order to work, in other sectors. The scheme has merits but it must be kept in mind that there may also be some long-term downsides.

To start with a slight aside, Professor Barrett made a throwaway remark that the ESRI is not projecting forward to 2021. As the primary and most respected body in this area - without meaning any disrespect to any of the other agencies involved in this type of work - is that appropriate? Will Professor Barrett justify that remark? Is he effectively saying that he believes the projections of other groups are not valid because there is no way to make such projections? Allowing for the structure of the ESRI and the funding it receives, does he believe it has an obligation to get into the saddle and do that work?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	271	That is a perfectly reasonable question. Let me put it like this: we have not made a projection this year so far. From memory, we were the first agency to come out with a stab at what this would do in 2020. We did our job at that point and did it well but, since then, we have taken the decision that the degree of uncertainty around a whole range of things means that we would question how meaningful any projection would be. As the situation unfolds, and certainly when we do our next quarterly economic commentary, we will present work for 2021. To refer back to something about which Professor Kinsella was talking, because we have a macro modelling capacity many other agencies do not have, I expect that we will carry out a more elaborate set of exercises and scenario analyses. That is just to set the record straight on that.
#ColmBrophy	unknown-#ColmBrophy-party	unknown-#ColmBrophy-dob	unknown-#ColmBrophy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	272	I am glad to hear that because we need that information. It might be wrong but that is the thing about projections; one takes that risk. It is, however, absolutely vital that work is done. I will come back to certain issues that have already been highlighted. Professor Kinsella mentioned one of the primary ones. I worry that many of my colleagues, across the board, advocate spending and spending. We need to spend and I agree that a Keynesian approach is the right approach to deal with this but, as we know from many exchanges we have had over the years, the State is highly indebted. It has a real issue in that regard.Perhaps Dr. Kinsella could answer this. I do not think it is a matter of years before the international markets will start to look at individual member states of the European Union and other states around the world and refuse to continue funding this unless they see meaningful adjustments to how the borrowing is taking place. The impact of that on this country would be catastrophic. Should we address the borrowing issue sooner than two to three years out to maintain our ability to borrow in the longer cycle, particularly to borrow at attractive rates?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	273	The ECB this week said that it would purchase any and all assets required to keep bond yields as low as possible. As long as we stay part of a monetary union whose central bank commits to that, I think we will be okay. One to three years is appropriate for that. If we start pulling back on our borrowing too quickly, we create a gap between our spending and taxes. That necessitates very serious discussions about what programmes will not get funded. There is an important distinction between this time and the last time. Here, there is no moral hazard component. There is no "we all partied" view of things. The truth about it is that the virus has hit everybody. I do not think there will be a constituency for cuts of that kind. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is targeting fiscal consolidation after four or five years, which is probably appropriate. We get past the disaster phase, up to 2022 or 2023, and after that we begin paring back the level of stimulus. That stance is broadly appropriate assuming a V-shaped or U-shaped recession, which is what the real-time data are showing it might look like. While I agree that it is a timing issue, I would be very cautious about paring back the borrowing requirement now because it would necessitate fewer public services in the short term.
#ColmBrophy	unknown-#ColmBrophy-party	unknown-#ColmBrophy-dob	unknown-#ColmBrophy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	274	I agree with that and it is something I would like to see. I wanted to make sure that Dr. Kinsella and the ESRI are of the view that we have that capacity. It is vitally important that we spend now. The ESRI alluded to the necessity for an increase in taxes. Effectively, we are looking for an increase in the revenue derived from taxes. I think the most effective way of getting that is what we did last time, which was to grow the economy, getting people back into work and doing the policies which the Government is advocating. That will negate the need for a rise in the rate of tax. Is that something the witnesses could see as an effective way of dealing with the necessity to increase tax revenue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	275	Certainly over the medium term, yes. Over the short term, however, to speak to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, there is a shortfall in private sector investment. We know from the work of Kate Ivory and others in The Economic and Social Review, which I referenced, that in the current environment investing in public resources would be very advantageous and would derive a benefit of twice what the Government spends. It is vital to look at this in its sectoral context. For example, if it looks like the tourism sector is going to be in trouble and a large-scale retrofit will be needed, maybe the State could provide grants to have tourism facilities upgraded while the downturn continues. It is possible to use the investment to transform the structure of the economy in the short term, which would be very good.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	277	I will answer quickly. I was making a more fundamental point. As the economy grows and improves, more tax revenue will come in; there is no doubt about that. The point I was making is that in terms of the size of the State, by which I mean the proportion of gross domestic product, GDP, that is taken in tax revenue, Ireland is at the lower end compared with other states.One reason is that we have, collectively as a society in some shape or form, decided to tax at a particular level and provide public services at a particular level, which is a perfectly legitimate, democratic decision that has been made. If there is a move to vastly enhancing the scale of our public interventions, and this is the point I was making about everything from education to childcare to basic incomes and so on, each of which has tremendous merit, the mathematical certainty is that we will have to raise our tax share to be in line with, for example, continental European countries. There is a big decision to be made.
#ColmBrophy	unknown-#ColmBrophy-party	unknown-#ColmBrophy-dob	unknown-#ColmBrophy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	278	I follow exactly what the professor is saying. The modelling of the impact of Brexit on the economy was done almost exclusively in the booming economy we had until the end of February, that is, with effective full employment, low inflation and everything going ahead. Has any modelling been done to try to show what impact a no-deal Brexit would have on a vastly more weakened economy in the current circumstances? Are the percentage figures for the potential impact mentioned earlier by our guests still realistic or is there a need to re-examine the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on the type of economy we have now?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	279	For the modelling that is done at the institute, a macro model is used and the data that inform that macro model go back over a 30 or 35-year period. The modellers at the institute try to get a broader picture of the economy and the relationships therein. The results are presented in terms of what Brexit will do relative to where the economy is at a point in time. We take a broader picture of economic relationships. One of the great challenges in doing such exercises is that the models work reasonably well for growth rates of 1%, 2% or 3%, or within what we might call normal parameters. This sort of economic modelling becomes very difficult when the structure of the economy has almost been changed overnight, so it will be difficult to conduct these sorts of exercises. To return to the earlier point the Deputy raised, these are the sorts of considerations we will grapple with over the summer to see how we will modify the analysis to determine what Brexit will mean for the current economy. Only yesterday I was talking to my counterpart at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in London. We hope to get together to conduct some sort of an exercise on this. Without doing the modelling, I can say it will be a frightening result, in summary.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	280	Our guests from IFAC earlier made the point that at some phase in the course of this recovery, which should be phased out over the course of three years, there will be a need for increased taxes. The council made it clear that any new commitments that might arise will require reductions in other areas or there will have to be increased taxes. Professor Kinsella stated more or less the same, namely, that taxes will have to be increased. He gave consideration to increases in property tax, to introducing a wealth tax and to increasing taxes for higher earners. Will the professor elaborate on that? After Covid-19, who are the high earners? Can individual householders afford higher levels of property tax? As for the filthy rich whom everybody seems to talk about, who are they, where are they and how much tax do they pay?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	281	Who are the wealthy who should be taxed? Many households over the past two or three months have actually saved quite significant amounts of money because they have not been going out or doing many activities. The savings rate across the world has been booming and Ireland is no different. Is there scope for people to pay more at the higher levels? Absolutely. Who they are will be typed by sector. This is why this sectorial study, as I mentioned to Deputy Nash, will be important. Different sectors of the economy will need to be looked at carefully. I support the idea of a wealth tax because we do not really tax wealth that much in this country. Property is the main form of wealth in our economy. An expanded property tax would be better in terms of creating a solid tax base. On higher taxes generally, I wrote my statement last week. The programme for Government, which was just announced, envisages a much larger State, not a temporary increase in the provision of the State, which is what the fiscal council was talking about. It envisages a much a larger, more permanent expansion of the State. That has to be paid for by either increasing the tax base or increasing the rate of tax which people currently pay. It is good and welcome news that there will be a commission on taxation and welfare in the upcoming programme for Government - if it is agreed, of course. That is the place to have the conversation about how to pay for the larger State that many want.

Is that possible while continuing to borrow at the current rate? Dr. Kinsella mentioned in his opening statement about increases in PRSI.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	283	There will have to be tax increases for sure. The employer's PRSI rate is quite low in Ireland relative to our comparator set of countries in the OECD. There is certainly scope to increase taxes there. Between the next two to four years, we will certainly see some tax increases. There is scope there. Again however, whether there is scope across the entire economy or whether there can be rebates and so forth is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	284	In his response earlier, Dr. Kinsella mentioned employers again, which takes us back to the chart on page four of his submission. It talks about SMEs in terms of the micro, the small, the medium and the large. It will be difficult if we are expecting employers to pay more taxes and recover at the same time, particularly when some are still recovering from the financial crash. Will Dr. Kinsella explain this graph to me?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	285	That graph is taken from a Central Bank report. It is based on 2017 data, the latest that is available but quite out of date. There is a research requirement to get better data on the actual shape of the SME sector. Many firms in many sectors have been minimally affected, relatively, by the crisis. The ones very badly affected have been in many respects supported and saved by the State. That is right, good and correct. However, given that the State is showing a tremendous level of solidarity with households and firms, it is not too much to expect that the State will require increased contributions to provide better services. It must be remembered we are not talking about paying off bust banks or odious debt to bondholders. This is about an increased and larger health system to deal with the pandemic as well as increased spending on education and higher education. As a friend of mine said, we are bailing each other out. That will need to continue over the medium term at least.

It is true that it exists but it is less true in respect of the micro-businesses throughout the country. They are still grappling with a huge debt. They are still grappling with the debt created by Covid-19. In the retail sector, for example, a business might be carrying stock worth €1 million that has gone out of season and it is expected to invest in the next lot of stock to try to keep its doors open. The same can apply in manufacturing. Manufacturers are trying to address Christmas markets now and are finding it hard to get started again because they are carrying a debt and the cost of raw materials. As the supports offered by the Government have had little positive impact on the retail sector, it is hard to see how the affected businesses can be expected to pay extra taxes. While it might be for the greater good, they might not be able to afford it. I was quite shocked by the statement this morning, and by that of Professor Barrett now, on the analysis of the SME sector. There is poor analysis of what it actually is and how it is actually affected. Maybe the ESRI representatives will comment on that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	287	The Deputy's question is actually quite interesting. Let me link the relevant points. Earlier the Deputy asked whether extra taxes, if imposed, should be wealth taxes or taxes for higher earners, and then he pointed, very understandably, to the notion that if the new wave of taxes is to involve increased employer contributions through PRSI, for example, it would have potentially damaging effects. One can certainly make that case, and it is quite understandable. Clearly, there are very large firms that could handle this but there are many smaller enterprises for which it would be quite difficult. Therefore, I understand the analysis, but if we agree collectively with the simple mathematics to the effect that if the State is to be expanded or extended in the sense that we will have to collect more tax - maybe we do not - we still have to come together and decide how we are to do that. Maybe the Deputy does not agree with that but if for the purpose of discussion we take it that we are to have more tax revenues, wealth taxes are quite interesting in that there is a general understanding that they tend to have the least impact on economic activity. For example, if a worker is taxed very heavily he or she might work less, and if somebody who is consuming or investing is taxed he or she might do less, but wealth taxes tend to be what we describe as the least distortionary. Ireland is very unusual in having a very low level of taxation of wealth. There is a great difficulty in this regard, on which I can forward the details. A colleague in the ESRI, Professor Martina Lawless, analysed this matter a number of years ago. She examined various wealth components and asked how broad the tax would have to be before there would be a meaningful revenue stream. The reality is that if housing is excluded, a wealth tax in Ireland will yield very little, but if it is included it will yield a lot. These are the issues we will face. On the discussion on the interactions between taxation, welfare, employer PRSI and how we will fund enhanced welfare payments, living wages and all these sorts of things, it is really good that these subjects are going to be discussed by one commission on taxation and social welfare but I sometimes believe the pensions issue could also be part of the discussion to the extent that we might also be asking people, through auto-enrolment, to contribute more to their pension and asking employers to do more in this regard also. Therefore, there is quite a complicated blend.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	289	As other Deputies have said, we should be discussing this at considerably greater length, and maybe we will.

Has the ESRI carried out any analysis recently of unsecured household debt?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	291	Not to my knowledge. I do not know whether Dr. Roantree or Dr. Doorley is aware of any.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	292	As part of an ongoing project, colleagues who are not here today, namely, Dr. Conor O'Toole and Professor Kieran McQuinn, are considering the possible impact of Covid on rent arrears and housing costs.That is yet to be finalised but when it is, it will be published.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	293	I had a meeting recently with the head of the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS. She talked about the possibility of a tsunami of household debt hitting people, especially from low income households, when the moratorium or holiday on rent, mortgages and other unpaid bills ends. It is an issue that will warrant some attention and we will have to figure out how we deal with that. I have a number of questions about carbon taxes. I know the ESRI modelled this. One of Professor Barrett's colleagues, Dr. Miguel Tovar Reaños, was before the Committee of Public Accounts to speak about that modelling some time ago. The ESRI's position is that carbon taxes, without any counter-poverty measures, are regressive. In the analysis that the institute has done, if carbon taxes were increased by €10 per tonne, what carbon emissions reductions would that bring and how quickly?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	294	I will not be able to remember the precise figure. It will be simpler to forward the Deputy the work in time. The institute has been analysing this issue for approximately 20 years. We have always tried to ask what imposing carbon taxes does for the demand for energy-intensive goods or production processes, and what the effect on emissions will be. The answer is typically that carbon taxes on their own will not typically solve the climate crisis, but they are an important component in this. I will hand over to Dr. Roantree in a moment because he has worked on this second matter. We have been aware for a long time that these taxes are regressive. The issue has always been how one designs the carbon tax such that the people who will lose are compensated in some shape or form.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	295	We will get to that in a second because it is a different question from the one I asked. The figure that we were given was 3.7%, if the carbon tax was increased from €20 to €30 per tonne. A 3.7% reduction in carbon emissions would be substantial. The State did not experience any reductions in carbon emissions over recent years. As far as I understand, the ESRI's study did not include agriculture or industry but was basically about household emissions. Perhaps Professor Barrett will help me to understand what behavioural changes people could make that will bring about such a dramatic reduction on carbon emissions based on the modelling the ESRI has done if there is an increase from €20 to €30 per tonne, and then much more than that. We know that the vast majority of working families still cannot afford electric vehicles. We know that many people cannot afford deep retrofitting and cannot depend on public transport. Perhaps Professor Barrett will be able to explain what measures people and households will take that will see such a dramatic reduction in carbon emissions by increasing carbon taxes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	296	Because I am not a direct author of the work, I might mischaracterise it, but let me draw the parallel. Carbon tax going from €20 to €30 per tonne is a 50% increase in the tax, which is substantial. One way the guys who do that work generate these results is by looking, for example, at petrol price changes over time. We have an experiment in the real world where the prices of energy are altered, partly petrol but also home heating oil and such, and we ask what the scale of the behavioural response is. My understanding is that those pretty large increases see reductions, whereby people might switch to public transport and may simply do less-----
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	297	I have one final question for Professor Barrett. I am struggling to understand this and I know this is a programme for Government issue that I do not want him to comment on. He said even a €10 increase would result in a 3.7% reduction in carbon emissions, which I do not see happening. If we increase the tax to €100 per tonne, which would be a dramatic increase over time, with €7.50 yearly increases, surely the State will take in less money from carbon tax.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	298	The Deputy is completely right in that the logic of carbon taxes is that, ideally, one would like to collect no revenue from them.

I know his organisation is going to do a review on fuel poverty, which I look forward to seeing in due course.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	304	I will try to confine myself to one question, if I can articulate it correctly. Earlier in the discussion, both sets of speakers had a conversation in regard to a stimulus or Keynesian type of approach to the situation we are in now. We know that we could be facing effectively a triple whammy in terms of the economic impact. The outworking of Covid-19, which Dr. Kinsella sets out very well in his paper, is dramatic in itself, but we also face the prospect of a no-deal or bad-deal Brexit. In addition to those two issues, Ireland could, as an open economy, be hit by other, international factors. The economy is particularly susceptible to downturns either in Britain or the United States. Those three issues will impact on the entire economy, but there will be particularly severe impacts on some regions, especially those regions that are dependent on specific sectors. My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is right on the Border, at the coalface of any outworkings in regard to Brexit, and is heavily dependent on the agrifood sector. In addition, the entire Border, midlands and western region is particularly and disproportionately dependent on the tourism sector. One can point to the regions that could take a dramatic impact as a result of the three factors to which I referred. The question I have is whether anybody can point to a type of stimulus package that would pinpoint those regions and ensure they are protected from some of the fallout. Does Dr. Kinsella or his colleagues have specific proposals that could inform the committee's work in this regard?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	305	There has been a lot of really good work done on the impact of Brexit on a county-by-county basis, which could form the basis of a Brexit and Covid response. I would start there. To go back to my comment to Deputy Nash, there is a need for serious sectoral studies to be done, particularly in tourism, transport and aviation, to understand what those impacts will be. Then we will be able design a stimulus and have regard to the balance sheet effects that matter. There will almost certainly be large-scale grants, perhaps with some conditionality attached to them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	306	To add to that, I remember that as the ESRI work on Brexit was coming through, there was a constant theme of regional disparity. Any time we looked at an average number for the effects of Brexit on the country, it was borderline meaningless because the distribution of those effects was so intense, especially in respect of the Border issues the Deputy raised. The difficulty is that we are well diagnosed in terms of the problem. Speaking for my profession, I often think that we economists are quite good at diagnosing problems but less good at surgical interventions that are going to make very significant differences and really help a situation. We agonise around things like dead weight, which we were discussing earlier, and how one gets relief or grants to an area whereby a certain proportion are not just going to result in dead weight. I often think that Deputies are asking the wrong people when they ask economists about this. People like those in Enterprise Ireland are much better in this regard because they have a much better understanding of SMEs at the ground level rather than at the data set level we carry with us.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	307	Let me follow on from Deputy Cullinane's points regarding carbon tax.We talked about the counties that will be disproportionately affected by the economic outworking of the three crises I mentioned. I imagine, and Dr. Roantree can correct me if I am wrong, that the same counties will be impacted by some of the proposals we heard in the past 24 hours, particularly the one on carbon tax. Would any of the witnesses give a view on whether it is sensible to impose a tax that disproportionately impacts on the regions that will be disproportionately impacted by Brexit, Covid-19 and international factors?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	308	I might come in on that. We put out a paper last year in our budget perspectives series which examined precisely the options we might consider if we want to compensate households for the rise in carbon tax. The main point we make on carbon taxes is that the overwhelming economic evidence is that they work. They change behaviour and lead to reductions in emissions. That is something that-----
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	309	If alternatives are in place.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	310	Yes. That has been the case and the experience in countries where carbon taxes have been increased. It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the carbon tax to rise to address climate change. I believe that is the way most economists would see it. The Deputy is right that the work we did showed that one of the groups that would pay most of a rise in the carbon tax would be people living in rural areas but commuting long distances. They were the group that would be particularly hit. We expected that electric cars would be the main way such people would respond to this. Now, however, it may be that working from home is a much more acceptable situation for most employers. In a way, Covid-19 might have brought about a solution that may not otherwise have been reached so quickly.  In terms of those who move out and those who cannot change their behaviour, if the concern is for the very poorest households, we pointed out that increasing social welfare rates at the same time as the carbon tax is increased can more than compensate most households. If between one third and one half of revenues that are raised by the increase in carbon tax are used to increase social welfare revenues, we will more than compensate the very lowest income households. There are real concerns about a carbon tax and its impacts on particular people or regions but those can be addressed and there are ways that have shown how to do that.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	311	It is important to reflect that the programme for Government does not have proposals for substantial increases in social welfare payments.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	312	I have two questions before I allow the real Chairman to contribute - I am only the Acting Chairman. On retail, the move towards online shopping in recent years has been evident, especially during the lockdown. We can all see the way An Post has reinvented itself with the number of packages it delivers. While that is great to see, there has been such a significant move towards online purchasing that footfall in the shops and shopping centres that have opened is down. People are worried about that. I am looking at it from the point of view of its effects as we move forward but also given that we seem to be moving towards a cashless society. Do the witnesses have any opinion on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	313	What is troubling about retail is that one has a sense that what might be happening is an acceleration of a process that was under way anyway. That seemed to be much more evident in the United Kingdom where one had the closure of the big retail outlets. It seemed that something was happening in terms of a changing pattern. That raises all sorts of concerns, especially for rural towns and villages. To be honest, this is a much bigger issue and it is quite a depressing one because when such a strong force is operating in a particular direction - this is more online shopping and the difficulties for towns, villages and even bigger urban centres - it is not entirely clear how economic measures or incentives can counteract what seems to be something that is much more fundamental. I do not have a cheerful answer to the question other than to say it was a pre-Covid issue.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	314	Is the move towards a cashless society accelerating because of Covid-19?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	315	The statistics from the Central Bank that have been published show that. They show that there has been a huge drop-off in people using cash and also the increased number of people using contactless payments. I have not touched my wallet in about three months. Everything is done on my phone now. As Professor Barrett said, Covid will accelerate trends that were already under way but it will accelerate them dramatically.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	316	There is an important social exclusion issue which is not really talked about. One of the joys of working in the ESRI is that one sees so many research reports coming across one's desk.We did a report a number of years ago on that. It was not so much about people who were cashless but about people who did not have bank accounts and the impact on them. It was a larger number than people would have realised. I have wondered on occasion since then how all those people who did not have bank accounts are managing at a logicistical level. 
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	317	A lot of the older generation use the post office and credit union in their own small town. They might not necessarily have access to banks which are predominantly in larger towns. How important does the witness see the role of apprenticeships going forward? In the previous Dáil, I was Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation which looked quite closely at apprenticeships. Last year, we had 15,000 apprentices in Ireland who have come on mightily in recent years. Unfortunately, only 2% of them were female. Dr. Roantree spoke earlier about youth unemployment in those aged between 18 and 24 currently standing at 51%. There is a great opportunity here for young people to earn as they learn, which is what we learned about last year, and to move towards apprenticeships. In the programme for Government, if it happens, we are talking about retrofitting half a million homes over the next five years. There could be a huge move for apprenticeships to retrofit. Does Professor Barrett see that as a key role?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	318	Possibly, and I am going to make one point. I am conscious that I am in your line of sight so I am getting to answer all the questions. I better be fair to my colleagues who are elsewhere.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	319	Yes, absolutely.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	320	When it comes to apprenticeships there are issues around infrastructure and those sorts of things, but the biggest issue is cultural. By that, I mean the notion of apprenticeships being some sort of second class citizen in our educational infrastructure, and the role of parents in saying to their kids that this is a good thing to do and not everybody has to go to Trinity College, UCD, University of Limerick or wherever else. That cultural point, in many ways, is as important as the nuts and bolts of basic provision.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	321	Thank you, Professor Barrett. Dr. Kinsella, would you like to comment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	322	I would agree with Professor Barrett. I spent a fair amount of my time on the board of the Higher Education Authority arguing for a deeper connection between further and higher education. We have apprenticeship models working in the University of Limerick and across most of the universities. It is early days to say whether they have been successful or not, but the more of these kind of throughputs we see, the better. Ireland has a low level of lifelong learning, for example, so it would be good to use those further to higher education, and indeed, higher to further education links. The stronger they are, the better we will be, especially in terms of things like the large retrofitting Deputy Butler rightly talked about.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	323	To conclude, Deputy McNamara has five minutes.

He stated the Department of Finance said that in 2009 GDP grew by 5.5%, this year it will fall by 10%, and next year it will grow by 6%; that is a V-shaped recession. He went on to say that the chances of that happening seemed low, but anybody that pretends to know is talking out of their hoop. Does Dr. Kinsella have any more information at this stage on which he might base predictions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	325	The most important thing, and perhaps less colloquially than I might have put it to the esteemed journalist at The Clare Champion, is that we exist in a high degree of uncertainty. That is why scenarios are developed instead of forecasts because, quite simply, the models will not work for the amount of uncertainty we have. When one sees a situation with this much uncertainty, it behoves the State to step in to try to reduce that level of uncertainty, which is why we are all talking about the activist fiscal policy. The other major point is if we have a situation where a V-shaped recession is looking unlikely, we must study the risk that it may be a longer-running recession. It may be U-shaped, and there may be sectors that are deeply damaged. Frankly speaking, we do not know, which is why in my written submission I argued that I hope for a strong research response to what exactly those risks are.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	326	To both the ESRI and Dr. Kinsella, what impact will bank lending practices have on what happens now regarding what type of recession we have, or whether we have one or not? Are the witnesses seeing any changes or trends in bank lending practices?Anecdotally, I am hearing many stories of loan offers being withdrawn. That is anecdotal, however, and I do not have anything concrete on the subject. Do any of the witnesses have any concrete information on that issue, and, even if not, what impact will there be on bank lending practices? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	327	We have not done any formal analysis of that issue in the institute but the Deputy's question brings me right back to the economic crisis of 2008 to 2010. Regarding bank practices then, it will be remembered that there was a thin flow of credit and a discussion of whether that resulted from the supply or demand side of the process. That eventually worked itself out. There is no doubt, however, and this is partly related to Government policy, that proactive lending by banks into the economy is going to be an important part of the overall recovery. Banks are businesses, though, and must show degrees of caution. That is clear, and again brings up the importance of State guarantees regarding these loans. It is a critical dimension. Ireland still seems to be a bit unusual in that SME enterprises are still very bank-oriented in their reliance on that sector for finance. Many other countries have changed that model. There was much effort in recent years to move our model away from being so bank-focused but we are not anywhere near far enough along that road to state anything other than banks are going to be critical.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	329	I think this issue will come down to turnover. A business is not going to take out a loan if it is not sure that it can service that loan. Similarly, a bank will have a concern about whether a firm that has demonstrated recent low turnover will be able to service a loan. The intermediary between the two is the State. The question concerns the appropriate design of those guarantees. Germany is a good example in this area but there have been many credit guarantees and credit injection programmes across the OECD, some very extensive. We could benefit from looking at those examples but with the proviso that firms do not know what September, October and November are going to bring regarding their turnover. Firms, therefore, are going to be very unlikely to want to take out loans, unless they are, in some sense, guaranteed by the State.

From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform I welcome Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Mr. Ronnie Downes, assistant secretary and Mr. John Kinnane, principal officer. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. We expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour but witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol. If witnesses have any concerns with how they are being treated I ask that they raise them. I ask Mr. McKeon to confine his opening remarks to five minutes as we cannot be here for longer than two hours. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	332	I thank the Chair and the committee members for the invitation to speak today. I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Ciarán Lawler and Ms Aideen Mooney. With the Chair's permission I may rely on them in responding to questions. In a normal year, we typically receive 200,000 jobseeker claims. In a normal month we receive about 100,000 claims across all of our schemes. In response to the Covid-19 crisis the staff of the Department has processed more than 1.2 million claims from more than 730,000 people thus far. Solely in the five-week period from 13 March, the staff dealt with and quickly got into payment more than four years' worth of claims under a new scheme, the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, which was itself designed, developed and implemented in a matter of days. We also introduced a new illness benefit payment, worked with Revenue to develop the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme and revised processes for community welfare services. We set up and staffed new call centres to respond to millions of queries and deployed new online service systems. Visits to our website, use of our online services and calls to our call centres exceeded those to all other organisations. On average we received an online application once every 40 seconds. To facilitate all of this, staff worked on emergency legislation to enable us to provide payments, modify redundancy arrangements and operate the civil registration service. None of this could have been achieved unless staff members continued to come to work at a time when public health advice was to stay at home. I thank them for their commitment. Their demonstration of real public service values has been exemplary.It was not just our staff. I also acknowledge and thank the 350 staff of other Departments who came to work with us and our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners, who took on the development and administration of the wage subsidy scheme.  There is now no doubt that the measures taken to flatten the peak and reduce the impact of the pandemic on demand for health services had the effect of transferring that peak into the labour market and that demand onto the Department’s jobseeker supports. On Friday, 13 March, more than 20,000 people arrived at our Intreo centres to submit jobseeker claims. As it was clear that we could not cope with that level of demand, over that weekend we developed and commenced implementation of what would become the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. We initially introduced the payment at the standard jobseeker rate of €203 per week, with the intention of quickly revising the payments to claimants with adult or child dependants to put them on the appropriate higher rate soon thereafter. However, it soon became apparent that even this would not be feasible and we were concerned that people in multi-person households would be disadvantaged by having to depend for some time on the payment rate for a single adult. We also were concerned that even with a simplified process, we might not be able to clear all claims if, as seemed likely, further restrictions would be imposed. We also wanted to do what we could to avoid breaking the link between employers and workers. We therefore modified our approach by formally establishing the PUP as a flat-rate payment of €350 and introducing what ultimately became the temporary wage subsidy scheme. The higher rate of €350 per week was set to match the standard jobseeker rate for a two-person household. In addition, it was aligned with the average salary level in the two most affected sectors, retail and hospitality, thereby mitigating the loss of employment income for many people.  Since the introduction of those payments, a number of changes have been made or are planned. The subsidy payable under the wage subsidy scheme has been increased from 70% to 85% in respect of low-paid employees and the scheme was extended to cover people who were on maternity or illness related leave prior to Covid-19. In the case of the PUP, the payment rate is to be more closely linked to prior income. The €350 flat rate resulted in people who had previously only worked a few hours per week receiving payments in excess of their prior income and in excess of what they would normally expect as a jobseeker payment. This has obvious consequences in terms of costs to the State. Arguably, it also undermines the integrity of the social protection system as an equitable and effective method of income distribution. We know, for example, that many part-time workers are second earners, including student workers, in higher income households. Therefore, the Government decided that people whose earnings were less than €200 per week will move to the standard jobseeker rate of €203 per week from the end of this month.  The Department has also implemented other measures in response to Covid-19. It introduced the special Covid-19 illness benefit payment from which more than 51,000 people have benefitted. The waiting days period for this illness benefit and for jobseeker payments were waived. Recognising that people cocooning at home would incur additional heating costs, the fuel allowance season was extended by four weeks. We also made changes to the rent supplement process and an additional 5,700 people have been benefiting from rent supplement support since the start of March 2020.  The Government has announced that the measures taken to date, originally intended to last for 12 weeks, will be extended to August. How they change and develop over coming months will depend on progress in suppressing the virus and restoring business activity. It will also depend on the ability of the State to finance the extraordinarily high levels of expenditure being incurred. The Department is likely to exceed its original budget by some €10 billion. This increase alone is greater than the full Estimate for all Departments with the exception of education and health. At a likely outturn of €30 billion, the Department will this year spend over €15,000 for each worker or, put another way, for every €1 that is forecast to be raised in income tax this year, we will spend about €1.60 on social welfare. This is the context for future decisions.  There are, however, encouraging signs. It is encouraging to see the rate of new cases of Covid-19 fall and to see shutters raise and business reopen. It is also encouraging that from a peak of over 600,000 payments at cost of over €210 million per week, this week we will make fewer than 500,000 payments under PUP at a cost of about €175 million. The Department’s focus is now turning towards helping people whose employment does not recover. We are therefore working with colleagues in other Departments to start the process of planning for the ramping up of employment services, training and other supports to people who may not get back to work in the short to medium term. We know from relatively recent experience that measures to support people to retain contact with the labour market and acquire relevant skills are critically important to preventing unemployment becoming entrenched.

I apologise, we are going to hear first from Mr. Watt and then committee members will ask questions. I apologise; it has been a long day. I thank Mr. Watt for coming in.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	336	I thank the Chairman. I will start with a brief statement The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our society and economy. To respond to this crisis, the Government has agreed over the past few months a series of expenditure measures to support our health service in expanding its capacity, to provide income support to workers who have lost their jobs over this period, and to support firms to maintain employment and the vital link with their employees through the wage subsidy scheme. The evolving nature of the public health situation has required that Government act quickly to address the challenges facing our citizens. From an economic perspective the labour market has borne the brunt of the impact. In the early part of the year, we were in a position of almost full employment. At the end of May, the Covid-19 adjusted monthly unemployment measure produced by the CSO showed the unemployment rate at 26%. In these circumstances, the Government has taken significant steps to cushion, where possible, the impact on households and firms. These supports seek to minimise the potential long-term effects of the crisis on our economy. By supporting the connection between workers and employers and providing targeted supports to business, the objective of policy has been to facilitate business restarts as public health restrictions are eased. The SPU, published in April of this year, outlined projected overall gross voted expenditure of €78.4 billion for 2020, including an additional €8 billion across a variety of areas. Taking into account the social protection Estimate agreed by Dáil Éireann last month, and Government decisions since the SPU was published, in particular the extension of the PUP and the TWSS, the additional expenditure, relative to last December’s Revised Estimates is now estimated at approximately €11.5 billion, which is that amount higher than that forecast last December. These projected increases are subject to considerable uncertainty given the evolving employment situation as businesses restart. These additional expenditures will bring gross voted expenditure for 2020 to €82 billion, an increase of more than 20% relative to last year, which is probably the largest increase in nominal spending that we have ever had. The forecasts in the stability programme outlined a general government deficit of €23 billion or almost 7.5% of GDP for this year. This reflects the expenditure measures introduced as well as the effects of the automatic stabilisers as revenues fall and unemployment spending increases. However, there is a high level of uncertainty as to the outcome for this year. A delayed recovery in the economy, for example, could result in a deficit of up to €30 billion this year. The State will borrow to cover this deficit this year and for as long as is required. We can afford to borrow cheaply on this scale in support of our economy and our people because of the actions of the ECB and the credibility of our approach to the public finances. In response to this crisis, the Government moved swiftly to introduce a range of measures. During this period, the normal procedures for advance sanctioning of expenditure by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform via the Department remained in place. Under these arrangements, sanction requests for funding to support rapid actions were analysed, assessed and responded to in an efficient and streamlined manner to expedite necessary expenditures agreed by Government. Specific streamlined arrangements were put in place between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health, and involved regular reporting on Covid-19-related health expenditure. This is important as clear, rapid, targeted and properly resourced public health measures have been, and remain, a crucial element of the response to this pandemic. To date, more than €1.8 billion in additional funding has been agreed by the Government for the Department of Health. This funding has supported the scaling up of acute and community services, including expanding physical capacity and the purchase of equipment such as ventilators and PPE. This funding is also being used to provide support to private and public nursing homes, and secured 100% of private hospital capacity during the peak of the crisis. Outside of the health area, economic measures included the wage subsidy scheme and the PUP, various liquidity measures, direct grants for impacted small and microenterprises though the restart grant scheme and the trading online voucher scheme, deferral and warehousing of tax liabilities for a 12-month period through the Revenue Commissioners, and a targeted commercial rates waiver for a three-month period through the local authorities. The Government has indicated that further supports will be required for small businesses to aid the economic recovery. As the Revised Estimates for 2020, which set out the allocations for the year, were not voted on prior to the dissolution of the previous Dáil, Departments are currently operating under the ‘four-fifths’ rule that applies under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965. As we are pressed for time, I will skip ahead and make a few final comments. On fiscal sustainability, underpinning the strategy to be adopted in the recovery phase, the management of voted expenditure needs to continue to be conducted in a manner that meets the Government’s targets for fiscal sustainability and continued improvement in public service outcomes. The State is well placed to borrow to fund the deficit arising from the crisis. This is against a backdrop of currently favourable financing conditions and the backstopping role of the ECB.The cost of borrowing money is cheap but this must be seen in the context of an expanding volume of public debt. With gross public debt projected to head toward €250 billion, an average interest rate of less than 2%, which is the current position, generates an annual debt generate interest bill in the range of €4 to €5 billion. An average rate of 3% could see that annual bill go to €7.5 billion, while an average rate of 4% could generate a bill of €10 billion. It needs to be considered, therefore, that over the medium to long term - not this year or next year - Ireland will issue and refinance this debt against a less favourable background. As we move into the recovery phase, in the future a robust fiscal anchor will be required to ensure sustainable growth in Exchequer spending. The substantial emergency measures introduced in the early stages of this crisis have had a significant expenditure impact. They played a crucial role in supporting households and enterprises and the scale and magnitude of these supports was essential. As we move forward, that context is changing for reopening the economy. Now our focus needs to be on supporting the economy to transition out of the crisis phase and into recovery. This means prioritising measures that will stimulate activity and employment. This will not be an easy task, as the broader context in which these decisions must be made remains challenging. In addition to the significant uncertainty that exists around the medium to long-term impacts of the virus, the uncertainty that is now present in the global economy presents a particular challenge given the openness of our economy. These challenges highlight the importance of maintaining fiscal accountability and of framing our policies within the broader fiscal considerations. At the beginning of this year, the public finances were in a strong position. In considering our expenditure strategy for the future, our aim must be to move back towards that position over time as the economy recovers.

I welcome the witnesses. I will begin by acknowledging, as Mr. McKeon referenced, the put-through of 1.2 million claims from 730,000 people over a short timeframe. That was phenomenal put-through. I want to acknowledge the outstanding work of those in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, especially those in the local offices. I am very conscious that many of the staff were coming in at 6 a.m. to deal with ever-changing demands, changes in payments and everything else, making themselves accessible and very much being on the front line. They are not always recognised as being on the front line but I recognise it, and I would like to acknowledge that sterling service. I would like to ask Mr. McKeon a very specific question about the PUP and arrears associated with that. There are many cases of arrears. I want to know what accommodation is being made going forward to ensure that payment is made.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	339	I thank the Deputy. The Department will pay back any arrears that are due to be paid. We hope to do so as quickly as possible. However, the issue of arrears may not be as large as people think. To give a practical example, most people were laid off on a Monday and they did not receive a payment that week but they received a payment the following week and, as a consequence, believe they have missed a week. In practice we pay the payment one week in arrears and what is happening now as people go back to work is that they are finding they are receiving a payment in the first week they are back in work, so the issue of arrears is probably just a little exaggerated. The processing of arrears will happen over the next number of months. We have to review all 730,000 people who applied, including the 688,000 people who received the payment. We will have to review all of those claims on an individual basis. We are in the process of writing an IT programme to try to automate that as quickly as we can. At this point we still have a huge volume of work processing the nearly 500,000 payments that we are making every week, managing moves from the PUP onto the wage subsidy scheme and back, and so on. We have to prioritise getting the payments that are in place out and make sure that happens. It will take some time but we anticipate that we will start making payments of arrears in quarter 3.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	340	I appreciate that. I have just realised that I have six minutes. I have a very specific question, one that I have raised at every session today. It concerns a sector of workers that I feel have been lost in the pandemic, namely seasonal workers.I must raise their case. I am from a tourism county - Kerry - where there is a huge number of seasonal workers who have lost out with the pandemic unemployment payment. We have little knowledge of how their industry will improve in coming months. Seasonal workers traditionally work in summer so they have their stamps for winter but their stamps are running out. What measures can be taken to support seasonal workers? That question is for Mr. Watt or Mr. McKeon.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	341	The issue of seasonal workers has been raised with us. The eligibility conditions for the pandemic payment, like the normal jobseeker's payment, is that a person was in employment immediately prior to claiming the payment. It is very difficult. While I appreciate the issue, the Deputy will understand the difficulty we would face in trying to distinguish or identify potential but unrealised employment and separating genuine cases from others that might not have happened.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	342	Sorry to interrupt, but would it not be acceptable in the case of seasonal workers who would be in a position to show that they have a history of seasonal work and could prove it from previous years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	343	There would be people who work seasonally one year but not the following year and so on. There is another factor which is germane to this. We had full employment prior to this. People who were claiming jobseeker's payments in January, February and early March continue to have access to those payments. They claim those payments on the basis that they could not get employment during January, February and March, yet we know the economy was at full employment and we had thousands of vacancies. It creates a difficulty if those people say that they could not get a job back then when we know there was quite a lot of employment around. We must be careful. It is something that would be possible to change but that would require a change in the law and how we operate jobseeker's payments.
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	344	I thank Mr. McKeon. I am sorry, but I only have another minute. This is something that should be examined by the tourism task force. It is a forgotten sector. I wish to raise the case of two other groups, namely, those over 66 years and students who would traditionally have worked over the summer to help themselves through college. They are not in a position to do that as the jobs are not there. They are not eligible for any payments.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	345	Is the Deputy taking additional time?
#NormaFoley	unknown-#NormaFoley-party	unknown-#NormaFoley-dob	unknown-#NormaFoley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	346	I am taking six minutes. Is there scope to do something specifically for students and those over 66 years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	347	Generally, students do not qualify for jobseeker's payment during the summer period between school or college years. The pandemic unemployment payment is effectively the jobseeker's payment and the same conditions apply. Therefore they are not eligible. If there are real issues for students, I am not sure the pandemic unemployment payment is the mechanism through which they should be addressed. I acknowledge there are people who might have had an anticipation of employment and of saving during that period and who may not now get access to that employment, which might create difficulty, but I am not sure that making an unemployment payment is the best method by which to address that. We are still struggling to fill jobs in some sectors, including horticulture, care and some areas of retail, so there is work available. I do not want to overstate it but that should be borne in mind. The other issue is that many students have been in receipt of the pandemic payment in recent months. They are issues that need to go into the mix and which the Government must take into account when considering these issues. As I noted in my opening statement, the pandemic unemployment payment was a quick, rapid-fire way of getting a jobseeker's payment in place. The standard rule of jobseeker's payments is they apply to those between 18 and 66 years. The State income support paid to those over 66 years is the State pension. That is still available. Those are the rules of the game. A change to that would be a fairly fundamental change to how the social welfare system is constructed and would require legislation.

At one of our previous hearings, there was some discussion on the deal that was struck between the State and private hospitals. We know that the negotiators from the State side were the Department of Health and the HSE. As we will have further sessions on this issue in the coming weeks, I seek clarity on whether the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had any role in the process. Was the Department required or asked to sign off on the contract that was eventually agreed and did the Department have any input at all into that particular arrangement? Perhaps Mr. Watt could provide clarity for us on that issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	349	We were not involved in the negotiations. As Deputy Cullinane said, those matters were dealt with by the Department of Health and the HSE. We discussed the matter in advance with the Department of Health and, ultimately, we gave sanction for the decision to go ahead with that. While we were not involved in the actual negotiations we were aware of the discussions taking place. Sanction was provided for the funding to enter into that deal.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	350	I thank Mr. Watt very much for that. I wish to put a number of questions to Mr. McKeon. The first question relates to unsecured household debt and whether the Department has done any recent analysis or research on the level of unsecured household debt in the State.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	351	No, we have not done any research in recent times, certainly not since the Covid crisis, on the level of unsecured household debt. As Deputy Cullinane is aware, the Citizens Information Board and the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, are agencies of the Department and that is a matter they would typically examine. I can tell the Deputy what he probably already knows in terms of what is in the public discourse, which is that the overall level of household debt is reducing and the overall level of savings is increasing. Of course, I always give a caveat to those answers because while that might be true at an aggregate level, for the people in respect of whom it is not true, that aggregate does not give them any comfort. I often make the point that even if unemployment is just at 4% or 5%, the people who are unemployed are 100% unemployed and I guess the same thing applies in the context of household debt. So overall-----
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	352	When was the last time anyone in the Department at Mr. McKeon's level, or senior level close to his, had discussions with the Citizens Information Board or the head of that board on household debt?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	353	I cannot say. A member of the management board of the Department is a board member of the Citizens Information Board, so it would be discussed at that level. I am not a member of the board myself so I cannot say when that-----
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	354	In terms of policy responses, obviously the Department would have a role, so it might surprise Mr. McKeon to learn that I did have a meeting with the head of the board recently and she indicated that in her view, we are heading towards a tsunami of household debt, especially for low-income households, as a consequence of Covid because of the holiday on rents, mortgages and possibly unpaid utility bills. There is a real concern that some of those families will be vulnerable and might end up having to go to moneylenders and all of the issues that arise from not dealing with household debt. Would it not be appropriate for the Department to look at these policy responses? I know there has been some commentary as well about the State, possibly through MABS, having public personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, to deal with people who have unsecured household debt, especially for low income families. If it is a concern for the Citizens Information Board that we could be looking at a tsunami of debt in September, would it not be prudent for the Department to look now at what policy responses might need to be put in place to deal with that tsunami if it does come?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	355	Absolutely. If the chair of the Citizens Information Board comes to the Department, we will certainly engage with her on that. A number of policy responses are already in place. We fund the personal insolvency practitioners and we provide rent supplement and other supports, so there are payments and supports available. If they need to be enhanced, developed or expanded or if more resources need to be put into it, that is certainly something we would consider on the advice or recommendation of the Citizens Information Board.

On the living wage, does the Low Pay Commission come under the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	357	The Low Pay Commission is a body under the Department, yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	359	The Department, as the Deputy may be aware, funds the work of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice on the minimum essential standard of living. This work informs the living wage. That is how we do that work. We fund the partnership and rely on its figures and analysis. We are very pleased to fund that work and believe it is a high quality piece of work.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	360	We can see in the public domain what might be coming down the road with regard to the living wage. How quickly we get there will be an issue. It is very important, as a starting point, that the Department has a clear understanding of what the rate will be. Is Mr. McKeon saying that the Department has not done work on that yet? All of the Government responses have been to increase the minimum wage. That is the issue considered by the Low Pay Commission which does not look at the living wage. The living wage technical group, which is part of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, sets what it considers to be the living wage rate. At the moment, it is €12.30 per hour. Is that the figure the Department will work from?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	361	We would certainly work with its analysis. One must be careful about taking a very simplistic analysis, and I do not suggest that the Deputy has done so. If one looks at the work of the Vincentian Partnership, it has produced more than six figures - I think it may be in the region of nine or ten different figures - based on household types, localities and so on. Another issue that is often overlooked in discussions on the living wage and the minimum wage is that many people on the minimum wage are second earners in high income households. Analysis by the ESRI and others shows that increasing the minimum wage has a negligible impact on the incomes of lower income households and the reduction of poverty and actually has a stronger and higher impact on better-off households. I would be careful, therefore, about how we interpret the data.

I asked what the view of the Department would be. Mr. McKeon stated that we must be careful because different rates might be needed to take on board different circumstances for individuals, where people live and so on. That is fine. I am trying to understand what the perspective of the Department would be, in the event that the State commits to moving to a living wage, on what architecture it will use, what the potential rate will be and whether there will be multiple rates because, as Mr. McKeon put it, the matter is complex. I accept that. I was only looking for the information. In order to gain a better understanding, has the Department considered changing the composition and terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission to have it look at the living wage?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	363	As the Deputy will be aware, the terms of reference for the Low Pay Commission are set out in legislation. We have not looked at changing those terms of reference. I am aware of the public discourse around the putative programme for Government and the commitment in that to a living wage. Certainly, that is something we would have to look at if that programme for Government is brought to fruition. We will look at it at that time.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	364	Does Mr. McKeon accept that there is a clear distinction between increasing the minimum wage and moving towards a living wage?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	365	There is a distinction between the two. If one increases the minimum wage, by definition one is moving towards the living wage. An increase in one will bring one closer to the other.

I understand that JobPath was extended until the end of the year and there is an option to extend it further. Is there a plan to extend JobPath beyond the end of the year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	367	No. At this stage, the referrals to JobPath will stop at the end of this year. No decision has been made with respect to any extension or otherwise of JobPath-----

Mr. McKeon said no decision was made. Is it definitive that there will not be an extension or is there a possibility that a decision will be made to extend JobPath further?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	369	The Deputy is asking me to speculate on what a new Government and new Minister might decide. I cannot do that. It is certainly an issue that will be on the table.

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	371	I thank both Mr. McKeon and Mr. Watt for the work that they have done at this difficult time, as well as all the staff in the Departments and all the offices around the country. It has been a challenging time for everybody. There has been a huge input made in time and commitment and dedication to the job and that needs to be acknowledged. Mr. McKeon was giving us figures on the number of people who have benefited under the Covid payment. Is there any idea at this stage of the number who will end up in long-term employment for a period of time greater than six months from the end of April last? I wonder whether we have an idea of the kind of numbers we will be talking about. For instance, today I received a few calls from people where small businesses are not reopening because of new regulations coming in or in trying to comply with Covid requirements, it is not physically possible for them to reopen. Have we an idea as to the numbers of people we will see in six months' time who will not be back in employment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	372	The figures we are working on at present are those that were published in the stability programme update. The stability programme update is forecasting an unemployment rate at the end of the year of just under 10%. If memory serves me correctly, there is an average for the year of approximately 14%. At 10% unemployment at the end of the year, one will be looking at a figure of approximately 400,000.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	373	In respect of that figure of 400,000 and on the basis of the high numbers of young people affected at present, what is the prediction on the number who will be under 25?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	374	At present, I envisage that the number of those under 25 probably will be the first to reduce, and will reduce most dramatically. Generally speaking, in any period of unemployment young people tend to be the first who are impacted but also in many ways the first to recover. We anticipate that to repeat. I cannot put a precise number on it but I know, for example, that the current cohort of people who are on pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, includes a fair number of students whose colleges closed in March. As the education sector reopens, one will find that many of those will go back into education and I expect the number to reduce.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	375	Obviously, some of those will not be going back into education because they have finished their education, either at second level or third level. Have plans been put in place by the Department as regards new initiatives to help young people who are running into difficulties in trying to find employment through apprenticeships or further education? Has the Department looked at that area as of now?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	376	Yes. We started a programme of work on that with our colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills. It is likely - these will be decisions for an incoming Government - that one will see an increased emphasis in the next number of months on programmes that will help people, not only young people but all people, to reconnect with the labour market directly through employment and work placements, through specific skills training programmes or through back-to-education allowance schemes. There is a suite of measures which are standard in any public employment response and we certainly will be looking to ramp those up.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	377	For instance, when we had very high unemployment previously, we set up a scheme whereby people had a direct link to someone every month to try to assist them in finding employment. Do we now need to increase the number of people who will be able to give assistance?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	378	We more than likely will. At present, we have approximately 150 people in the local employment services, 300 people in our own Department and approximately 600 people in JobPath service providers who are currently supporting unemployed people and providing that monthly meeting to which the Deputy refers. That is at a ratio of 200 jobseekers to each case officer.With the likely increase in the unemployment figures, that ratio will increase to 400:1. It is probably not sustainable to offer a service at that level. It is therefore likely that we will increase resources through the Department, the local employment services or another mechanism. We will have to have a look at how quickly the labour market responds first. One of the tricks is not to respond with overprovision in anticipation of the worst only to find that the labour market responds more quickly than expected. The next few weeks will be telling.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	379	I will go back to the Department of Finance with regard to the recovery of revenue. I have received many complaints from people who import vehicles. They are finding it difficult to get vehicle registration tax, VRT, clearance. This is particularly the case in Cork. As a result of the backlog, it appears that there is quite a long delay in getting assessments for VRT. This is income for the State at a time when it is needed. Has there been any decision taken to increase the amount of such work done by the various units around the country? Will that area be examined in view of the fact that such an action would physically bring in money?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	380	That area is not within my remit. I believe it is within the remit of the Revenue Commissioners. I will certainly bring the Deputy's query to Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the board of the Revenue Commissioners. I will make him aware of the Deputy's query and perhaps he can respond directly.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	381	The area of bringing in finance that should be paid to the State is important. Is now not the time to ensure that we dot the i's and cross the t's to make sure that there is sufficient money coming in where it is available and where it should be coming in? One such area relates to VRT. My understanding is that there is quite a substantial delay and that the State, therefore, is at a loss as a result of the finance not being available.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	382	I certainly understand what the Deputy is saying. In principal, it is absolutely correct. As I have said, I am not in a position to comment on the resourcing of the vehicle registration tax service but I will bring the issue back to my colleagues.
#DuncanSmith	unknown-#DuncanSmith-party	unknown-#DuncanSmith-dob	unknown-#DuncanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	383	I have a question for Mr. McKeon. Has any further consideration been given to those over 66 who are on pensions but who have been working out of a need to meet mortgage requirements or because of family splits which have had a financial impact upon them? These people are denied the PUP. This is a real anomaly which has affected many people. I am interested in whether there has been any further discussion within the Department on revisiting this big gap with regard to the provision of this payment. I also want to acknowledge the work of the Department and its officials throughout the country over recent months. It is hard to comprehend just how much work its staff have done and the Herculean efforts they have undertaken. I should have put that on the record at the start. If the Department is to maintain the level of supports and administration outlined in its opening statement, will it have to increase its level of staffing to function at the higher level it has reached in handling the pandemic payment? Will a new recruitment scheme for the Department be needed? Has the Department encountered many problems with people's inability to acquire public services cards or to attend offices because of public health guidelines and restrictions during this period? What kind of impact has that had?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	384	I thank the Deputy. He may have seen me smile when he asked the question about staffing while I was in the same room as the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. He has given me an ideal opportunity, although I will not take it up.On the issue of staffing in the Department, we had a Herculean effort to respond to a tsunami of claims. Hopefully we will not have to go through that again and things should settle down to a level that is manageable within the existing staff resource. One of the things we have done during this period is accelerate the roll-out of online systems, which has been extremely helpful and which will probably help us to sustain service at the correct levels in the immediate future. We may have to look at the allocation of staff between different types of functions, for example between employment services and claim processing. We may look to do some rebalancing there. Without selling the pass, and I may well come back to my colleague, the Secretary General, Mr. Watt, at this point I am comfortable that we are okay with the staffing we have got. With regard to the over-66s, to repeat a point I made earlier, the pandemic unemployment payment is beginning to take on almost a mythical status as being possibly the solution to every type of revenue and income deficit and being capable of covering every type of cost that might be incurred. The pandemic unemployment payment is a jobseeker payment. It was a fast way of delivering jobseeker payments at a time when the Department could not possibly put everybody through the rigours of a full jobseeker assessment. It mirrors the jobseeker conditionality which applies, namely, over 18, under 66 and resident in the State. Right now there is no intention to change that, although it would be a matter for Government and the Oireachtas ultimately. The provisions the Oireachtas has made for people who are over 66 is to give them a payment which is conditional primarily on age. Everybody over 66 resident in the State is eligible for that payment. That is the income support payment. There are no barriers to getting it in terms of the kind of scale we had on the jobseeker payments. Someone who is over 66 does not face difficulties in getting access to the pension payment. If their income conditions change and they need to have the payment re-rated there are no difficulties in getting access to that. It is also important to bear in mind that we set the jobseeker pandemic unemployment payment at the rate for a two-person household because we did not believe it was fair to disadvantage multi-person households by only paying the single person rate. The two-person household rate for the pension payment is still significantly more than the two-person rate for the Covid payment. They are not actually disadvantaged. Another thing is that we have a safety net to the safety net, which is the supplementary welfare allowance system. We have been very public in saying to people who are over 66 that if they are in financial difficulties, they should come and talk to us. Thus far, 137 people over 66 have come in, even though we publicised that service. A final point is that people over 66 have access to the temporary wage subsidy scheme because that is a payment to the employer, not to the individual. I think the Government has determined there is sufficient provision at this point. Obviously, were that to change, we would require legislation, which is a difficulty at this point in time. With regard to the public services card, we postponed registrations for social distancing reasons and because we needed to divert staff onto claim processing for the pandemic unemployment payment. We have recently restarted that process. We trialled a number of public services card registrations over the past weeks using a new socially distant method. With the support of the union and staff representatives we are currently talking to, that is something we hope to expand in the coming days.
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	385	I extend our enormous thanks to the staff in Mr. McKeon's Department. Their Herculean efforts certainly ensured that the suffering of many people during the time of crisis was alleviated somewhat. On the statement Mr. McKeon provided to members, I take umbrage at one of the remarks in it. It has been much discussed that some people who happened to be earning less than €350 ended up earning €350 during the time of the pandemic payment. I refer in particular to Mr. McKeon's comments that arguably, this undermines the integrity of the social protection system as an equitable and effective method of income distribution. I disagree entirely with that. The Secretary General went on to state that the Government therefore decided that people whose earnings were less than €200 per week would have their payment reduced to €203. A number of sectors were excluded from this payment and the people concerned believe they have been treated unfairly as a consequence of some of the decisions made.I refer in particular to students, especially those who worked one or two days a week in February or March and then had their income reduced, despite the fact that now, in June, they would have been paid €400 or €500 per week working full time. It is not unfair that they were being paid €350, which is not a miraculous sum. They are being unfairly targeted by this measure. What is Mr. McKeon's view on that? As a remedy for the unfairness, the eligibility for the PUP should become a qualifying criterion for the back to education allowance in September. It would add a modicum of fairness to the process if that could be done.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	386	I ask that the Deputy ensures I answer all the questions because I have not managed to write them all down. With regard to the issue of the number of people who were earning less than €350 per week and then started getting €350 on the PUP, as I stated earlier we endeavoured to set the rate of the payment at €350 for two main reasons, the first of which was to provide an income support in respect of multi-person, and particularly two-person, households and not disadvantage them. That was the main factor in coming to that decision. The other factor was to set it at the average earnings rate for people in the two most affected sectors, namely, hospitality and retail. In the event, approximately 50% of people who got the payment earned more than €350 a week and 50% earned less, a distribution one would expect when an average rate such as that is set. On the issue of people who earned significantly less than €350 prior to becoming unemployed and whether that undermines the credibility and integrity of the social welfare system, I used the word "arguable". It is a subjective question of opinion as to whether it undermines it but I stated that because the point has been raised and a number of people - more than 10% of the recipients of the payment - had been earning less than €100 a week and were now on €350. That has been raised as an issue of equity and fairness. The question is why somebody who was previously working only one or two days or evenings a week is getting a payment of €350 a week when somebody who was working a full week receives the same sum-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	388	I will come to the student issue now. They are questions that had to be dealt with and decisions had to be taken. The Government took a view and made the decision. It is important to point out that students will still get €203 a week for the period between college years when, normally, students do not get any payment. While it may appear to be a disadvantage to them that the payment is being reduced, they are still at an advantage compared with where they would have been, for example, during the previous recessions, when they would not have received any payment. That may be cold comfort and it may not be perfect but, as I said earlier-----
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	389	Mr. McKeon might address the question on the qualifying payment for the back to education allowance.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	390	That is what I am coming to. Issues will arise for people because of the financial impact of the crisis and the PUP should not be the mechanism through which they are resolved. If there are issues with funding courses and so on in the future, other mechanisms will potentially be available. It has been determined that the period for which someone has received the payment will act to qualify him or her for the back to education allowance.
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	391	That is welcome.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	392	I will ask Mr. McKeon some questions about the cut to the PUP. I am trying to get clarity about facts. I asked some of the following questions of the Taoiseach last week and did not get an answer. As a case study, Emma was working two days a week for eight hours and has one child. She was earning €192 a week pre-Covid-19, which was less than the €203 payment, and she was getting €222.50 per week in jobseeker's transitional payment. Her employment earnings were less than €200 but she was getting a jobseeker's transitional payment that brought her up to €417.50. Her payment was then cut to €350 with the introduction of the PUP when she lost her job due to the pandemic.Will her pandemic unemployment payment be cut to €203, meaning she will be, therefore, forced to go back on to the jobseeker's transitional payment in order to go up to €239? In such a case, one is talking about someone going from €417.50 a week to €239 a week.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	393	The Deputy has asked me a detailed question but I do not have the precise answer. I will come back to the Deputy with a written answer on that. What we have done generally for people who are in receipt of employment income on most of our schemes, for example, disability allowance, carer's payment, working family payment, one-parent family payment, is that we have not adjusted their payment. We have basically allowed the pandemic unemployment payment of €350 to substitute for their employment income. Accordingly, in the case of someone like Emma, who was previously on less than €200 euro a week, she will still be better off even on the reduction than she would have been prior to that. I will need to check the Deputy's particular question around the jobseeker transition scheme to see if that is one of the schemes which is covered. I will come back to the Deputy directly on that.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	394	In the press statement from the Department, it was explicit that for those whose prior employment earnings were up to €199.99 per week, the pandemic unemployment payment rate will be €203 per week. Employment earnings is not there by accident. It is quite explicit. It is the case that those who were on less than €200 a week in terms of employment earnings are going to have their pandemic unemployment payment cut, regardless of how much they were actually taking in and reliant on in a weekly basis in terms of other social welfare payments and so on.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	395	While the pandemic unemployment payment will be cut, it will be no less and, in most cases, it will be more than they earned through employment. If they had another social welfare payment, in general the position has been that such a social welfare payment continued unchanged. It will continue unchanged. The Deputy asked me a specific question around the jobseeker transition scheme. I just do not have that information with me but I will check whether that is one of those payments.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	396	I will take a more common case of a person on jobseeker's allowance. For example, someone is working two days a week on a minimum wage, getting just over €160 week and getting three days of jobseeker's allowance, bringing in a total income €290 a week. However, their employment income is less than €200. As I understand it - Mr. McKeon can correct me if I am wrong - that person is not entitled to claim for the three days of jobseeker's allowance when they are on the €350 pandemic unemployment payment. Is that the case?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	397	That is the case.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	399	No.

Now that will be reduced to €203.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	401	They will be reduced to what their employment income was.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	402	If it is based on the employment income, that they are going to be cut and not entitled to jobseeker's allowance on top of it, then they are going to be worse off.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	403	No. I need to just check the issue with the jobseeker transition payment.

I just want to confirm that is the case with the jobseeker transition scheme. It should be.

Turning first to Mr. Watt, some of the figures with regard to the level of damage done to the economy are incredible. It is estimated that there will be a €30 billion deficit this year. Unemployment levels are around 26% currently. What levels of modelling and forecasting has the Department done with regards to unemployment, deficit and growth for the next three to five years? Maybe Mr. Watt could address that first.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	407	Macroeconomic forecasts accounting for GDP, GNI*, the labour market and what happens to the fiscal deficit are prepared by the Department of Finance. The latest numbers, which we have already discussed, would suggest the overall income of the economy will fall by upwards of 10% and that the deficit will be 7.5% of GDP, which is €23 billion. It could be more than that given the uncertainty over how quickly the economy will recover. The Department of Finance produces these numbers, and they have been set out. Everybody accepts and knows, however, that there is an unusual amount of uncertainty now over trying to project where the economy will be. There are just too many variables and unknowns at this stage. The numbers are the latest from the Department of Finance and the Department will prepare updated forecasts, not during the summer, as used to be the case, but with the budget in October.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	409	There will be a significant deficit this year and next year. What happens in 2022 really depends on how the economy evolves and decisions the Government will take on spending and income tax. It really depends on how quickly the economy will recover and how quickly people will get back to work. Most of the deficit is of a temporary, cyclical nature. There will be a more structural and more permanent element to the deficit but we just do not know the figure.

For example, there are people talking about a 100% return to school in the latter half of the year while some are talking about a much lower percentage. The latter would mean a significant number would still remain outside the labour force. Have any of these variables been included in the projections?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	411	As I said, the projections are prepared by the Department of Finance. It would consider the hit to employment. We are aware of the significant reduction in employment based on the number accessing the pandemic payment and the number still in employment who are benefiting from the wage subsidy scheme. Therefore, we have an idea that there has been a very significant hit to employment. The Department of Finance believes that by the end of the year, the unemployment rate will be reduced to around 10%. As has been mentioned, that is about 400,000 people, which is 200,000 more than at the start of the year. These figures are subject to considerable uncertainty, however. Not only will there be a demand impact but there will also be a hit to labour supply because people may not want to go back to work owing to childcare considerations or other responsibilities. There is a possibility that even if jobs become available, individuals may not take up the opportunities because of the childcare situation.

In reality, the information we have at present is that the country will be in significant economic difficulty for at least the next two and half years and that for the period after that, there is major uncertainty. Bearing in mind recent items of expenditure, the initial wave of the crisis was expected to have been far higher. In fairness to the Government, much of the procurement was associated with getting the health service in order to deal with the expected wave. Thankfully, it did not materialise. I am talking about the private hospitals and facilities such as that at Citywest. What efforts are being made in the Department to make sure that expenditure on facilities that are not needed will be brought to an end as soon as possible to save the State money?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	413	Obviously, very significant decisions were taken very quickly based on a certain view on the number of cases and the effect of the likely surge on the health system. Thankfully, because of the efforts of citizens, we managed to avoid the very significant surge and ensure enough capacity within the system without having to access the new capacity that was acquired. The deal with the private hospitals, which could have been extended, ended after three months. Obviously, the decision was taken by the Government that that insurance policy was not required but, of course, negotiations will take place on what capacity might be needed in the event of a further outbreak or an increase in the number of cases. What we are now doing, along with our colleagues in the Department of Health, is examining all proposals and options.There are many issues relating to GP costs, the cost of testing and PPE. We are engaged all the time with our colleagues in the Department of Health, looking at the different challenges that the health system has and trying to figure out with them what is best from a health perspective, having regard to the fact that there is a value for money consideration and there is always a constraint regarding resources. Those conversations are ongoing. It is a difficult balance. Many quick decisions were taken for public health, especially in the earlier stages of this crisis. It was essential to do that. They were taken in a different context in a different way from how we would normally take decisions. We had to acquire the capacity in Citywest and in private hospitals and to do deals for PPE as quickly as possible. We hope, given the evolution of the disease and the number of cases, that we will get back to a more normal situation with regard to the relationship that we have with the Department of Health and the decisions that were taken about public health matters.

I also thank local social protection offices. They have been inundated with calls and must have found it very difficult. I have seen the statement by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform indicating that specific arrangements were put in place between it and the Department of Health, involving regular reporting on Covid-19 related health expenditure. What was the health budget for the Covid-19 crisis and how much of it has been spent to date? Do the witnesses have a breakdown of the moneys that were spent?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	415	The overall increase in the allocation was €1.83 billion. That was the amount of additional expenditure that the Government approved. To the end of May, health spending was €1 billion above profile, that is €1 billion above where we thought it would be, and that relates to Covid-19. The overall expectation was that approximately €2 billion would be spent. We will see how that pans out over the next few months and what type of expenditure may have to be incurred in addition to what has already been occurred. As the Department of Health and HSE have mentioned to this committee, there are significant costs relating to testing. We have tested 370,000 people. There will be more testing and that capacity will have to continue to exist. There are more bills related to PPE. As the months roll on, we will see what the bills will be, but €1.83 billion has been allocated to the Department and we will see whether we are below or above that when we see the final bills.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	417	Some 370,000 tests have been completed. The costs are between €100 and €200. It depends on whether the laboratories in Germany or our own laboratories are used. I have a number in my head of between €400 million and €500 million but we can come back to the Deputy with a figure about that.

Is there any plan to rectify this situation in the future? These are the people who got up early in the morning, worked hard, built Ireland and have been left behind again.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	419	I think I have covered that in answers to other questions. That is a matter to be determined by Government. As I pointed out when answering other questions, the pandemic unemployment payment is to substitute for jobseekers' payments, and the terms of those payments are that they are available aged between 18 and 66. In the past, people who were over 66 never sought access to the jobseeker's payment since the pension payment was at a higher rate. There is a concern that because the pandemic unemployment payment was set at a higher level, there may be a disadvantage. That is really to the advantage of the people receiving the pandemic unemployment payment, not to the disadvantage of people on pensions. I mentioned already that the pandemic unemployment payment rate was set at a rate for a two adult household. The pension rate of payment for a two adult household is about €471, so it is still significantly higher than the pandemic unemployment payment. I am not sure that there is a significant disadvantage. People who are in receipt of the State pension have access to other supports which are worth approximately €40 a week.All of those things are in place. Some of the comparisons that are made in this regard are not properly informed. Any change such as the Deputy suggested is a matter for Government and there would be practical steps required, including changes to legislation, if we were to do it.

Does the Department have plans to do that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	421	The wage subsidy scheme is something that will be considered over the next while. The Minister for Finance has already announced that it is being extended to the end of August. Between now and then, the issue of the scheme and its future evolution will have to be considered. It is something that will be determined by a new Government.

I can well imagine the pressures Mr. McKeon's Department was under in this regard but politicians were also under pressure because we ended up being the first point of call for people in most cases. How can the Department make the liaison between itself and us politicians more successful than it has been to date? It is not good enough for politicians just to be handing over a telephone number and telling people to ring it. They feel that once they feed us the information, including PPS numbers and stuff like that, that we should have the answers. We are not able to give those answers at the moment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	423	I would say to the Deputy not to use the Covid-19 experience as evidence of the standard that normally applies. The other thing I should say is to thank Members of the Oireachtas for their support and forbearance and, at times, their patience. The issue we were faced with is that we took four and a half million telephone calls from people who are our clients and we had to prioritise them. We had more than 13 million queries through our website and more than 1 million online claims. We have had to prioritise service to our client base but we have done our best as well to give support through the temporary process that was set up with the Department of the Taoiseach and the Oireachtas instead of parliamentary questions. In the normal situation, each of our offices has a dedicated line which any Member of the Oireachtas can call and those calls are dealt with promptly by the person at the end of that telephone line. If a Member is making a query about a claim for carer's allowance, for example, he or she will be put through to the hotline in our carer's section, and the same applies in respect of disability allowance, pensions and so on. This is generally a service that is well appreciated by Deputies and we hope they will find, as the current pressure abates, that the service is more than adequate.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	424	I start by acknowledging the work the Secretaries General and, in particular, their staff have done during the Covid-19 outbreak. Their two Departments have been critical to the national response and I want to acknowledge that. I do not imagine that either of the witnesses or their teams have had much time off. Their work is greatly appreciated. I have two questions for Mr. McKeon, the first regarding the arts community and the second concerning a technical issue on which some people are getting caught out in respect of the wage subsidy scheme. The arts community is highly vulnerable to the impact of Covid-19. Many people working in the arts are in precarious employment in any case, with a lot of them having to be self-employed and to work very hard. There is not a huge amount of money to be made in the sector and it was one of the first victims of Covid-19 when restrictions meant there could be no live events, theatre shows and so on. I have quite a lot of anecdotal information from people working in the arts that they have struggled to access the unemployment payments. This seems to have come partly from a misunderstanding on the part of some of the staff who were issuing them. I fully accept that those staff have been under incredible pressure dealing with huge volumes of applications. However, to give an example, one writer was told they would not be allowed to access the payment and asked whether they could not just write a book, which belies an understanding of the situation. Will Mr. McKeon take that away and have a think about it? It might be down to internal departmental communications but I have had enough anecdotal evidence to suggest that there is not a sufficient understanding of the fact that those working in the arts really do not have opportunities to find alternative employment at the moment. In regard to the pandemic unemployment payment, a lot of people working in the arts are looking at a very grim number of months ahead or perhaps even a grim year or longer.I refer to people in the arts community who work on live large events, or even medium-sized events, even weddings, be it sound engineers, riggers, lighting technicians, lighting engineers or artists themselves. Is it the current understanding that the pandemic unemployment payment would be extended to them with an understanding that there is simply nothing they can do but wait for their sector to be revived once the restrictions have been relaxed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	425	I thank the Deputy. With regard to the initial comment he made about poor communications and so on, if he can send me an example we will certainly deal with it if he has got a specific case in mind. Generally, people in the arts community, whether it is musicians, visual artists or writers, are considered self-employed and they do have access to the pandemic unemployment payment, so I would be interested to see which people the Deputy is referring to and to get specific examples of difficulties to ensure it is something we can explore, if he has got those examples. There are also other supports available to artists. The Arts Council has introduced a payment - I think it calls it a response award - which is about €3,000. That is available to artists and to the artistic community as well. In general, self-employed artists can avail of the pandemic unemployment payment. I forget the precise terminology we use but they have to declare that they have suffered a substantial and real loss of income to apply, but once they can do that and stand over it, they are eligible for access to the scheme.

I am not basing this on one anecdote. I am basing it on a fair stream of people coming to me over recent months and I am suggesting that there might be an issue within the Department in understanding the complexities it is dealing with. The cases that have come to me would suggest that is the case. I know they are entitled to it, which is the point. I am not asking for Government policy positions, but as Mr. McKeon understands the current policy, for those who have no real hope of returning to their professions in the coming months and potentially longer, is the current policy that the pandemic unemployment payment would continue to be extended to them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	427	The current status is that the Government has extended the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme until August. That will certainly be in place until August. After that, it will be a matter for a new Government to determine. That is all I can say on that matter.

There are employers who have fallen foul of this, including one in my constituency, Tiglin, which is a drug rehabilitation charity. Companies that have changed their accountants during this time period are being refused the wage subsidy scheme. Revenue is telling them that the re-registration now deems their employees to be new employees. It is saying that while it understands that this is not the intended policy, they are now deemed to be new employees. There are companies across the country struggling because they have been completely incorrectly locked out of the wage subsidy scheme from the start because of that. It is very specific. Mr. McKeon does not need to respond if he has nothing to say about it but I ask him to look at it. Revenue has acknowledged it is an issue but has said it has no solution to it. I hope some communication with Mr. McKeon's Department might be able to do something about that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	431	Certainly, we will talk to Revenue. I am not aware of the issue and I do not think that was the intention when the scheme was designed. There may be some technical issue but I will talk to the chair of the Revenue Commissioners and see what we can do.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	432	I thank Mr. McKeon. I have not much time left so this is slightly unfair but can I ask Mr. Watt a question? Obviously, in health there are vast direct Covid-19 expenditures, be it testing and tracing, PPE and a variety of other direct Covid expenditure items. There are already a huge number of indirect items so we are losing from 20% up to 60% of the capacity in our public system. That means we will have to find ways of ramping up capacity. Is there a full-year Estimate for this year and a provisional Estimate for next year on the additional spending on healthcare, not to provide any additional services or to do anything extra but just for the indirect and direct Covid-related costs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	433	The allocation this year in terms of health is almost an additional €2 billion, which is Covid-related. We do not have a figure at this stage for what the outturn will be - that is the projected figure - and we do not have a sense of 2021 yet. Those discussions will begin in earnest in September when we start preparing for the Estimates for 2021. We will have to figure out what additional capacity is required and what, of the policy mix that has been in place, will remain in place and be sustained. That is something we will engage with our colleagues in the Department of Health on, but at this stage we do not have a figure. It is likely that there will need to be more capacity for testing and more capacity generally in the health system. The health system was operating close to 100% last winter, which is not where anybody wants to be. Even in the absence of Covid-19, there is an urgent need to ensure there is more capacity so that we can manage peaks within the system. Of course, with Covid-19 and the possibility of a resurgence of cases, we will have to look at our preparedness for that. That will have financial implications, but we do not have a figure at this stage.

I want to raise a concern I have with regard to seasonal workers, of whom there are a broad range, such as, for instance, people who work for the State Examinations Commission, and we see it in my own area, especially in tourism. The reality is that this does not solely affect one or two families but can infect entire communities in our coastal and island regions. For the majority of these seasonal workers, the bulk of the income they receive is during the summer months. Will band qualification methods take into account income loss this summer? Will they look at the average weekly income over all of 2019 or relevant periods? What exact methods will be used to determine the qualification for bands?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	435	The approach we are using in recalibrating the payment is to examine people's earnings in 2019 and their earnings in January and February of 2020. We will calculate the average weekly earnings for each of those two periods, and whichever is the higher amount will be the basis on which we will determine which band they go into. That is an attempt to try to address any issues of seasonality and so on. For somebody who is self-employed, we will be relying on the 2018 data, and somebody who was not self-employed in 2018 but who was in 2019 will be dealt with on an exceptional basis.

We are aware that people who live in the Twenty-six Counties and work in the Six Counties can claim, but those who live in the Six Counties and work in the Twenty-six Counties cannot. If we are basing payments going forward on tax receipts, why are they being excluded? Did Mr. McKeon provide any recommendations on this?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	437	As I said previously, the pandemic unemployment payment is a substitute for jobseeker's payment. The standard rules of jobseeker's payments apply, which are that people are resident in the State and were in employment before they made a claim. The rules which also apply to those jobseeker's payments, and indeed any social assistance payment, within what are called frontier workers are set down by the European Union. They were subject for a long number of years to debate which culminated in 2004 with Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004. Under that regulation, the country of residence is the competent state for paying social assistance payments, including jobseeker's payments. That is the rule we are following. If that were to change, we would need to change the regulation, I am afraid. It is also the approach that is being followed in other countries, including the UK, in respect of frontier workers.

Mr. McKeon made an interesting point both times I have heard him answer this question specifically on the pension rate for two-pension households. I have come across similar situations, and I will explain one particular case to Mr. McKeon. I was contacted by a man who is over 66 and working to pay his mortgage and bills.His wife is about 59 years of age and is terminally ill with cancer. She cannot work. The loss of that income has had a major impact on the day-to-day lives of those people and there is great concern for their future. Was any consideration given to including people who are working and aged over 66 years in this payment and were any recommendations made?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	439	The system was designed very quickly, but in designing it we looked at how we would apply it. As I said, we apply this payment in the same way as we apply a standard jobseeker's payment. People older than 66 years who are working and lose their jobs do not normally have access to jobseeker's payments and rely on their pension payments. That is the income support provided and legislated for by the Oireachtas for people over 66 years of age. It is generally a more generous support than jobseeker's payments and easier conditions apply. We have applied the same rules, and I reiterate that if we were to deviate from those rules, that would be a matter for the Government and the Oireachtas because I believe legislation would be required.

On SUSI payments, has Mr. McKeon spoken to his colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills about taking into consideration the collapse in income in 2020, rather than considering 2019 only?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	441	I will have to come back to the Deputy on that question, and I will do that.

Picking up on the issue of those aged over 66 years, while I understand the structure and reasons for the approach taken, I am not sure Mr. McKeon's assessment that people on pensions are better off is correct in the context of what was said about relative disadvantage. Many people in that situation were also working to supplement their income, but have now lost that income. From what the Minister said at the time, my understanding was that their income was to be supplemented by one of the range of supplementary welfare allowances or exceptional needs payments and they would not be means tested during this period. Is that the case? I ask that question because I know there have been difficulties regarding this issue and I want to clarify Mr. McKeon's understanding of how this process operates.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	443	There has been no change to how the supplementary welfare system operates. People with an urgent financial need or an ongoing financial need as a consequence of perhaps losing employment or becoming ill, and who are not eligible for an existing social welfare payment, can claim supplementary welfare allowance. That is the safety net. We will make and have made that available to people aged over 66 as we would normally. In one of my earlier answers, I stated that, so far, some 137 people aged over 66 have applied for and received that payment.

I know there was a circular to that effect. I am bringing the matter to Mr. McKeon's attention to let him know there have been several backlog cases. I have raised it with the Department separately and I can do so again rather than spending more time discussing it now. There are a few other anomalies which have left people stuck and unable to move. This includes couples who are separating but have been treated as a unit because they have not been able to move to another property or rent somewhere else as a result of Covid-19. It is the difficult cases that create these tensions, but these practical problems exist. They are very much a minority compared with the overwhelming support that has been quickly provided. It is important to point that out, and I thank Mr. McKeon and his Department for doing that. One case in my area causes me particular concern. It involves a lady who had Covid-19 who had to resign her position, not because of Covid-19 but because she is a single parent and her childcare arrangements are no longer available. Previously, the child went to school and was then taken care of by grandparents and other means. That is no longer possible, however. She has no other means of looking after the child and, as a result, she had to resign her position. How will this woman be treated by the Department in an assessment of eligibility for a Covid-19 payment or jobseeker's allowance?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	445	Generally speaking, in the normal environment, somebody who voluntarily resigns his or her work to care for another person would not be able to avail of jobseeker's payments. Other income supports are available, however, including carer's allowance, parental benefit, etc., and those payments would be made available.The Government's approach this time around has generally been to encourage employers to be as flexible as possible with people and to support people with childcare responsibilities through remote working, annual leave arrangements, force majeure leave and so on. Where that does not work, the Department has stepped up and provided access to income supports, as we always would. Normally this would be done through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. In this case, when people who are unable to go back to work are already on the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, as is generally the case, we have been flexible in allowing them to stay on it. We cannot sustain that in the long or medium term, particularly as childcare arrangements become more regularised and childcare services become available again. In the short term, we have certainly been flexible in our application of the conditionality.

Deputy Cullinane raised a question earlier about the Money Advice & Budgeting Service, MABS, and planning. I had a conversation with MABS and according to the feedback I received, people are aware of the advertising campaign, they are more aware of MABS and they are using the widget, especially late at night when the pressure is particularly on their minds. It is sometimes easier to use that than to pick up a phone. I thank the Department for introducing that. It is very important to plan for the autumn months, when utility bills will become relevant again. It seems to be going well so far. I do not have much time but I would like to ask Mr. Watt about remote working. Remote working has been essential to the continued operation of the economy during this period and it must continue. Broadband has been a huge part of that. What are the plans within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate remote working? I know that yesterday's programme for Government mentions it. Has additional expenditure been allocated to it? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	447	The Civil Service has enabled people to work from home where possible. People in some Departments, such as Mr. McKeon's Department or Revenue, had to go into work. The protocols deal with those people. In the main, however, we have encouraged people who can stay at home and work remotely to do so. We will see if that continues in the future. It can raise a variety of questions about people's preferences and the infrastructure we have in place. It worked very well over the last three months, but there are questions around how long that will last. There are challenges involved in continuing over the next six or 12 months or longer.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	449	The debt outstanding before this crisis was €205 billion. If we have to borrow €25 billion this year, €15 billion next year and a further sum in 2022, that will add another €50 billion in cash terms. That is the broad outline. The deficit could evolve differently over that period and the debt could be lower than that, but that prediction is based on the Department of Finance's April forecasts.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	455	For the next few years, while the European Central Bank, ECB, is buying up the sovereign debt of Ireland and other states across the eurozone, we will not see a spike in rates. The ECB is effectively a backstop. It has announced that its support programme for sovereigns across Europe has increased from €750 billion to €1.35 trillion. That will keep a lid on rates this year and next year, so we will not see a spike. My point referred to the outlook in the longer term, when we have to refinance this debt; not in the next two or three years, but in the next five or six years.Certainly, over the medium to longer term, it is likely that we will have to refinance this debt at rates of interest well above the rates that we have now, and above the average rate of just under 2%. That was the point I was making. The debt is now sustainable and we have to do what we are doing but there is a constraint there. That constraint may not kick in for a period but future generations will have to service this debt and it will cost more to do so.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	457	Those will be issues for the new Government because it will depend on how the economy evolves and decisions it will take. We have done a lot over the past two years and more to get the public finances into shape and to have a surplus for this year, which has been of great benefit as we face this crisis. If we had had a large deficit coming into this crisis, we would be in a much worse position. We also improved the short-term funding position by lowering the level of debt redemptions that were due. Over the past number of years, we had a large amount of debt to redeem. That has taken place so our funding needs over the next few years are lower. A number of decisions have been taken that will put us in a better position than would otherwise have been the case. How we prepare for debt into the future and manage the interest bill will be matters for the new Government. Ultimately, the level of debt and how it is serviced will depend on the nominal growth rate of the economy relative to the interest rate on the debt. That is related to the fiscal balance.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	461	This is an issue that we will take up with the new Government whenever it is in place. We will discuss that. We have our own thoughts and are working on what the options could be. Now that companies and sectors are going back to work, we have an idea of the types of challenges we face. There are companies that will have to go back to work with lower revenues and higher cost bases. They will be in a difficult position. There are companies for which revenue might recover quickly but they will be left with a large overhang of debt because they have not been able to pay their rent or the cost of their lease for a period. There are different types of challenges that the sectors will face. The SME sector does not have an appetite for debt and, therefore, does not want to take it on board, In many cases, SMEs are not in a position to service more debt but still have financing needs. We are looking at a range of options and we will have those conversations with the new Government. Clearly, a lot has been done and we have discussed the size of the deficit, the spending measures and the increase of the debt. There is a lot to be done but I am sure the new Government will be committed to doing more.

Mr. Watt was earlier asked about the tourism sector. Those sectors are particularly weak at this time and will require substantial support not just this year but also next year. Has the Department worked out plans in that area where microbusinesses, in particular, will be sectioned out from the SME sector in general, and will there be specific and targeted supports for them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	463	That is a challenge.The supports that we have put in place, such as the wage subsidy scheme, the restart grant, and the warehousing of debts, have applied across the board to companies in any sector of the economy. We have done some very small, once-off or bespoke measures for particular sectors. There is extra support for the childcare and the beef sectors and I believe that money for the arts was announced today. Generally, the approach has been to provide a wage subsidy scheme and restart grant based on a common criterion that applied to all sectors. When we see the economy getting back to work and when we know that retail, hospitality and certain sectors will be more badly affected, it may make more sense then to have more targeted interventions for those sectors. We are working on what those options might be along with our colleagues in the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Transport, Tourism and Sport. This is about figuring out exactly what the challenge is and how to construct and operationalise a scheme that can work. One of the things we have learned over the past three months is that it is okay to aspire to the pandemic payment, the wage subsidy scheme and the restart grant, but one needs to be able to back it up with the ability to identify firms or individuals who need support and then get money to them quickly. We need to figure out what the needs might be and the mechanism, the criteria, the approach, and then find a way then to get money into firms. We are looking to-----

This question will require a brief answer. I hope he is aware of a situation that I brought to the attention of the Minister through correspondence and parliamentary questions where there are a number, which I hope is small, of employers who have reduced the working time of their staff from five or four to three or two days a week and have then forced their staff to take the remaining days as annual leave. Many are now in a situation where their entire annual leave has been used up. That will create difficulties for them during the summer months in respect of childcare and other issues. It is an absolutely deplorable practice on the part of employers. When I have raised this with the Department, it has indicated that the employer is within its legal rights to do this. This is probably not best practice but it is legal. Does Mr. Watt believe that legislation needs to be amended in that regard? This is a "Yes" or "No" question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	468	I am not aware of the correspondence the Deputy has had with the Minister but I have heard media reports of people being forced to take leave or arrangements being entered into between employers and employees on how they can manage the period ahead, sustaining and trying to support people’s income while the demand for their services is lower. I am not sure of the legal position. If the Deputy says-----
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	469	I will get this information for Mr. Watt. Essentially, the response I have received is that this is legal and a direction for the staff in question to go to the Workplace Relations Commission, which is clearly is not optimal. It would be better if legislation was on the side of these workers. On the wage subsidy scheme, does Mr. Watt have a view as to whether this should be extended to the end of the year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	470	No, I do not. The new Government will decide. The subsidy has been extended to August. The new Government will decide during the summer months what we do after that. This will depend on how quickly people get back to work, the extent to which the economy restarts, and the numbers of people still on the scheme and receiving the pandemic payment.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	471	This has been one of the most important schemes during this pandemic and has allowed businesses to remain afloat. I hope that it will be extended, particularly for those businesses that will not otherwise survive and who need that support to retain their workforce. Nobody likes pointing to anomalies but when it came to the pandemic payment, there was a situation where people pointed to the anomalies and almost tried to pit one recipient of the payment against another. Is it true that some companies have remained profitable throughout this period and are still in the wage subsidy scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	472	The eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy scheme set out that a company has to demonstrate a 25% fall in revenue.

So it depends on-----

Does he think it would be unfair and ironic for an employer who is drawing down the wage subsidy scheme to be pointing the finger at staff representatives who are in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment? Does he think that would be unfair or at least ironic on their part?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	476	If they are saying that the pandemic unemployment payment should be reduced because some people are better off, irony might be one way of putting it.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	477	It might be suggested that if those companies are pointing their finger at some of their staff and suggesting they won the lotto, the corollary regarding the wage subsidy scheme is that they have won the EuroMillions. If there comes a point where an incoming Government decides it needs to restrict the wage subsidy scheme, would Mr. Watt agree that it would be more appropriate to direct it at those sectors and businesses that need it most, as opposed to it being abolished altogether?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	478	The wage subsidy scheme was devised over a very short period of time in response to this crisis. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, has made a number of significant changes over the last few months as we have seen how the scheme has evolved and its impact. Mr. McKeon has mentioned those changes already. The Minister and the Government have announced the extension of the scheme to August. I think it was originally due to end on 10 or 12 June, so it has gone beyond its original date. There are many issues around policy and how we support companies towards the end of the summer months. There are many difficult challenges. It is very hard to know exactly what supports to put in place. The approach has been to provide economy-wide supports. That makes it simpler and easier for the Revenue Commissioners to administer. All of these things have to be guided by the ability of Revenue to administer these schemes. If one focuses on particular sectors and says that only certain sectors will benefit beyond a certain date, of course there will be companies in other sectors that feel they also need continuing support and are being unfairly excluded. One could make the argument that because some sectors are not as badly affected as others, support should be targeted. The approach to targeting we have adopted has been the 25% reduction in revenue. There are many options one could take in changing that criterion. We will turn our attention to the various options with the new Government and try to come up with a view. I agree with the Deputy that the impact of the wage subsidy scheme has been absolutely critical. Without the scheme we would probably have had another 400,000 to 500,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment. They would not have a link to their employer and they would not have their pay being topped up by their employer - over 80% of employees are receiving some type of top-up, which is great - so the scheme has been very effective. As to how it continues and in what form, the Government has made a commitment until the end of August and we will see after that.

If I am repeating a question it is because I was not actually here. On the matter of the backlog of money that is due to people waiting to get their payments, is there a timeline as to when that may happen? If I heard correctly when I was here, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is addressing it. Everybody respects and acknowledges the fantastic work it is doing and the way it has turned hundreds of thousands of applications around. However, the issue still affects a number of people. That is my first question. My second question relates to people who are getting older but are still at work. Those aged under 66 years who were working when this happened will receive the pandemic payment until their 66th birthday. If their employment continues thereafter, they will receive a payment under the temporary wage subsidy scheme and, if not, they will receive the pension payment to which they would have been entitled or a social welfare assessment of the means of the household will be done? Is that a fair summary of the position? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	481	On the backlog, a number of people are due arrears because we were late getting their payment commenced. We believe that number is relatively small. As I explained earlier, many people think they are due arrears but because the payment is made one week in arrears, they will find when they return to work that they receive a payment in their first week in work. We cannot sort this out easily. We must examine about 730,000 claims and about 688,000 individual payments made to people. That is a very big job and our current focus is on making the 500,000 payments we make weekly under the pandemic unemployment payment and the roughly 1.5 million other payments we make under other schemes. We are setting up an IT process to help us get through the challenge of reviewing all the claims. We expect that will be up and running in the next couple of months and we will be able to start making the payment of arrears that are due in the third quarter. At that stage, I suspect many people will have found that they received payment for an extra week at the end of the payment period, which will resolve the issue. I have dealt with pensions in response to other Deputies' questions. The position is relatively straightforward, although it seems anomalous to some people. The pandemic unemployment payment is a substitute for the normal jobseeker's payment, which is for those aged between 18 and 66 years. The State, and the Oireachtas, have provided for a standard age-related payment, the State pension, for those over 66 years. In the normal course, this is a better payment made on better terms than the jobseeker's payment. That is the position that applies to people aged over 66 years. I am aware that some people feel they are being disadvantaged because the payment of the pandemic unemployment payment is based on a two-person household. An individual gets a higher basic rate under the pandemic unemployment payment but a two-person household still gets €350 under that payment. Most people in receipt of the State pension are getting €470 for a two-person household so they are still better off. However, people are comparing the €350 basic rate with the €240 basic rate and forgetting about the second payment. In most cases, the pension is still a better outcome.

Many people aged 66 years or over who are still working do not have anyone living with them. They would receive the pandemic unemployment payment were it not for their age. They believe that is age discrimination. Different people have different views but given that the pension age is under consideration, it seems very unfair that some people, even if it is a small number, are being discriminated against solely on age grounds. One of my constituents is a sole trader who has one person employed temporarily with him. The temporary employee is getting much more money than the sole trader is because the latter is aged over 66 years. He has a very small pension entitlement and lives on his own. He has various other problems and he feels discriminated against. Mr. McKeon stated that legislation may be required. Would it be possible to change the regulations to provide that community welfare officers or social welfare officers may review the cases of people in this exceptional category and increase their incomes to €350? No one would be due a bonanza but this would show respect to those affected and their incomes would not exceed those of anyone else on the pandemic unemployment payment. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	483	That is something that could be examined.I think in the first instance the Government would have to make a decision effectively to increase the rate of pension pay, which would be an enormous decision, because it would be very difficult to say to a pensioner who was not working that a pensioner is getting €350 because he or she happened to work in January or February, but as the first pensioner was not so-----

The point I wish to make again is that it would and should only continue for the duration of the pandemic unemployment payment and the income could not exceed €350. All of the other issues pale into insignificance in the face of the charge of age discrimination, which in my view is not acceptable.

First, I join my colleagues in thanking Mr. McKeon and all the staff of his Department for the work that has been done in recent months in making sure that people receive payments and in processing applications. At the start of this year there was a plan to separate the front office and back office functions in the mid-west and to consolidate the back office in one particular location. I do not know what medical advice Mr. McKeon is receiving in light of Covid-19, but I suspect there would be a reluctance to consolidate all back office functions in one location in the mid-west. Will Mr. McKeon outline where that plan is at currently?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	490	Certainly. To explain the concept of front office and back office, in the traditional model, which dates back quite a long time, all claims for jobseeker and one-parent family payments were taken in a particular office which had a catchment area, and they were dealt with and maintained in that office and never moved out it. That was relevant at a time when we made cash payments over the counter and it continued for a long time thereafter. However, with modern digital technology the work can be allocated anywhere once the claim is received. It is more efficient to spread the workload and to allocate it to locations based on availability of staff rather than to have it all concentrated in one area for one catchment area. That is what the front office and back office is about. We were never going to have just one back office. There were going to be a number of back offices and that would still be our plan. Obviously, we are going to take the learnings from the Covid experience and the fact that a lot of staff are able to process claims from home, so perhaps we will move on beyond that plan, but that is something we will need to discuss with the staff representative organisations in the first instance.

Mr. Watt mentioned value for money in the context of testing at a cost of €100 to €200. When Dr. Cillian De Gascun was before the committee he seemed to think that the cost of testing in the national laboratory was €60. I appreciate that there is a finite capacity in that laboratory. Was value for money obtained or was it even possible at the time to look at value for money? Was it a matter of just needing to get the capacity in place regardless of what it cost?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	492	I am not sure about the exact cost. I think the costs differ depending on whether they go to the laboratories here in Ireland or to the laboratory in Germany. Clearly, it was absolutely essential to get testing capacity in place. That was the imperative and the decision was taken that we had to do that, whatever the cost.

Nobody could second-guess what was going to be required at the time. Are we still paying for a testing capacity that is not being utilised?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	494	I think some of the costs are fixed costs that we are incurring anyway, and there is an element of costs that are variable costs. We can come back to you, Chairman, on the breakdown. I think it depends on which option we are pursuing, but I do not think all of the costs are per test. I think we incur some costs to have access to capacity as needed. We can come back to you on the details of that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	496	I am sure we can, Chair. I am sure we can have a look and see what the correspondence was.

Is Mr. Watt happy that, as we move forward, we are now getting value for money on testing? Contracts were entered into at some point and I presume they are finite in length.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-06-16 00:00:00	Business of Special Committee	498	I understand there is now a review of what is required and the Government will be asked to decide on what the policy is, into the future, on testing. There are issues around the number of tests, the criteria for tests, the capacity and the cost. A review is being undertaken of what is required and the Government will make decisions on that.

We are approaching two hours so I thank the witnesses for coming in and answering all of our questions. I also thank the staff who were here today. Is it agreed to request the clerk to seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting today? Agreed.
