            <p eId="para_20">The Minister is heartily welcome. I thank him for coming in to take this Commencement matter. I am very excited about this application, which will be before him for consideration under the urban regeneration and development fund 2018. If funded and delivered, this project will be transformational not just for the town of Ballina but for north Mayo, east Mayo and south Sligo, which tie into the hinterland of that particular town. There are many challenges in the town and its environs. High unemployment still persists, notwithstanding so much success on the part of the Government nationally. The history of this town is that it was the major shopping or retail town going back generations. It was the place to come. It has lovely streetscapes and is pretty glorious to look at. Obviously the face of retail has changed. Small shops have changed. These are realities we have to contend with and to which we have to try to find solutions. We have to reimagine how depressed town centres can be revitalised. I know from previous conversations that is what the Minister is about. That is why I am delighted that he is here today.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> Notwithstanding what I have said, we in Ballina and the surrounding areas have so much more to offer. We have so much more going for us than we have going against us. I see this fund as providing an injection, stimulus, or catalyst that will address so many issues that need addressing, encourage growth, enterprise and innovation, provide renewal in the very centre of the town, and restore it to its former glory. That would be my ambition. We have excellent broadband capacity, which is something that is not said too much in rural Ireland. We have a metropolitan area network and backhaul connectivity. That was installed by Enet at the time. We have connection with a transatlantic high-speed fibre optic cable which comes in just a few kilometres down the road. We are connected into that. We are lit, as they say. We also have a great tradition in respect of multinational companies. We have Coca-Cola and Hollister. We have five multinationals in the environs of Ballina alone. They have been there a long time and they are happy doing business there. Above all, we offer quality of life. We have never had so much investment in sports facilities and arts facilities. We have a whole package. We have houses and school places.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> As part of the Minister's ambitions for Project Ireland 2040 and for rebalancing out from the big urban centres and growth in smaller areas of population, we want that €500,000 to grow outside of a big urban centre. Strategic projects such as this are the ones that need funding because they will have a knock-on or domino effect. This particular project is a unique collaboration between a local authority, Mayo County Council, a development company, Moy Valley Resources, and SMAKS Luxury Group. This is an international private investor which produces very high-end rum. It wants to locate here and bring money to the table as part of the local contribution for this. Then there is Blackstone Launchpad in the National University of Ireland, Galway. It is going to provide third level outreach. It is a challenge in some of these rural areas to get third level colleges active and to allow them to bring what they have to offer to the table to allow us to expand and grow. We are talking about a digital hub for 20 start-ups, which would be all kitted out.</p>
            <p eId="para_23">We are talking about an innovation and enterprise centre. There is a regeneration fund under the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. What we propose, in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland and the development company and with the approval of the Western Development Commission, would address the underrepresentation of women and migrants in enterprise and intergenerational problems people sometimes experience in accessing employment. The course, including supports, would be run from this centre and it would provide for start-up, seed and scaling of enterprise. It would be delivered in a mentored fashion. The expertise would be provided by the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG, and I have met those involved who are on board with the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> The proposed digital hub speaks for itself. This is not a case of providing a digital hub in the hope that people will roll up. Work has been done by surveying and assessing the demand that exists and the supports that have been offered in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner. There will also be a private investor located in the building, providing jobs. Once the building is refurbished, it will be a tourism hub.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Should we secure the funding to refurbish the military barracks, which was built in 1742 and is the centre point around which the town was built, we will regenerate the whole town. The French who landed in Killala to participate in the 1798 rebellion pushed the British from the barracks. The town is a rich tapestry of history and needs modern day revitalisation. There are brilliant stakeholders, whom I have mentioned. The members of the chamber of commerce have a can do and will do attitude. I ask the Minister for his support and to take this on board in his deliberations.

            <p eId="para_26">I thank Senator Mulherin for raising this very important issue. The urban regeneration and development fund was established under Project Ireland 2040 to support more compact and sustainable development through the regeneration and rejuvenation of Ireland's five cities and other large towns in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan, NDP, 2018-2027 and the 20 year national planning framework, NPF. The fund is designed to enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns and to ensure more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live, work and invest and also visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> In the 2019 budget, I have secured €71 million for the first year of the fund's operation, which will commence next year. I initiated the first call proposals under the fund in July 2018 and the deadline for submission of applications was 28 September 2018. My Department received 189 applications for funding which are currently being assessed. The assessment process is following a pre-assigned assessment criteria framework and a three-stage process with recommendations being made to a project advisory board. The board will then report to a management committee, which will make recommendations to me by the end of November.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Submissions differ in scale, complexity and are multi sectoral in nature, with a wide variety of public bodies having applied, including local authorities, Departments, State agencies and public bodies in collaboration with other sectoral partners. The proposals contain a large number of themes and sectoral areas, including urban regeneration, public realm, enterprise development, community facilities, redevelopment of existing or vacant areas, enabling strategic infrastructure to leverage further development, cultural facilities and amenity development. There are two categories of submission, category A for projects that are ready to go and category B to support the initial development of projects, such as master planning or feasibility studies to ensure a pipeline of projects into the future. The fund is oversubscribed in both categories A and B on a proportion of well over 4:1 for 2019. There is, therefore, considerable competition for this funding and investment in large towns and cities. </p>
            <p eId="para_29"> As the assessment process of the project advisory board is ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment further on individual projects at this time. However, I can indicate clearly that it is my intention to announce the first round of funding allocations as soon as possible after the assessment process has concluded later this month. I know Senator Mulherin has put much work into this particular project, is highly supportive of this application for Ballina and she sees herself as a champion for the area. She will know very shortly whether the plan has been successful under this new fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for coming in to take this issue. The matter I raise on the Commencement is the need for the Taoiseach to outline the numbers by gender breakdown of those employ in small, medium and large businesses, respectively. I have been asked by the National Women's Council to raise this issue. I first tabled it as a Commencement matter to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in the belief that it was a matter for her Department. I was advised, however, that it is a matter for the Central Statistics Office, which falls within the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach. I have certainly learned from this experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> I raise the matter in the context of forthcoming legislation on pay transparency. Put simply, the Bill in question will address the ongoing gender pay gap. Women in Ireland still earn on average 14% less than men. We marked the day this year when women effectively stop earning, as compared with their male colleagues, on Tuesday of this week. It is known as gender pay gap day. This issue applies broadly, not only in Ireland, and European Union gender pay gap day was marked last Saturday, the EU pay gap being even wider than Ireland's. It is an issue we have to address and measures to address it have been adopted in other countries. These include gender pay gap wage transparency legislation, which requires companies to publish data on an anonymised basis about the gender breakdown of employees and the pay rates of those employees. I introduced a gender pay gap Bill in the Oireachtas, which passed all Stages in the Seanad in October 2018. The Government has made proposals for similar legislation but so far has only published heads of a Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">I have certainly expressed concern, as have my Labour Party colleagues, that if the Government had been minded to adopt our Bill, that could have become law much more swiftly and we would have been able to see greater change for women more swiftly. The issue here is the effect in practice of the Government legislation, as opposed to our legislation because our legislation proposed that it would apply to all companies employing more than 50 employees. Thus far, the Government heads of Bill suggest it will initially only apply the legislation to companies with 250 or more staff and then, on a phased basis, move to companies employing 50 or more staff. I have spoken at various different events on equal pay and have been told that women tend to be over-represented or represented to a greater degree in small and medium enterprises. That is certainly the case in the British statistics and I would like to know if it is the case in Ireland. If so, the Government legislation is much less likely to have the same immediate impact on women in employment as our legislation would have given that the latter envisages immediate application to companies employing 50 or more staff, rather than having to wait for a period of time. </p>
            <p eId="para_36"> I spoke recently at an event in the arts centre about our gender pay gap Bill and was told that very few arts organisations employ more than 50 people. This is a sector where women are well represented. Therefore, the likelihood is that even our legislation would not have any immediate impact on women in the arts because so few arts organisations employ 50 staff. We must be realistic but it would be very helpful for us in drafting and bringing forward legislation, be it the Government Bill or our Bill, to know the gender breakdown of employees of small businesses as opposed to medium and large businesses. That is the context in which I raise this issue. I understand the information has been sought from the Central Statistics Office previously but it was not forthcoming or readily available, hence my raising of this Commencement matter. I thank the Minister of State again for taking it. </p>

          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Employment_Affairs_and_Social_Protection" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (Deputy Finian McGrath)<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_37">I thank the Senator for raising this very important issue. I am dealing with this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, who cannot be here. The Minister of State has delegated responsibility for the Central Statistics Office arising from the Statistics (Delegation of Ministerial Functions) Order 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The matter in question relates specifically to the available CSO statistics with regard to the gender breakdown of those employed in business by business size. Policy matters relating to business are a matter for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and policy matters relating to gender equality are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality. Any policy issues arising should, therefore, be raised with the appropriate Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> Unfortunately, the exact information requested by Senator Bacik is not available from the Central Statistics Office. I am informed that the CSO's official source of statistics regarding size of enterprise is sourced from its business demography data but these statistics, which are based on administrative data supplied by the Revenue Commissioners, do not include information on the gender of the persons engaged in these enterprises. In addition, this business demography data only include the business economy and, therefore, exclude sectors such as public administration and defence, including compulsory social insurance, education, human health and social work activities and some other services sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> Taking these factors into account, it can be noted that in 2016, this source showed that the total number of persons engaged in active small enterprises, namely, those with fewer than 50 persons engaged, was 720,401. The number of persons engaged in active medium enterprises, namely, between 50 and 249 persons engaged, was 290,604. The number of persons engaged in active large enterprises, namely, 250 and more persons engaged, was 467,231. Clearly, therefore, a large number of people work in small enterprises. It should be noted that these totals include the business economy only and cannot be further disaggregated by gender. </p>
            <p eId="para_41"> An additional source of relevant information from the CSO is the labour force survey, LFS, which provides statistics broken down by gender. The purpose of this survey is the production of quarterly labour force estimates and information is collected continuously throughout the year from households surveyed each week and each quarter. The LFS is the official source of labour market statistics for Ireland. The primary classification used for the LFS results is the International Labour Office, ILO, labour force classification. The ILO classification distinguishes three main subgroups of the population aged 15 or over, namely, persons in employment, persons who are unemployed and inactive population. Persons in employment are defined as those who worked in the week before the survey for one hour or more for payment or profit, including work on the family farm or business, and all persons who had a job but were not at work because of illness, holidays, etc., in the week. The LFS includes a number of detailed questions asked of those respondents who have been classified as being in employment. One of these questions asks respondents for their estimate of the total number of persons who work in their place of employment. However, as this question is reported by the respondent and refers to the number of employees at the local place of employment of the respondent, it does not directly correspond to the business demography data to which I referred. However, the LFS include information on the gender of the respondent and incorporates all sectors of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> The most recent figures available from the labour force survey are for quarter 2 of 2018. These indicative figures show that in the second quarter, the split by gender for the number of persons working in a local place of employment with between one and 49 persons was 49.7% male and 50.3% female. The split by gender for those working in a place of employment with between 50 and 249 persons was 51.6% male and 48.4% female. These are interesting figures. Finally, the split by gender for those working in a place of employment with 250 or more persons was 58.7% male and 41.3% female. In addition, it can be noted that no answer regarding the number of persons at a place of employment was given by 27,000 males, a figure that represented 2.2% of all males in employment, and no answer was given by 19,300 females, a figure that represented 1.9% of all females in employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> The number of males classified as self-employed with no employees was 172,700, while the number of females classified as self-employed with no employees was 54,200. I am also informed that a series of detailed LFS employment statistics showing additional data on the number of persons in employment at the respondents' place of work and also offering various additional classifications of persons are due for publication on the CSO website at 11 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> As I mentioned, any matters of policy arising from these figures should be raised with the relevant Minister. It is important to state, however, that gender equality is a significant priority for the Government. The programme for Government includes a number of measures designed to promote and increase gender equality and significant progress has been made on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I find it extraordinary that the precise data sought in the question are not available. It would seem to be a very simple matter to obtain a gender breakdown of those employed in small, medium and large businesses, respectively. Surely it is important for policymakers, particularly those in Government, to know the gender breakdown of companies when formulating legislation on wage transparency in order to arrive an appropriate figure at which the duty of disclosure of wage rates would arise. I am concerned about this.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> The Minister of State's answer explains the reasons the National Women's Council has been unable to obtain this information until now. I thank him for elaborating on the labour force survey figures. It is of interest to see the immense gender disparity between men and women in the self-employed category. It is interesting to note from the CSO figures the large number of people who are employed in small enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> I will raise policy issues, particularly my concern around the absence of the key data I sought, with the relevant Ministers. It is appropriate to raise this concern with them in the context of the ongoing debate on the gender pay gap Bill. I very much hope the Government will see fit to adopt my Bill given how many people are employed in small industries. If nothing else, the Minister of State's response has certainly shown us that this is the area where a vast number of people are employed and the area we need to tackle to address the overall gender pay gap.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">I take Senator Bacik's point about data, the gender breakdown and policymakers having this information. I will convey her view to the Government because it is an important part of developing policy on gender equality and employment issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">We have to have reliable data and information on issues like that. Building on the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to advance gender equality, the Government has advanced a number of specific initiatives in 2018. These are in line with the aims and objectives of the national strategy for women and girls, which seeks to change attitudes and practices preventing women and girls from fully participating in education, employment and public life at all levels. The strategy contains 139 actions to advance the equality of women and girls. It includes actions to promote the socio-economic equality of women and girls, to advance their physical and mental well-being, to ensure their visibility in society and their equal and active citizenship, to advance women in leadership and decision-making and to combat violence against women. </p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Work is under way, in consultation with stakeholders across civil society and professional bodies, on a wide range of actions to achieve this. Last June, the Government approved a general scheme of a gender pay gap wage transparency Bill, which will promote wage transparency by requiring companies to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results showing the gender pay gaps. It also provides for a range of enforcement mechanisms. A new initiative, Better Balance for Better Business, a business review group, was announced in July to promote better gender balance. </p>

            <p eId="para_52">I welcome the Minister of State to the House again today. It is always nice to see him. He has had a great interest in health over a number of years. My Commencement matter is the need for the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to provide an update on plans for a fixed catheterisation laboratory, cath lab, at Sligo University Hospital. For many years, my colleague, Deputy McLoughlin, has campaigned strongly for such a lab. This facility is vital. It provides a diagnostic service for patients with suspected heart disease or heart attacks. The hospital is currently served by a mobile cath lab, which provides services one day a week for elective procedures only.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> There are also a number of cath labs in Galway that serve acute cardiac cases for Sligo and the north-west region. I understand that, in addition to the numbers treated in Sligo University Hospital, the hospital refers approximately 300 patients each year to St James' Hospital and the Mater Private Hospital. There is, however, now a compelling need for a permanent cath lab in Sligo. There is a critical 90-minute window in the event of someone having a heart attack. For those living in Sligo and the north west, this is a major challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> Accessing the timely care needed has been hindered by geography and the road infrastructure but more importantly, the lack of access to life-saving cardiac services. It takes at least two hours to travel from Sligo to Dublin by ambulance and a similar length of time to travel to Galway. There is an air ambulance which can get a patient to Galway or Dublin quickly but it may not always be available. It is clear to me that those living in Sligo, Leitrim, north Roscommon, south Donegal and west Cavan deserve a fixed cath lab. Cardiac patients will otherwise continue to be challenged by having to travel long journeys to receive the care they need. </p>
            <p eId="para_55"> There has been some progress on the issue of a cath lab at Sligo but it is extremely slow. A business case for a fixed facility has been submitted nationally and I understand this might not be advanced until the national review of cardiac services is completed. The Minister of State might shed some light on this and when this review is likely to be completed. I have to ask a question which has been posed many times. Why should cardiac patients in the north west be forced to go on long journeys to Galway or Dublin? What benefits can there be in this for a heart attack patient in this region? I must also highlight a clear cost element. In the past 15 years, I understand that the Health Service Executive, HSE, has spent €10.5 million transferring 550 cardiology patients each year from Sligo to Galway or Dublin. In addition, €3.6 million has been spent over this period renting a temporary visiting lab in Sligo. Why can the HSE not invest the money in the provision of a fixed cath lab? </p>

          <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_13" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Employment_Affairs_and_Social_Protection">
            <from>Deputy Finian McGrath<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_56">I thank Senator Feighan for raising this important issue. He is committed to developing and expanding health services, particularly in the west of Ireland and, in this case, in Sligo University Hospital. It is an important issue and it gives me the opportunity to provide an update. The Government is committed to ensuring that all citizens have access to safe, high quality and evidence-based care in line with international norms. Sligo University Hospital provides high quality healthcare to the people of Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan. There are currently two cath labs based in Galway, which service acute cardiac cases for Sligo and the north west. For elective cases, a mobile cath lab unit operates for one day a week in Sligo and Letterkenny.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> The 2013 report of the north-west cardiology review group recommended that opportunities presented by the proximity of Altnagelvin Hospital to Letterkenny should be explored to see if co-operation arrangements could be agreed. This recommendation has now been implemented. There is a cross-Border arrangement with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry to provide cath lab services and primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, to people in the north west. That is something that has come up in recent days as well in the broader Brexit debate. It is important that such cross-Border arrangements are continued and especially in respect of health issues. It is also important to note that specialist cardiac catheterisation lab services are provided in a small number of hospitals in order to ensure that the services provided achieve the required standards of safety, quality and sustainability in the interests of patients. </p>
            <p eId="para_58"> Earlier this year a steering group was established, chaired by Professor Philip Nolan, to undertake a national review of specialist cardiac services. The steering group comprises 15 members including health professionals, patients, HSE management and officials from my Department. The review will also consider the responses gathered from a public consultation. I am sure that will include the views of the people of the north west and people throughout the country who responded. This consultation is in keeping with the Government’s commitment to incorporating the views of our citizens. </p>
            <p eId="para_59"> The aim of the review is to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with a particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service. The review will incorporate rigorous reviews of evidence and data, international peer review and stakeholder consultation. This review began on 31 January and is ongoing. It is expected that the work will be completed by the end of June 2019. I expect the review will provide a blueprint for the future of adult cardiac services. As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac catheterisation laboratories, and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally, will be informed by the outcome of the national review.</p>

I know there are stakeholder consultations but the review started on 31 January and will not be complete until June 2019, which means it will have taken a year and half. I am not familiar with the complexities but that seems like a long time to have a review.

I will bring those points to the Minister for Health. I assure Senator Feighan that the provision of a cath lab in Sligo University Hospital is being considered under the national review of specialist cardiac services. That is due to be completed in June 2019. I will bring the two key points which Senator Feighan raised to the Minister, Deputy Harris and push that matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I thank the Minister for coming to the House. Sunday, 25 November is the UN international day for the elimination of violence against women. Can we imagine an Ireland where women and children are free from domestic violence? One in four women experiences physical or sexual violence from a partner and one in three experiences severe psychological abuse. If we were to apply those averages to this House, five out of 15 female Senators could be survivors of some form of intimate partner abuse. Across the country as a whole, we would be looking at approximately 475,000 women. What a transformation it would be for them if they were free from violence and abuse. Unfortunately, such an Ireland is difficult for many of us to imagine and that is why each and every one of us must do our utmost to support women experiencing abuse. Virtually all of us, as public representatives, will have been approached by women in difficult circumstances. While we may be able to give them advice, a listening ear or even, in some cases, refuge in our own homes, what is needed is a co-ordinated response.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> The adoption of the Domestic Violence Act in May this year was very significant. It marked a sea change in our understanding of domestic violence and I commend the Minister, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, and former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on having delivered such legislation. It has made protecting and supporting those experiencing violence a priority, and it has broadened our understanding of intimate partner abuse, particularly by providing for a new criminal offence of coercive control. It also includes provisions which move us closer to ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, otherwise known as the Istanbul Convention. It is in this area that I am seeking clarification from the Minister today.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> There can be no real equality between women and men unless women experiencing gender-based violence are fully supported by State agencies and institutions. There are some fantastic voluntary organisations, such as Safe Ireland which has its headquarters in my home town of Athlone, and Women’s Aid which provides services and support for women experiencing domestic violence. They do a fantastic job and we need to ensure we match their commitment and dedication by doing our part. I note that the Minister is fully committed to ratifying the convention, and I am seeking an update from him of where we are on that journey.</p>

            <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_66">It is a privilege to share time on this very important issue with such an advocate as Senator McFadden. Her articulation of the importance of this convention being ratified speaks volumes. We are a great country when it comes to honouring our international obligations. We dragged our feet for long enough with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and we let ourselves down in that instance, but I have no doubt that we will not let ourselves down in respect of the Istanbul Convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> In the years since Deputy Flanagan took over as Minister, a lot has happened in terms of protecting women, such as the introduction of legislation on domestic violence and resourcing An Garda Síochána to its current level, which has meant the force has a new dynamic in dealing with violence against women. Violence against women and vulnerable people is abhorrent in our society and needs to be eradicated. It is a disease that should not exist in the modern world. We are a first world country and, as such, we need to take our international obligations seriously. I know that we will.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> We advocated for the convention that became the Istanbul Convention. The people, of all parties and none, who represent this Parliament at the Council of Europe articulated this issue. It was formulated by our parliamentarians and other good parliamentarians throughout Europe and further afield. We need to transpose the convention into law to show that we espouse the complete elimination of domestic violence against women. I know the Minister will reflect these views in his response, but we would especially like a timeline from him.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T11:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_69">I thank Senator Conway and Senator McFadden for raising this matter. I assure all the Senators in the House of my commitment as Minister for Justice and Equality, and that of Government, to do everything we can to tackle violence against women. This violence is a blight on our society and its complexity requires a systemic, multifaceted response.</p>
            <p eId="para_70"> The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, commonly known as the Istanbul Convention, is a significant legal instrument in combating sexual and domestic violence and the programme for Government is committed to its implementation. The convention is a broad-based document which covers a number of Departments’ policy areas. The purposes of this convention are to protect women against all forms of violence and to prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women and domestic violence. The convention also aims to ensure the design of a comprehensive framework, policies and measures for the protection of and assistance to all victims of such violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> Senators will be aware that Ireland signed the Istanbul Convention in November 2015. At the time, the Government gave approval to an action plan which contained those outstanding actions that were identified as being necessary to enable Ireland’s ratification of the convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">Those 18 actions were included in the second national strategy for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence which was published in January 2016. The implementation of this whole-of-government strategy which contains a range of actions to be implemented across Departments and agencies is ongoing. I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Stanton, in particular, in that regard. I also acknowledge the contributions of Members of this and the Lower House, particularly those of Senators McFadden and Conway.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"><b>
							</b>Progress in implementing the actions required to be taken under the Istanbul Convention includes the training of public sector officials, implementation of the victims directive, development and implementation of a risk assessment matrix by An Garda Síochána for victims of domestic violence and sexual crime. I acknowledge and welcome what Senator Conway said as far as An Garda Síochána is concerned, but, of course, there is more to be done. Enactment of the Domestic Violence Bill 2018 in May significantly advanced progress in ratifying the convention. This groundbreaking legislation delivers on a number of Istanbul Convention actions, including emergency barring orders, extending access to interim barring orders and creating an offence of forced marriage. It is my intention to commence the Act in January. The agencies that are key to implementing the legislation are working to that end.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> There remains one outstanding legislative action before Ireland can ratify the Istanbul Convention, that is, legislating for extraterritorial jurisdiction. This technical legislation will provide for individuals who commit particular offences abroad being liable to prosecution under Irish law. It is my intention to publish the legislation in the very near future. Its early enactment will enable ratification of the convention. It is my intention to ratify the convention early in 2019 and have the legislation enacted prior to that.</p>

            <p eId="para_75">I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to deal with this matter. It is the obligation of the State to fully address the issue of violence against women in all of its forms and to take measures to prevent such violence, protect its victims and, most importantly, prosecute the perpetrators. That is why it is essential that all elements of the Domestic Violence Act be fully implemented and that the remaining legislation and other actions needed to progress be pursued as a matter of urgency. I thank the Minister for his presence and commitment thus far.</p>

            <p eId="para_76">It is rare for a Minister to come into the House to answer questions. The Minister is spot on as the timeframe is clear and unambiguous. As a unit, the women of Ireland should be very pleased with the information he has given, for which I thank him. I again commend An Garda Síochána, in particular the Commissioner, Mr. Drew Harris. I listened carefully to his commentary at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and his commitment to ensuring An Garda Síochána is responsive, reflective and flexible to ensure it not just acts against but also seeks to prevent domestic violence is refreshing. I would like the message to be sent to the women of Ireland that the Government and An Garda Síochána are committed to a policy of zero tolerance of any violence against women and vulnerable adults.</p>

            <p eId="para_77">I repeat that implementation is continuing of the actions contained in the second national strategy for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. I am very keen to ensure the strategy will be part of the focus of all interested parties. I acknowledge what the Senators have said about enactment of the domestic violence legislation being a major step forward in enabling us to ratify the Istanbul Convention. It is my intention to publish in the coming weeks the final item of legislation required for ratification. I would like to have it published before the end of November. We will then have three weeks before the Christmas vacation, within which I will be very keen to make progress. In that regard, I look forward to the constructive engagement of the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is technical legislation, but in working together we can ensure its early enactment. It is my firm intention to ensure the Istanbul Convention will be ratified as soon as practicable thereafter. The timeframe for its ratification is early 2019.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">Clearly, we are all on tenterhooks regarding the Brexit negotiations and how the deal will unfold. As things are moving at pace across the water in the United Kingdom, at this point it is hard to figure out exactly where it will land. Having had a cursory look at the text, on the face of it, it seems to be a very good deal for Ireland. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste should be commended on the work put in so far.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">Obviously, we need to ensure the deal can be brought home. There is no point in celebrating until we see that it can be properly implemented and is agreed to by our neighbours across the water. I will leave it at that for now.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> The second item I wish to raise affects a lot of senior citizens. They are receiving scam calls from international numbers. If they answer them, they are charged up to €20. They are also receiving scam calls from Irish numbers. Callers purport to be representatives of Eir or other telecommunications companies and tell them that the Internet is down. They are instructed to plug in and give their bank codes. Many are taken in and scammed out of their hard-earned money. We need to do a lot more from a consumer protection point of view. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment needs to urge the Commission for Communications Regulation to be a little more proactive. One suggestion I have heard is that when someone rings an international or premium number, he or she should be alerted to the fact that he or she is ringing such a number before being connected. We need to send the message that phone scamming is a huge issue and make sure people are vigilant and aware of it. It is very easy to be a victim. Even the wiliest of people are falling victim to it. </p>
          <p eId="para_94"> The third item I wish to raise concerns home help hours. It is an issue I have raised in the house before. There are 6,200 older people across the country waiting urgently for a home help. In certain parts of the country, including County Kerry, north Cork, Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary, no one is waiting and it is very easy to receive support. However, in Galway, north County Dublin and other parts of the country there are long waiting lists. In Galway alone there are 674 people waiting. This clearly shows that there is a disparity. Where someone is living is a factor in whether he or she will have the home help he or she needs. It has been described as a postcode lottery. Everyone throughout the country should receive the same service, no matter where he or she lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">I do not think it is fair that people who live in a certain area get a better service and more home help hours. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to address this matter, on which I look forward to having a debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">For the first time, yesterday evening we saw the proposed Brexit deal between the EU and the British Government. Sinn Féin rightly highlighted the danger posed to this tentative deal by the extreme Brexiteers in the Tory party and the DUP. I acknowledge that the deal agreed by the British Cabinet yesterday is one that mitigates against the worst aspects of Brexit but there are other issues to be ironed out and matters that need to be clarified. We will all be busy this weekend with the 500 plus pages examining the detail of the deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> Some of the issues can be addressed by the Government, and also by the Oireachtas, in particular issues relating to rights and representation. Some of those concerns were raised with the Government this morning by my party vice president, Michelle O'Neill, who was part of a delegation of parties representing the pro-remain majority in the North. The four parties the Taoiseach met this morning represent the majority view of citizens in the North. The DUP does not, and that is a fact. DUP representatives have been using the most incendiary, rash and ostentatious rhetoric in the past 48 hours, but ordinary citizens in the North, whether republican, nationalist, unionist or otherwise, recognise that Brexit is not good and they want a deal that protects their livelihood and future. Sinn Féin speaks for all of the communities on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Prime Minister May said the advice of the British Attorney General in respect of the withdrawal agreement would be made available to the House of Commons today. I presume the Government will also have legal advice, whether from the European Commission or the Attorney General. That should be made available in order that we can get the fullest picture possible of what is on the table. I very much look forward to having a debate in this House with the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, and going through some more of the detail as it emerges.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> I acknowledge all of those who have been involved in the deal to date given that it appears to have protected the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement, and the work done by the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, with our representatives. From day one we said there needed to be special status for the North within the EU. Let us work together to do everything we possibly can to make it happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">Unfortunately, not all have taken on the responsibilities and roles they should have played. I am sorry that did not happen because I would have liked to see all parties in this State work together for the best outcome for the Thirty-two Counties, and the best outcome for the UK and for Europe, but that has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I will briefly turn to one item that is within our control, namely, the housing crisis. In Ringsend there is a site called Poolbeg West, which has the potential to provide 3,500 units but it has been delayed over and over again. Negotiations remain to be concluded on the purchase of 900 units for social and affordable housing and, unfortunately, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has not played its part. There is no excuse for the Department not to play its part in the middle of a housing crisis. This is not a planning matter, it is a question of negotiations on the number of units to be purchased. That is delaying a decision of An Bord Pleanála. There is a written agreement for the strategic development zone, SDZ, in Dublin City Council and there is a commercial agreement in regard to it. When he was Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, called it a gentlemen's agreement. He promised us we would see cranes and JCBs on the site in 2017 but there has not been any progress. It is a crying shame and a resolution is urgently needed. Could the Leader arrange that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, would attend and explain the lack of movement in the provision of 3,500 units? We hear over and over that there is a supply issue but here is an opportunity to create supply. I will respect the Chair and finish on this point, which unfortunately the Minister did not do yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">I make these remarks today as a Border representative, as somebody from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, who lives close to the Border where we have many ties of kinship north of the Border. I wish to publicly appeal through this House to our Northern friends right across the divide, who are hard-headed, shrewd business people with a particular business culture, to look twice at this agreement before they decide to reject it. I ask them to look at the fact that their constitutional position is not threatened. There is no threat to the integrity of the constitutional position of Northern Ireland. There is a legal acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement, which ultimately means there must be a popular mandate to undo the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> First, there is no threat. Nothing changes there and nothing will change there. Second, the deal gives the people of Northern Ireland access to the EU and to every benefit the EU confers, bearing in mind that the North voted to remain. It gives them access to the customs union, to trade and to all the benefits. Third, it gives them unfettered access to UK markets in a post-Brexit situation. It would be an economic bonanza for Northern Ireland in that it would leave it the best of both worlds and put it into a solvent position. Our hard-headed and good friends in Ulster will have to look at this question. I sincerely appeal to them to do that. They should bear in mind that the alternative means an impoverishment of Ulster, which ultimately will impoverish the existing Northern Ireland State and will make its hinterland poor because it will lower people's capacity to buy, trade and do business with the Republic. That is a very serious implication also.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> My basic point is that people in Northern Ireland should look twice at the deal and consider accepting it. I appeal to all sides in Northern Ireland to get the Assembly up and running again because if there is anything that highlights that lacuna and the need for a domestic administration in Northern Ireland it is the current goings on.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The people of Northern Ireland should view this from the perspective of their own interests. They should realise there is no threat to their future and that this gives them the best of all worlds.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">We experienced euphoria last night on the announcement by Prime Minister, Theresa May, that a majority in her Cabinet backed the Brexit deal with the European Union. People were very happy with the deal and it is very satisfactory as far as Ireland and Britain are concerned. The UK got a tremendous deal. As I watched a live broadcast from the House of Commons this morning, it became clear that the situation is extremely grave. I could not be optimistic after watching and hearing the contributions and in light of the resignation of Dominic Raab, the Minister assigned to the negotiation of Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> That having been said, we should be calm in the approach we take and not claim too much credit for this outcome. We compliment Mr. Barnier representing the 27 member states and the negotiators from the United Kingdom. The solution, which I fully support, involves an agreement with the UK on Ireland, free trade, etc. I am afraid the position looks very serious at the moment. Unfortunately, when the Prime Minister attends the European Council meeting of Heads of State on 25 November, she may not have the support of the majority of the House of Commons. This will probably lead to her replacement, followed by a general election and the new British Government, whoever that will be, will be back to the drawing board. I hope the government returned to the British Parliament, whether led by the Labour Party or another party, will have a clear majority and will be in a position to negotiate. It is extraordinarily difficult for the Prime Minister to find that the level of disloyalty among Tory backbenchers and in her government makes her position practically untenable. I regret having to make that observation. As far as a I can see, a new referendum will not be held but there may be a change of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The question as to whether the seven Sinn Féin MPs take up their seats in the House of Commons is fairly irrelevant. </p>

          <p eId="para_136">To respond to the previous contribution, the Government, specifically the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, have been very low key about this, and purposely so, to allow room and space for those who have difficult decisions ahead of them. I welcome the British Cabinet's decision but I fully realise the difficulties that lie ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> I had a short meeting this morning with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and I am delighted that letters will issue to more than 79,000 pensioners to inform them that they will receive a correction to their income, which was adversely affected by changes in the 2012 Act. I have raised this issue numerous times and I welcome this development. There will also be back pay to March last.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> I raise another issue that I have also raised several times previously. It relates to rural planning and a ruling by the European Court of Justice that a local-only rule introduced in Flanders was illegal and no longer pertinent or allowed. I have called several times for the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to inform the House what his plans are for new directions and guidelines on this matter to be issued to local authorities. Many people who are in the middle of a planning application or have just been granted planning permission are wondering whether their permission will stand up to legal scrutiny. They are in a kind of limbo. Should they go ahead and buy a house? Will a bank give them a mortgage to build the house for which they have been granted permission? Others who wish to return to the rural areas from which they come to keep their communities vibrant are still being subjected to the locals-only rule, which has been found to be illegal by the European Court of Justice. I ask the Leader to call the Minister in to the House so that he can clarify the situation, outline his plans to correct this matter and give us the guidelines as soon as possible. People's lives are on hold in the middle of a housing crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I raise the decision to locate a direct provision centre in a hotel in Moville on the Inishowen Peninsula. This is one of the most northerly hotels in the entire island. The specific concern is that in recent days, the Irish Refugee Council has spoken out on this matter, pointing out that the refugees in question, some of whom are mothers with children, will be required to travel regularly to Dublin for a range of reasons. These include attending interviews with the International Protection Office and appeal hearings, renewing temporary residence certificates, meeting their lawyers and attending medical appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> As we know, adults in direct provision receive disposable income of €20 a week. How are they expected to travel from Moville on the Inishowen Peninsula? They will need to get a bus to Letterkenny, a connecting bus to Sligo and then a bus to Dublin. This must all be done in one day because there are issues around staying overnight. This is totally impractical and it shows once again the folly of this direct provision system. I have some knowledge of this because I chaired an Oireachtas committee that looked at direct provision for a sustained period. We visited centres and met families. These are people of many nationalities, languages and religions being located in rural areas. In this case, they will not be able to travel through the North because to do so would be a criminal offence. I have the privilege, as a citizen, of travelling from the Inishowen Peninsula through the Six Counties on my way to work. They will not have that privilege and will have to circumnavigate the land mass of the island. This is totally unacceptable and unfair to the refugees. This decision is also deeply unfair to the local community, with which there has been no consultation. We have 100 refugees moving to Moville in two weeks without community supports or additional resources being provided. The Minister stated on local radio that a friends of refugees group would be set up but no extra resources would be provided and no consultation has taken place. This is unfair to the local community and deeply unfair to the refugees and families who come here in the first place. Direct provision is a very bad system and it is getting worse. The all-party committee made recommendations and I have not seen any changes. The situation is getting worse.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">I am pleased that agreement has been reached between the EU and UK negotiators. We sought to protect the peace process and Good Friday Agreement and maintain the common travel area and related benefits for Irish and British citizens. We have to ensure that we are at the place in Europe where we can protect jobs and the economy. The Republic of Ireland did not vote for or want Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Theresa May has been true to her word. She has worked extremely hard to keep all of the factions together and I hope in the coming weeks and months that we will get an agreement. We are working in a committed way with the UK Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> My message to Ulster Unionists is that our approach was not in any way to threaten. It was merely to protect the Good Friday Agreement and everything that is included in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> I thank again all of the other political parties. Worked as a team in the interests of our country and our citizens, both here and in Europe. A bad deal for the United Kingdom was a bad deal for Ireland and we are in a much better space today.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Today is also the 33rd anniversary of the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which aimed to bring an end to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It gave the Irish Government an advisory role in Northern Ireland while confirming there would be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland unless the majority of the people agreed to join the Republic. It did improve co-operation between the British and Irish Governments which was a key creation of the Good Friday Agreement. That is something we have to acknowledge today. Thirty three years ago we did not have those relationships. Those relationships have been built up in the past 33 years and the Leas-Chathaoirleach would know that the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly has members from all parties and we have to ensure those relationships are improved and enhanced and worked upon because now we need them more than ever. Today is a good day. However, I think the coming weeks will tell how good it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">I take my lead from our leader, Senator Ardagh. The situation with Brexit is fraught at present and probably the less said the better. I agree with Senator Feighan that there has been a remarkable consensus of the main political parties in their approach to the important and sensitive issue, an issue which will define our time this term in the Seanad. I hope the Taoiseach will not regret his statement yesterday when he said that it was a good day to be in politics. I thought that was a bit previous and I thought it showed a little immaturity, which perhaps is a refreshing side of his nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> The whole focus is now on Westminster. We can look and observe and hope but with the exception of Sinn Féin there is nobody in Ireland in a position to do anything practical about it. I urge Sinn Féin to reconsider its position on Westminster. In fairness to Sinn Féin, it has come a long way. It has come into these Houses and taken part in parliamentary democracy. It refused to do that for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Sinn Féin now recognises the Garda force and that there is only one Army in the country. A bit of pragmatism would be a big help and those vital seven votes might be able to come into play. I would hate to see this deal being defeated by a margin of fewer than seven votes. There would be serious repercussions for the Sinn Féin Party if that were to occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> May I ask the Leas-Chathaoirleach whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, could be invited to the House at the earliest opportunity to discuss the situation in Aughinish Alumina on the Shannon Estuary. This is a significant employer, providing 480 jobs and is probably underpinning more than 2,000 support jobs. The main owner of the consortium that runs this project is a Russian oligarch, Mr. Oleg Deripaska. He is one of 24 people who was listed by the US as having interfered with their elections and is therefore blacklisted. There is a very serious threat hanging over imports of the products from Aughinish Alumina as long as he is a board member. Negotiations have been ongoing. The chairman of that group, Lord Barker of Battle, announced that the group was in serious negotiations for Mr. Deripaska to reduce his holding.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">However, it does mark a real achievement by the Irish Government and Irish negotiators and is a sign of the solidarity of the other member states of the EU who have stood by the principle of the backstop. The case for a people's vote on a second referendum in Britain has become much stronger because of the unlikelihood of this agreement passing. I echo the comments of my colleagues who have pointed out that it would be very helpful from an Irish perspective to have the Stormont institutions up and running and to have Sinn Féin members taking their seats in Westminster because that would enable a much stronger voice in terms of Irish interests to be heard in Britain. That is really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Let me raise the recent controversy around reports of proceedings in a rape trial that has been concluded. Without speaking in any way about the trial, may I bring it to the Leader's attention that Tom O'Malley, a leading expert from the National University of Ireland, Galway, is currently chairing a review commissioned by the Minister for Justice and Equality on practice and procedure in the trial of rape and sex offences. That review is due to conclude at the end of December.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I welcome the holding of a debate in the Seanad on the recommendations of that review because one of the considerations that I am sure the reviewers will take on board is the need to challenge sexist assumptions and stereotypes that still tend to be made in the conduct of rape trials and to ensure that our laws and practices do not support such stereotypes and such outdated views. That is an important point in the wake of that controversy.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">Today almost all Members will be talking about Brexit. I pay credit to Michel Barnier and his team, the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who was in the Seanad last week for statements on Brexit, the Taoiseach and the representatives of all the parties, including Deputies Michael Martin, Chambers and Donnelly from my party. Senator Ned O'Sullivan recently took over the foreign affairs brief in the Seanad but I am not sure how much credit I can give him for this one just yet. I am sure he will continue to play his role as did Senator Mark Daly before him.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> It is important that we pay credit for what has been achieved but acknowledge that, unfortunately, at this stage it is a draft text. It is a positive draft text from the Irish perspective, from the perspective of the Good Friday Agreement and the Border but there is a lot of work to do in Westminster before it goes anywhere, as Senator Ned O'Sullivan and others have pointed out. Ministers are resigning, including a junior Minister whom I have to confess I never heard of. That is my fault but I never heard of the junior Minister in the Northern Ireland Office who resigned this morning until he resigned. I am glad to see that my colleague who is much closer to the Border than I am had never heard of him either.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> There are definitely issues going on in Westminster. Theresa May has tried to square the circle as best she could. She has tried to bring it to a place that recognises Ireland, the Border and the Good Friday Agreement. I hope enough members of her party, and MPs generally, can see that the alternative to this agreement is either a no deal or as they say, "No Brexit". We might prefer a "No Brexit", but from the Brexiteers' point of view, they want something and from the Remainers' point of view, they want something. It is a compromise. There always will be compromise.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> It is probably the best deal that could be struck and I hope it gets through. I wish everybody well. The Leas-Chathaoirleach, I and others were in Westminster and Downing Street only last month. I think they do understand our position and have been listening to our position as has the EU. It is a credit to the Irish Civil Service. Mr. Rory Montgomery is in a very senior position but many people in that division have been, and are, working extremely hard. The Irish ambassador to the UK and the British ambassador to Ireland have been working to try to get a deal that satisfies Ireland as best they can. I pay tribute to those who have got this far and hope beyond hope. Perhaps I will light a candle and pray that we can get it across the line. The people in Westminster will appreciate that the deal is not perfect. It was never going to be perfect but it is probably the best that can be achieved to satisfy everybody's outcomes. I wish it well.</p>

          <p eId="para_163">Given the day that is in it I believe it is important that I should echo the comments made by several Members regarding the Brexit negotiations and where we have moved in recent weeks. Any Brexit is a bad Brexit for Ireland but the deal we managed to hammer out in the past six or eight months represents an important step forward. Yesterday was an important day for us as a State and as a society.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> I wish to pay tribute in particular to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, for their diligent work to ensure we got this far with the Brexit talks. It is a draft text but it is a significant draft text. It hits every core point that we looked for. It solves most of those issues. In fact, it solves all those issues. That is important. This was a complicated and important negotiation, probably the most important negotiation since we entered the European Union in 1973. We need to acknowledge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> It is important that we can, if possible, ensure the House of Commons can work to ensure this text gets passed at some stage. In that sense Sinn Féin has an important role to play. Sinn Féin members are elected to that Parliament and there is a duty and responsibility on them now, on a once-off occasion, do what they need to do to ensure this deal is safe. If they do not, they will erode the entire principle of what we are trying to do.</p>

We hear a good deal about the people's voice and the voice of the people. It is a kind of Hitlerian chant, but we know now that the people have changed their minds. The opinion polls show that utterly clearly. They have changed their minds. What is the voice of the people? The leavers – the Brexiteers – are afraid of the voice of the people. That is why they do not want a second referendum. I will say one thing: there is a second referendum coming. This is going to go down the drain. They are all going to vote against, and that is a bloody good thing. Let us have a second referendum. The tragedy is that we will have a much-weakened Britain as a member of the European Community.

          <p eId="para_209"> I wish to join colleagues in welcoming the publication of the draft agreement between Britain and the European Union published yesterday. On the face of it it appears to be, as my colleague, Senator O'Reilly, has already stated, good for the Six Counties of Ulster that are currently governed by the United Kingdom. I fully endorse what Senator O'Reilly has said 100%. As a result, that can only be good news for the Border communities, especially the areas of Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Leitrim and Louth that I come from.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Like Senators O'Reilly, Mac Lochlainn and others in the House, having been born and reared on the Border I have seen at first hand the decimation caused to the region during the 30-odd years of the Troubles and beforehand. I welcome the draft agreement and the proposals relating to the backstop. However, I hope that we will be given an opportunity to scrutinise in minute detail all 585 pages of the agreement. Rightly, we are concerned about the backstop and about having no physical border on this island again. However, I do not think we should take our eyes off what else is in the draft agreement. I wish to caution against making decisions until we have examined it fully. I know my colleague, Senator Ned O'Sullivan, spent all of last night reading all those pages and has some concerns that he will be raising at a later date.</p>

I hope that common sense prevails and that it does get through at the end of the day if it is as good as it appears to be. I have not read the entire document, although I intend doing so.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I concur with previous speakers on the draft agreement that was launched yesterday. It is fair that we acknowledge the input of everyone involved from all parties and none from an Irish perspective in reaching this point. Unfortunately, the story is far from over and it is a very fluid situation. I wonder where this draft agreement will go. If I was a betting person, I would not put too much money on the British Prime Minister lasting much longer. I hope I will be proved wrong but I have concerns in that regard. There is a long way to go before this is over. We will discuss this subject in the House for many months and possibly years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> My other point concerns apprenticeships, an issue on which I came across a report recently. Unfortunately, Ireland is bottom of the European league table when it comes to apprenticeships in terms of the scale and diversity of apprenticeships on offer. Apprenticeships have always been the Cinderella of careers, which is very unfortunate. If we look at the scale of our problem with apprenticeships and the work that needs to be done, we can see that the statistics for the 2017-18 academic year are stark and highlight the gravity of the task that lies ahead. The total number of people in apprenticeships in that year stood at 14,871. The figure for enrolment in third level public institutions in the same academic year was 235,644. That shows the difficult task ahead of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> I acknowledge the work that has been done on apprenticeships but, clearly, much more needs to be done. Female participation in apprenticeships last year was 2% compared with 50% in our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom. We need a large-scale public campaign to create awareness of apprenticeships. If I were seeking an ambassador or poster boy for apprenticeships for young people thinking about apprenticeships, I would look no further than Martin McVicar from Combilift in County Monaghan, where I live. If I mention Martin McVicar or Combilift, everyone knows who I am talking about. The Government could do worse than pick up the phone to Martin McVicar and ask him to be our ambassador or poster boy for apprenticeships. When we look at housing, we see the lack of skilled workers in construction. If we look at the hospitality sector, both hotels and restaurants, we see that much more needs to be done in this area. </p>

          <p eId="para_220">One chairperson is enough. I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to speak. My point is very simple and I will not delay the House. I have looked at the figures for broadband and spoken to a couple of people working at a high level in the telecommunications industry. Eir has the infrastructure in place and still owns and controls all the telegraph poles and the underground cabling and ducting laid the length and breadth of the country. The company has been bought and sold several times through various vehicles and the main shareholder is Mr. Xavier Niel, who is based in Paris. The prudent approach to the long-awaited roll-out of broadband would be to repurchase Eir. The company is valued at approximately €3 billion. Given some of the figures mentioned in connection with the roll-out of broadband, engaging with the owner of Eir would be well worth considering.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I thank the 16 Members who contributed to the Order of Business. Fourteen speakers mentioned Brexit, the most significant political issue of our time. As Senator Ned O'Sullivan correctly stated, it will be the defining moment of this Oireachtas. To update the House, it is my intention to have a debate on the Brexit deal next Thursday. I repeat that we will discuss the deal next Thursday, in case Senator Norris missed it the first time.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">The Taoiseach spoke to Prime Minister May this morning and offered his support. The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach are committed, on behalf of both Governments, to working on the future EU-UK relationship and the Irish-UK relationship to ensure the backstop is never invoked. Despite some of the commentary and mean-spirited remarks made by some people, not necessarily in this House this morning, yesterday was a very good day for Ireland. It showed that the policy pursued at the beginning by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, and the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, was the correct one. It also showed that Michel Barnier is a man of his word and that he stuck with Ireland, as did the 26 other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> I want to make clear that the objective of the Government remains the protection of the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland. That objective was achieved yesterday. Whether we engage in partisan politics or not is immaterial. That was the Government's aim and I commend the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, along with our diplomats, on their tremendous work on behalf of the Irish people. I commend all parties for their consensus approach in wearing the green jersey.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Some Members' contributions this morning may have irked Senator Mac Lochlainn but we must remember that we are talking about the island of Ireland. We should all read Stephen Collins's article in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, which looked at Michael Collins and the treaty and the present-day analogy with Theresa May. All of us, North, South, east and west, have a duty to represent people and be responsible. With responsibility comes a requirement to make decisions. I encourage members of Sinn Féin to reflect on their responsibility with regard to the re-establishment of devolved government in Stormont and in the context of Brexit. This is not an unreasonable request given the precarious position in Westminster where we see the resignation of a minister or junior minister almost by the hour. </p>
          <p eId="para_226"> The focus today is on Westminster, as is appropriate, after which it will shift to 25 November and whether the agreement is passed in Westminster. I hope people will reflect politically on what this is about. There is no good Brexit deal for Ireland or the UK. Like Senator Norris, I hope there will be a second vote because the debate would then take place against the backdrop of the past two years, which have been chaotic and shambolic. A new referendum would be based on a more informed and honest debate, unlike the earlier one when people were duped. </p>
          <p eId="para_227">The DUP should reflect on its position. What was achieved yesterday secures and cements the future of Northern Ireland, the North of our country, from an economic point of view and regarding further sovereignty. They must reflect on that because it avoids the hard border which they do not want. We should all look at this morning's words, not invoking the backstop. We will have a debate in the House next Thursday.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> Senator Ardagh raised the issue of scam or bogus calls. ComReg has asked people to be vigilant. I know many of us have been in contact with Eir, whose department of fraud has been investigating these calls. I agree with Senator Ardagh that there is a need for some type of safeguarding of people, whether it is through protection of data, mobile phone numbers or landline numbers. It is something that we need to pursue.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> Senator Ardagh also raised the issue of home help hours. I draw her attention to the fact that in the budget announced last month, we saw home care supports grow from a base of €305 million in 2015 to €420 million today. That is 17 million home support hours being delivered to 50,500 people who are then able to live in their homes. I have always made the point and will again that we should review what home help hours are and what type of work is being carried out during them. We all support an increase in them. The Government is committed to having more people stay at home for longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> I would be happy to accept the amendment to the Order of Business from Senator Humphreys regarding No. 14. I am not familiar with the Ringsend issue that Senator Humphreys raised. He might receive a quicker response through a Commencement matter. We have requested the Minister to come to the House to debate it in the coming weeks, so perhaps the Senator can raise it then.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Senator Mac Lochlainn raised the issue of the direct provision centre in Moville in County Donegal. I am not familiar with the situation the Senator is discussing. We had a debate about direct provision on the Order of Business yesterday, when it was raised by Senator Warfield. We have seen positive changes on foot of the McMahon report. We would all like to see the issue of direct provision addressed expeditiously. There have been changes to waiting times. There is a single application. I am not familiar with the issue Senator Mac Lochlainn raised because I am not involved in that area. I am not trying to give the Senator a soft answer but perhaps he will request a Commencement matter debate. If he wants, I will certainly ask the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Senator Feighan raised the issue of the 33rd anniversary of the Anglo-Irish agreement. I pay tribute to our iar-Thaoiseach and iar-Airí Gnóthaí Eachtracha, Garret FitzGerald, Peter Barry and Dick Spring, who is still alive, for their tremendous work on that important day in the history of our country. It was a stepping stone on the bridge. To be fair to both Dick Spring and Albert Reynolds, they used that as the building bridge again later on. I want to remember Garret FitzGerald and Peter Barry today and thank them for their patriotic service to our company.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Senator Ned O'Sullivan raised the issue of Aughinish Alumina. Someone raised the issue before of a member of the board being involved in the blacklist of the American state department. I will be happy to try to have the Minister come to the House again to discuss the matter. It is an important industry which provides employment in a significant part of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Senator Bacik raised the matter of the trial, which we discussed yesterday. We all condemn the treatment of the victim. It is hard enough to come forward. We must support and encourage any victim of domestic violence or rape to come forward and give them the full support of the State. I welcome that the O'Malley review will be completed, it is hoped, by the end of December or early January. I give a commitment now that we will have that debate in the House in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> When Senator Norris came to speak to me, I thought he had said to me that we were not to conclude at 5 o'clock. Two schedules were issued, one for Members on Thursday afternoon last week and we issued another schedule during the week. To be fair, we have had over 41 hours of debate on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and we cannot delay it any further. I do not wish to discommode any Member of the House but if we are going to have a variety of reasons to put off debate, we might as well not sit and just stay at home.</p>

I remind the Senator that the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, and the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, introduced a whole new range of apprenticeships. The Senator is quite correct that we are quite low on the league table of apprenticeships compared with, for example, Germany, which has 40%. In contrast, 60% of people here go into higher education and we must correct that imbalance. It is to be welcomed that we saw a 25% increase in people taking up apprenticeships last year. I will certainly ask the Minister to come to the House to outline the way in which the €122 million is spent on apprenticeships. I do not want to divide the House and hope Senator Norris will not press the amendment on the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.</p>

I will just finish commenting on the amendments from the point at which I was stopped. We were discussing amendments Nos. 7 to 16, inclusive, and I had dealt with those as far as No. 15.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> Amendment No. 16 inserts a criminal penalty for those who break regulations issued in the interests of the welfare of racing greyhounds under section 29. A criminal penalty is retained for cases where regulations under section 26, which relates to the artificial insemination of greyhounds, are broken. Someone who violates the health and welfare regulations, however, is only subject to a racing penalty. We seek to strengthen this section of the Bill by giving real teeth to the regulations and to make the Bill more uniform.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> Amendments Nos. 7 to 16, inclusive, taken together are intended to strengthen and work with the provisions of the Bill as written and as they relate to the welfare of greyhounds.

          <p eId="para_262">I welcome the Minister of State back again. I support the amendment, which I think is important. There were a number of grouped amendments but I refer to amendment No. 7, which impels the board to ensure that this issue is dealt with rather than allowing it to deal with the issue casually or selectively. The reputational damage of the drugs issue in the greyhound industry has gone worldwide. It has been written about as far away as Australia and the US. It needs to be tidied up. That is why I support this amendment. The board has an obligation to bring the highest levels of integrity back into the Irish greyhound industry. Its reputation has been tarnished with all sorts of issues around drugs. There are other issues but the drugs issue in particular has tarnished the industry's reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> This is a wonderful industry. There are many people who have dogs, who breed dogs and who race dogs but, unfortunately, the introduction of drugs into the sport has created an elite tier within the greyhound industry. This means that the prize money is very often beyond the reach of the ordinary owners and breeders. That may or may not be true, but it is certainly the perception among grassroots owners and breeders. While that perception remains, there will be no incentive for people to stay in the industry or for new or young people to enter into the sector. That needs to be dealt with and that is why I support the amendment. We are all on the one page here. We are trying to strengthen and protect the industry and to make sure that its integrity is improved. Making sure that this legislation is as strong as possible only helps that. That is what Senator Ruane is trying to do here and that is why I support it.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_264">I thank Senators Ruane and Ó Domhnaill for the amendments. I hope it was helpful to have time outside of the Chamber to discuss some of the concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> I propose to address amendments Nos. 7 to 16, inclusive, together. With regard to amendments Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, 11 to 13, inclusive, and 15, I am opposed in principle to compelling Rásaíocht Con Éireann to make regulations. The provisions set out here are enabling provisions, not all of which may be required to be made at this time. By necessity this is an exhaustive list of the principles and policies for which Rásaíocht Con Éireann may wish to regulate. It was never intended that Rásaíocht Con Éireann would necessarily make regulations in respect of all of these provisions in the immediate future, but rather that these provisions would future-proof the legislation so that, should it become necessary or desirable to regulate those matters in future, Rásaíocht Con Éireann would have the power to do so. Different policy considerations may arise with regard to whether such legislation is necessary or desirable in the future. In particular, regulations would also have to be examined to determine their compatibility with other domestic and European law. The discretionary nature of the regulation-making power is essential to ensure there is no conflict with other legislation. For these reasons it would clearly not be appropriate to impose an obligation on Rásaíocht Con Éireann to make regulations in respect of all of the matters set out in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> With particular reference to the proposed section 29(1)(e), which makes provision for the health and welfare of racing greyhounds that have been retired by the owner, we discussed the issue of retirement provisions with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The advice received was that the term "retirement" was subjective and that it would not be possible therefore to regulate or enforce this provision. The point was made that the difference between a retired greyhound and a greyhound that is not racing at present is unclear. This matter can best be dealt with through the addition of specific guidelines on retirement in the board's existing code of practice for the welfare of greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Amendment No. 10<i>a</i> obliges the owner, breeder and trainer of a greyhound to provide details of the keeper of a greyhound to the board. The previous wording only obliged the owner to provide this information. The purpose of this amendment is to enhance traceability further. I am addressing the purpose of amendment No. 14 through an amendment of my own, No. 13<i>a</i>. I believe my amendment addresses Senator Ruane's concerns. The new wording makes it clear that the owner, breeder or trainer of a racing greyhound must comply with regulations made by the board for the protection of the health and welfare of the greyhound and requires that the owner, breeder or trainer inform the board of the measures being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> With regard to amendment No. 16, animal health and welfare is governed by the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. This Act imposes criminal penalties for breaches of animal welfare requirements. The purpose of section 29 of this Bill is to provide for Rásaíocht Con Éireann to regulate welfare in accordance with its own system of administrative sanctions in the limited and specific circumstances in which it may be appropriate to do so, having regard to the extensive powers already granted to the Minister and his authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. Such regulations will accordingly require careful consideration. When examining the draft legislation it is very easy to lose sight of the bigger picture while involved in the detail of the Bill. It is important to recall that the rules established under the 2013 Act apply to greyhounds as well as other animals. Thus the prohibition on causing unnecessary suffering to an animal applies to greyhounds, as does the requirement not to be neglectful or to disregard recklessly the health or welfare of a greyhound. As I have stated, the 2013 Act imposes criminal penalties for breaches of animal welfare requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Transforming the provisions of the Bill into criminal provisions would conflict with the 2013 Act and remove the ability of the board to impose administrative sanctions in an efficient and timely manner in accordance with its own legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_270">I am happy to accept amendment No. 13<i>a</i> which fixes the grammatical error I sought to correct with amendment No. 14 in my name. I thank the Minister of State for engaging on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> I wish to discuss a couple of other issues. I completely accept and understand the idea that a racing sanction is an appropriate response in the case of someone who breaks the regulations that protect the health and welfare of greyhounds. I would have been happy to pull back on amendment No. 16 but not on the basis that might still in place in the context of the health and welfare of animals. Section 29 deals with the health and welfare of greyhounds. The section is much shorter than the others and does not impose an unfair regulatory burden on the Irish Greyhound Board. Amendments Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, simply seek to raise the obligations of the board and strengthen the animal welfare provisions. I do not see the board as having any real teeth in terms of sanctions when obligations related to animal health and welfare are deemed to be optional in using the word "may". As to whether the provision is included in the other Acts - section 29 deals with the health and welfare of greyhounds - inserting the word "may" means that one can choose to meet the requirements stipulated in the Bill. To provide for the imposition of race sanctions on such grounds one would have to strengthen the legislation by inserting the word "shall" in order that a person would be obliged to meet the requirement of the health and welfare regulations stipulated in the Bill. Other than that there is not much the board can do in terms of the imposition of race sanctions. </p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Section 26 deals with the artificial insemination of greyhounds, while section 28 provides for the establishment of a traceability database for greyhounds. I accept that the regulatory powers given to the board in sections 26 and 28 are intended to enable it to provide an exhaustive list that will give it discretion and flexibility in terms of where it can and should regulate. I do not see it as being the same in the case of section 29. The use of the word "may" dilutes the legislation. Therefore, I am unwilling to back down in my call for the replacement of the word "may" with "shall" as the provision relates to the health and welfare of greyhounds.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">Yes. I will table a number of additional amendments on Report Stage to deal with the artificial insemination of greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> The Irish Greyhound Board received a legal opinion from Mr. Ross Aylward, senior counsel, on 27 February 2013. His legal opinion was sought on the use of frozen semen in the sector. It reads as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_277">There is no escaping the need to apply the two year death limit in my view. To fail to do so is only to perpetuate an already existing problem. In essence the bord finds itself where it does. The damage has been done in that the two year limit has not been complied with. Nothing can be done now, in terms of turning back the clock on the issue (one cannot go back retrospectively). However the bord can now seek to ensure that the AI regulations are complied with.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">New regulations were subsequently introduced in 2014, under the stewardship of the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney. It meant that the two-year death limit was no longer applied retrospectively. Let me outline the current system. The Irish Greyhound Board approves a number of licences which it issues to studkeepers who provide an artificial insemination service for greyhounds. The two-year death limit means that no frozen semen from a dog that is dead can be used. If the board had implemented the regulations, as it should have done because it was the law, there would be no greyhound racing on any track today bred with the semen of a dog which was dead. What is actually happening is that board is continuing to flout its own regulations which conveys a misconception and creates a two tier playing field in the sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_279"> The current chairman of the Irish Greyhound Board appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on 18 May 2017 when a member of the committee, Deputy Connolly, asked him why it had not complied with its own regulations. He confirmed that she was correct and had to admit that it was not complying with them. Nothing has changed since. Compliance with the regulations is one of the key recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in its report. In fact, it recommended that the issue be addressed immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> As far back as 14 July 2015, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, state in reply to a parliamentary question tabled for a written reply: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_281">Following that consultation and with my consent, as is required under section 39 of the 1958 Act, the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds (Amendment) Regulations 2014 were introduced by BnG and came into effect on 1 November 2014, thus removing the two-year time limit on the use of semen for artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog. These regulations did not have retrospective effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The reply means that no dog should be racing today, the mother of which received semen from a dog that had died many years prior to that date, but, unfortunately, that is not the case. I have been told that last Saturday night dogs raced in stadiums under the jurisdiction of the Irish Greyhound Board, in respect of which the regulations had been flouted. How can that be considered to be a level playing field? Such a situation is unacceptable, which is why Senator Ruane's amendment is so important. This week I wrote to the board asking it to explain the matter. I understand the board has issued licences to five studs that provide frozen semen, for which individuals pay anything between €700 and €7,000. Recently, a greyhound by the name of Trade Official participated in a race.</p>

          <p eId="para_285">That dog is dead; therefore, the regulations have been flouted.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">How can anyone have confidence in an organisation that flouts its own regulations? The five licensed operators are turning themselves into multimillionaires by creating a cartel within the sector. There is no level playing field, but we do not have to recreate the moon to deal with this issue. All we have to do is replicate what is occurring in the horse racing sector which does not use frozen semen. The frozen semen being used deters ordinary, hardworking people who may have a number of dogs from staying in or getting back into the sector because they do not have the financial means of those who can avail of frozen semen from top dogs that are dead.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> There are allegations, some of which were outlined by a whistleblower to a former Minister at the Department in 2013, including that a lot of drug money is involved in the sector. That is very serious and I question the integrity of the entire sector. I call on the Minister to either accept the amendment or reflect on it before Report Stage because it is an issue which I believe, based on information I am not at liberty to disclose today, will blow up badly. Some of the information I have obtained is private and I have to ensure the authenticity and truthfulness of other bits of it, but if what I am hearing is correct, we will be dealing with a huge problem, with operators sitting on piles of frozen semen worth millions of euro and holding up implementation of this rule. Why is the Irish Greyhound Board sitting on the matter and why are its directors not dealing with it? I suggest it has to do with money and vested interests. If that is the case, it is disgraceful and needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> I am not sure if the Minister has the information today on the licensing regime, the licences being given out or why the regulations continue to be flouted, but does he agree with me that there is a need to address this issue to protect the interests of the taxpayer, the State, the Department and everyone concerned? We need to make sure the industry will not run aground in the next few years. The answer may be a replication of what the horse racing and thoroughbred sector does in the area of artificial insemination, particularly in the use of frozen semen. I encourage the Minister to seek a legal opinion on the matter. The issue needs to be addressed because we cannot allow a cartel to operate within the sector which is heavily funded with moneys from the Minister's Department by way of the betting tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> I thank the Minister for his work on the Bill and meeting me and colleagues on an individual basis to discuss it. It is very much appreciated that he has reached out to us in that way. I wanted to express my thoughts in the light of the information brought to my attention and my fears about the integrity of the industry, given the infiltration of money from questionable sources which continue to dominate the industry, creating a huge problem for regular greyhound owners who want to compete in it. The only way to deal with the issue is to ensure this legislation is watertight. Therefore, we should not rush it. I commend Senator Ruane on her efforts. Legislation is often rushed through without being scrutinised properly, but as changing the word "may" to "shall" could have a huge impact, I hope the amendment will be accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_290">I will speak briefly to amendment No. 15 which seeks to place responsibility on the Irish Greyhound Board to develop and publish industry-wide guidelines on how dogs should be dealt with by their owners when retired from racing. As the Minister suggested the possibility of including it elsewhere, perhaps in guidelines, he might get back to me to explain what he means. There was some confusion on the question of what is retirement. Perhaps we might look at how it is defined before Report Stage. There must be a difference between a dog which is not racing and one which has officially been retired from racing; therefore, it should not be difficult to define. Perhaps they could be seen as having been retired when they no longer have a licence to race or when the owner sees no future in racing for them because of age or an injury. There has to be some way by which we can look at what retirement means in order that we can include amendment No. 15 in the legislation as a preventive measure to ensure people will think about what they are going to do with their dogs when they are retired. The legislation is strong on this issue, but it would be useful to define what is meant.</p>

          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_291">I am happy to co-sign the amendments. On traceability and registration, the substitution of the word "shall" is important because we cannot have an industry in which such things "may" be introduced. Section 28(2) also contains the word "may" where I believe "shall" should be used. I reserve the right, therefore, to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to copperfasten that provision, particularly if we do not see progress in the use of the word "shall" in subsection (1). It is important that there be transparency, traceability and accountability in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I wish to speak to section 29 which deals with the welfare of racing greyhounds and the amendments proposed to it. I urge the Minister to engage on what are very reasoned amendments. The State simply could not stand over a situation where there was no provision or guidelines on ensuring the health and welfare of racing greyhounds. Persons involved in greyhound racing are only required to provide information for the purposes of the administration of the industry or protecting the health and welfare of a racing greyhound. We have talked about the use of the word "shall" instead of "may", but the use of the word "or" is worse. I understand the amendment in that regard is being accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> I also want to speak to amendment No. 15 which would ensure provision was made for protecting the health and welfare of racing greyhounds which have been retired by their owner. My colleague has spoken about how we determine what retirement is, but I argue that it is not crucial to determine what it is. The key point is that responsibility rests with an owner during the lifetime of a greyhound. The amendment states the health and welfare of the racing greyhound are the responsibility of the owner in the time in which he or she owns the greyhound.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">That is important because it is not the case that greyhounds can seek other employment. As the Minister of State said, they may well continue to give monetary benefit as breeding stock, but we must not have a situation where greyhounds are no longer of any concern and do not need to be attended to when they are no longer working. We should not mire ourselves in the technicalities, but rather ensure we have phrasing that is clear. While I do not like to use such blunt terms as those used in trade, we can look to the EU guidance on life-cycle planning and costing. I do not like to think of greyhounds as a product because they are fellow creatures, but life-cycle planning is now recognised as a key aspect of all industries. It is important that those who wish to ensure they are dealing with participants in the greyhound industry who have ethical practices can be assured that this ethical practice extends beyond the working lifetime of a dog. I would like the Minister of State to indicate that he will work with us to ensure the welfare of the animals is given due regard and guidance is provided for when they are no longer racing or working. This is a humane and appropriate thing to do in animal welfare terms and it sends an important signal. Importantly, it also ensures that those in the industry who engage in good practice and make provision for greyhounds when they are no longer racing are not punished. There is a cost to maintaining welfare. It is important that this is recognised and rewarded rather than giving those who cut corners and compromise the health and welfare of dogs an unfair advantage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_295">I thank the Cathaoirleach and Senators. To clarify the position for Senator Higgins, I have dealt with amendment No. 14. I note that, as currently drafted, section 29 states: "The Board, after consultation with the Minister, may make regulations for the health and welfare of racing greyhounds in relation to the following". I tried to explain that the word "may" is used specifically for greyhounds. This is additional to provisions in other legislation, particularly the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011. The risk of making this mandatory is that it may conflict with other legislation. As I stated, regulations would also have to be examined to determine their compatibility with other domestic and European law. The discretionary nature of regulation making powers is essential to ensure there is no conflict with other legislation. This is an extra layer of protection for animals that are racing.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> With regard to the retirement of animals, I note that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 deals with all animals. Whether they are racing, retired, injured or have diseases, all animals are covered. The Bill specifically mentions injured or sick animals - the word "disease" is used - on the presumption that these animals may race again. They are, therefore, covered. I have suggested that we add to the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 the board's specific welfare guidelines with regard to animals that are no longer racing. The Act already includes an extensive list of guidelines, which the board issued to owners and carers of greyhounds. There are several Acts and codes of practice that govern this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> With regard to artificial insemination, I know some amendments will probably be moved on Report Stage. I note that the erstwhile regulations on frozen semen were repealed, for reasons we will not get into today because I am not fully clear on all of the facts. A complete blanket ban on frozen semen without codes of practice or regulation might be unwise from the point of view of genetic improvement. There may be areas of concern and I agree that this area needs to be carefully policed and monitored to ensure full transparency and accountability. While we can look at that issue, section 26(1)(<i>m</i>) already makes provision for control or prohibition of the use of frozen semen from deceased animals. </p>
          <p eId="para_298"> I believe Senator Ruane asked a question on amendment No. 16.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">I addressed that issue. To return to section 29, we should be wary in this regard because these provisions provide an extra layer of protection for racing animals that is intended to bolster rather than conflict with existing legislation. That is the important point. Sanctions can be applied under these provisions, as opposed to taking action through the criminal law, as provided for in other legislation. By having it this way, we can apply sanctions without conflicting with existing law. This can be done immediately and efficiently, whereas taking the criminal law route can be laborious and not as effective in the short term. </p>

          <p eId="para_301">I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement. In regard to section 29, I suggest that there are other ways. In this House we often deal with legislation which intersects with or is layered on top of other legislation. There is still scope to use the word "shall" in section 29, for example, by amending the wording to "shall make appropriate regulation". That might be a way to do it. I acknowledge that the regulations should not contradict other existing legislation, but that is part of the task of making legislation rather than a reason to make regulation optional. We can establish that we should make regulation, and it does not in any way endanger other measures. The process of making those regulations should seek to accommodate and recognise other intersecting legislation. With respect, I suggest that the Minister of State's argument relates to how regulations are made rather than the question of whether they should be made. Perhaps the way to accommodate the concerns raised by the Minister of State would be to insert the phrase "such as appropriate" in the context of the regulations as this might allow sufficient scope to be flexible.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> It is not adequate to deal with the question of retired dogs through the existing legislation. Consider the provision and planning made for any one of us who is working. The arrangements we have with our employers for our retirement are made during the period when we are working. It is important that provision for retirement is built into the planning of the working period. To simply say that a dog that is no longer working takes on some other capacity, like a pet, and is dealt with under general animal welfare regulation is much weaker. As the Minister of State stated, pursuing such matter through the criminal courts is extremely laborious and unlikely. It is very important that the animals at the core of the greyhound industry are given protection in its business planning. This legislation effectively relates to the planning and administration of the industry and concerns the dogs when they are working. As I mentioned, life-cycle planning and thinking is now a core requirement of all industries. It is completely reasonable for the board, which sets regulations for the industry, to also set regulations on making provision for the retirement of the animals that are at its heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">This is the appropriate place, with the protection of those significant sanctions, for this rather than simply moving greyhounds into the wider pool of general animal welfare legislation. Perhaps the Minister of State could review this between Committee and Report Stages and see if there is a form of words that would allow for the health and welfare - or even the planning for the health and welfare - of greyhounds in retirement to be included in this Bill? </p>

          <p eId="para_305">I am still not sold on the reasons for not being able to accept "shall" in section 29. On the other legislation, am I right in saying that is where criminal sanctions would set in? Is it grounded in criminal sanctions? This is about the board. It is stated that "the board, after consultation with the Minister, may make regulations". If the board does not make the regulations, what is the point of having this section here at all? It should state that "the board, after consultation with the Minister, shall make regulations". How is the board given any power to issue racing sanctions when the welfare issues are being made optional?</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> The Minister of State stated that welfare and other legislation exists. That means that if somebody broke any regulation that exists in other legislation, such as that protecting the health and welfare of a racing greyhound, he or she would then automatically be dealt with criminally. Unless the board is given power by stating that it "shall" make the regulations, it does not have any power in this section to give racing sanctions. Any breaking of regulations would automatically fall under criminal grounds because the Minister of State is stating that it is picked up in the other legislation. It therefore weakens the board. The board will only be strengthened if it can make and create the regulations. It must be able to hold people accountable under the regulations and issue racing sanctions so any infractions do not have to be escalated criminally. These things must be able to be dealt with at board level. </p>
          <p eId="para_307"> As it stands, however, if I was to break any of these rules, as somebody who raced greyhounds, I would refer to this legislation and point out that it states that the board "may" make regulations. I would then ask what are the regulations and where they are. I would also point out that there is nothing stating I have to adhere to the regulations. The Minister of State is weakening the legislation and the board's ability to keep it at a racing sanction level by not introducing "shall". I do not see the rationale. </p>

          <p eId="para_308">I know these are sincerely held views and I hope Senator Ruane can accept we are trying to make this legislation work. That is the bottom line. This is for racing greyhounds so that there can be sanctions in the same way as with breaches in other areas. We have gone through this list of breaches, whether on traceability or anything else. Sections 26, 27 and 28 deal extensively with the various aspects such as administrative substances, artificial insemination, traceability and database transfer. We are being consistent here and ensuring any regulations made can achieve the desired effect by being consistent with existing legislation. I do not know that it is relevant. The aim of this section of the Bill is to impose racing sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> These regulations need to be compatible and state that they are health and welfare regulations for racing animals. We need to be able to apply sanctions consistent with breaches of other legislation where a different sort of penalty applies. The board may not end up having to apply regulations in every aspect of the exhaustive list that we dealt with earlier. It may or may not be necessary but it has to be compatible. We have come to an impasse here. On retired animals, it is important to point out this deals with racing animals. Retired animals may no longer be in the possession of the owner or trainer that was racing them. They are, however, certainly still protected under animal health and welfare legislation, the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and the code of guidelines administrated by the Irish Greyhound Board, or Rásaíocht Con Éireann if this legislation is passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">As I referred to earlier, I hope we will have an opportunity to look at this again between now and Report Stage. I hear what the Minister of State is saying about the importance of things being compatible with and in appropriate relationship with other legislation. This issue appears throughout the Bill. In a spirit of constructive engagement, I suggest that where the word "shall" appears, for example in "the board shall make regulations" and in the various places already suggested, we add "appropriate" so that it reads the "board shall make appropriate regulations". I may suggest this on Report Stage. I refer to a definition of "appropriate regulations" which also stated such regulations must be consistent with other indicated legislation. At the moment it is either that there will or will not be regulation. That is the issue I am trying to get to.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I recognise the concerns that there cannot be contradiction with other provisions already there. They need to be complimentary. Perhaps a definition of "appropriate regulation" which copperfastened that would allow us to move forward to a position of stating "shall". That would ensure we do not have a situation where the board simply chooses not to make regulations in all of these areas and much of the Bill effectively becomes redundant. </p>
          <p eId="para_312"> The important thing is that this Bill is designed to introduce something that can work. If we want it to work, regulations will have to come into existence so the sanctions can come into existence. I want to make sure that engine of momentum is in the Bill and followed through. I refer to moving towards the word using the word "shall" but with an important caveat in respect of what is appropriate regulation. That may address the concerns raised by the Minister of State. Perhaps we could look at that. I reserve the right to introduce amendments to that effect on Report Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The Minister of State mentioned that greyhounds may no longer be in the possession of their owners or trainers. That is one of the concerns we have. I refer to where dogs that have served in this industry are sometimes abandoned, have moved out of the industry and are left in dire situations. I refer to the phrasing here in respect of making provision for the retirement of greyhounds. The retirement provisions for greyhounds should known so that people in the greyhound racing industry can operate in good faith and with good practice. They should also be known to somebody wishing to sell a dog. People may not maintain possession of a dog for their lifetime but it would be appropriate and good practice for them to make appropriate provision for its retirement. That might be wording we could look at and I reserve the right to bring that in on Report Stage. </p>

          <p eId="para_315">If we look at section 29(2) it states: "A person who contravenes a regulation made under this section, and which is stated in the regulations to be a racing sanction provision, commits a sanction breach of the Racing code and is liable to a racing sanction." It is important to point out that this carries a lower burden of proof than an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013. I also refer to my own amendment, which is an attempt to tidy up what was poorly phrased.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">There are requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b), as outlined in the amendment, that I think will be agreed, for measures to be taken by the owner, breeder or trainer of a racing greyhound to protect the health and welfare of the greyhound and to inform the board of measures taken in respect of a greyhound to comply with the requirements of regulations made under this section. It is assumed there that regulations will be made. I take the Senator's point about using a word such as "appropriate", but the "may" allows discretion to make sure that the regulations are compatible and that they do not impose a higher burden of proof for a sanction breach as opposed to a criminal breach, if that makes sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> I have to stick to this. In making our amendment I have tried to address the fundamental issue, and when it is read with section 29(2), I am sure the Senator can grasp the dilemma that we are in insofar as we are trying to make sure that we can apply a sanction without having to prove it to the degree that we would have to prove a criminal offence, if that makes sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_319">Amendments Nos. 8a, 8c and 8e are to correct errors of a typographical or technical nature in particular. Amendment 8e corrects the original wording which suggested that the control committee had discretion in deciding the period during which a greyhound may not race following an adverse analytical finding and subsequent clear test. In fact, the period is decided by the board based on the recommendations of the scientific advisory committee for a particular substance type. The restriction on racing applies automatically following an adverse analytical finding and subsequent clear test where the substance is deemed still to have a residual performance effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> On Senator Ó Domhnaill's amendment No. 8b on zero tolerance for class A drugs, studies show that it is an unfortunate feature of modern society that drugs are now considered an environmental contaminant. The sensitivity of testing is such that were a sample to be taken from a banknote in our pockets, we would all fail to meet the zero tolerance limit being advocated by the Senator. An academic study carried out at Dublin City University found that every banknote tested was contaminated by traces of cocaine.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Environmental contamination of dogs can occur unintentionally and will be detected. Modern analytical equipment has the ability to reach ever lower levels of detection which is currently in the trillionth of a gram. At these levels, metabolites are considered irrelevant to the dog's performance by sports regulatory bodies. In recognition of the fact that humans can also be unintentionally contaminated, the tolerance for driving a car in Ireland is currently set at 10 mg/ml for cocaine in blood plasma and its metabolite is 15 mg/ml. In these circumstances it would not be best practice to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> On amendment No. 8d on the mandatory four-month disqualification period following the detection of a class A drug, the Bill already disqualifies a dog from racing until it passes a negative test and allows the board to set down further periods, based on the recommendations of the scientific advisory committee, where a greyhound may not race as it is deemed still to be affected by the residual performance effect following the negative test. This is a fair and balanced approach, based on scientific advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> Additionally, the Bill establishes a statutorily independent sanctioning regime through the establishment of the independent control committee in primary legislation, the expansion of the appeals committee role and the introduction of the District Court into the process. It places a strong emphasis on fair procedures in the conduct of investigation by the board regarding possible breaches of racing regulations and the conduct of hearings by the control committee in suspected breaches.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> To act outside of this regime by dispensing with due process would not be appropriate. The Bill sets down administrative sanctions that may be applied by the independent control committee and the appeal committee, with disqualification orders now being issued by these committees rather than the board. The proposed amendment to set down a mandatory disqualification period with no scientific basis in primary legislation would not reflect best practice.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I want to speak to my amendments Nos. 8b and 8d. I touched on the issue of drugs in the greyhound racing sector earlier and the nature of these amendments is to try to strengthen the integrity of this sector because it has been marred with drug abuses. The abuse of drugs in greyhound racing is either to make the dog go faster or to slow it down, but it has other unintended consequences for the welfare of the dog. To feed dogs cocaine, Viagra and amphetamines is disgraceful. I assure the House that the dogs do not go to the corner of the street and pick up these drugs themselves. Those responsible need to be dealt with on a more serious basis by the governing authority in this jurisdiction and I am not sure that is happening at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> To give one example on many, there is a greyhound owner and breeder by the name of John McGee who received a lifetime ban in the UK but continues to be allowed to race in Ireland every week. That is unacceptable and I cannot understand for the life of me-----</p>

          <p eId="para_332">I accept that.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">That gentleman is not the only one. As I said the other day, numerous people travel across the water, fill their dogs with drugs, race them on tracks in the United Kingdom, following which they are banned for perhaps six months, a year or a lifetime, as in the case I mentioned, yet, the following week or perhaps before the end of it, they are racing the same dogs on a track in Ireland. That is crazy. It does not work that way in athletics or any other sport. This year I raced at the world athletics championships in Spain and was drug tested after the race. If I had tested positive, I would have received a lifetime ban handed down by the IAAF and never been able to race again. How was a greyhound that had been banned across the water able to race in Ireland by the end of the same week? It is unacceptable. That is why I am talking about zero tolerance.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> I accept that the Minister of State has come here with a script from his officials that states the residue of drugs can be found on bank notes. I did not see many greyhounds walking or running down the street with a €50 note in the last while, which is all I will say on that issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_335"> I checked with those involved in other jurisdictions and what they do is very interesting. In Ireland we will have a threshold, which the Minister of State has outlined. However, the system does not work in that way in other jurisdictions where greyhounds are tested. This should have been made known by the Irish Greyhound Board to all concerned. It should be following best international practice in drug testing. There should be collaboration with every other jurisdiction where dogs are raced to find a unified international standard benchmark. That has not happened and I call for it to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> I took it upon myself to contact a laboratory director in Australia and received an email in response this week. I was inquiring about prohibited substances, in particular, morphine which is given to dogs here. Imagine giving morphine to a greyhound which is already suffering because it is injured to get it around the track. That is cruel. It is extreme cruelty, but it is happening right, left and centre in Ireland, although, of course, it is disregarded by the authorities. Mr. David Batty is the laboratory director of Racing Analytical Services in Victoria, Australia. In his email he thanks me for my inquiry and states: "An official morphine threshold does not exist in the Australian greyhound rules". If that is the case, why would we try to introduce such a threshold in Ireland? Morphine is given to suffering cancer patients. Why would it be given to a dog to allow it to get around the track? I cannot understand it. I will provide the Minister of State with a copy of the email for his review. Without reading the rest of it, the point is that there is no drugs threshold whatsoever in Australia. It has internal laborabory thresholds, but they are minimal in order to cover what the Minister of State mentioned about airborne substance threats. The only thresholds are for naturally occurring substances in the tissues or organisms of the greyhound, that is, substances such as testosterone, ethanol, cobalt, arsenic and so on. In short, there is no threshold for class A drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> It is worth reminding Members what I am looking for. Class A drugs include opium, heroin, ecstasy, crack, cocaine, LSD, magic mushrooms and amphetamines, or speed. We are creating legislation with thresholds for these drugs in greyhounds. I cannot get my head around this. I checked the legislative position in the United Kingdom. Again, there is zero tolerance of these substances, whereas we are trying to introduce, or continue with, a tolerance level. If that were to happen in any other sport such as Gaelic football, soccer or athletics, what grey area would be created for athletes, viewers, spectators and those betting at home? It would not send the right message. The right message is not being sent in this case either. A grey area is being created. </p>
          <p eId="para_338"> There is a two-tier greyhound industry because of the use of frozen semen and also drugs. There are numerous examples and articles have been written all over the world about greyhounds that won prize money here. It was found that they had been banned for drug use and that the trainer had run them again the following week. Anyone who gives heroin or another class A drug to a greyhound has no place in the sport and should receive a lifetime ban. We should be adopting the strict rules that are applied in the United Kingdom. It is as simple as that. Where there are grey areas, the lines become blurred. That is what has happened and why the reputational damage caused is so extreme. At least if there was zero tolerance, it would be much easier for the control committee and create clarity. It would also create clarity in the laboratory, as well as protecting the welfare of greyhounds. It is an animal welfare issue, about which animal welfare groups have contacted me. I know that Senators Higgins and Ruane have raised concerns in that regard. It is a key concern. Anyone who stuffs amphetamines, Viagra or cocaine into a greyhound knows that it is cruel, yet that is what happening <i>carte blanche</i> in every stadium throughout the country. That is the purpose of my amendments and why I am requesting that there be zero tolerance. </p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Under amendment No. 8d, where someone is found to have been giving a prohibited substance to a greyhound, there would be a minimum ban of four months. Otherwise, there could be a negative result within the four month period and the greyhound could be racing again. There has to be a minimum period. It is to try to bring clarity to the drugs issue and deal with it once and for all. Despite its best efforts, the Irish Greyhound Board has been found to be incapable of dealing with it. It has been ongoing for far too long and needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> As I outlined, there are two reasons drugs are given to greyhounds, the first of which is to make them go faster, while the second is to make them go slower. Ultimately, it has to do with betting in the industry because when there is insider knowledge and one knows that a dog will run fast or slow, the odds are predictable. It is very wrong, but it happens all the time. Drugs are not necessarily being given to a dog for it to win.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">It might be for the dog to finish last but it is causing the dog the same harm, so there is no level playing field and this needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> I hope the Minister will look at this zero tolerance issue because I am not willing to stand down on it. It is wrong on every level, from the welfare of the animals to the spectators who pay or those who do not go but may decide to bet on greyhounds at home online. If we look at the trajectory of figures over the past ten years since 2007, punters are not going to greyhound stadiums because they believe the races are fixed and the dogs are full of drugs. That is the perception that exists, and while that perception remains unchallenged and unaddressed, we have a major issue. The industry is on the way to the bottom and the only reason it is being maintained at the moment is because of the subvention from the betting tax. If that was not there, the industry would not be there, but it is wrong to provide that subvention and then have this drugs issue. The close links to criminal cartels here in Dublin can only be severed by dealing with the artificial insemination issue and the drugs issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> I ask the Minister of State to stand tough. I know I am probably getting a backlash from standing up and saying this but we have to do it because I care about the industry. I have never placed €1 on a dog. I have no financial interest in a dog or in dog breeding whatsoever but I believe it is the right thing to do. I come from a small farm in west Donegal and I believe that animals should be treated humanely and the way that greyhounds are being treated is not humane, so for that reason alone, if for no other reason, we should deal with the drugs issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_344">It has been outlined that there are serious animal welfare concerns in respect of the use of drugs in the industry, apart from the distorting of the industry and the other effects that my colleague has outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> I indicate my support for amendment No. 8d in particular. In section 27(3), I am concerned that at the moment it sets out that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_346">Where a sample from a greyhound is found to have present—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_347">(a) a prohibited or controlled substance, or</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_348">(b) a substance for which a maximum residue limit has been set and that limit has been exceeded, </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_349">under regulations made under this section<b>,</b> that greyhound shall be disqualified from racing and trialling—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_350">(i) until such time as it passes a subsequent test with negative results.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">There is a concern that we want to ensure that there is sanction. It is not simply a matter that a dog that has been shown to be affected and should not be racing while the effects of the substance can still be taking effect. It is also a matter that there needs to be a clear indication and punishment and a negative incentive against the use of such substances.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> That is why I strongly support amendment No. 8d, which suggests that in the cases where controlled or prohibited substances are present, that should amount to a ban from racing for a minimum period of four months and until a negative test is carried out. I recognise that there is some difference between section 27(3)(a) and (3)(b). Section 27(3)(a) refers to prohibited or controlled substances and (3)(b) refers to substances that have a residue limit that may have been exceeded because that may be a legal substance with a higher residue presence. It may be that they need to be separated, but for the moment I certainly support Senator Ó Domhnaill's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> I also note that I reserve the right to put forward an amendment to clarify that we need to have very particular, strict and punitive bans in respect of prohibited and controlled substances where they are to be found. That needs to be stricter because we are not just looking to see that these substances do not distort racing on a particular day but also to ensure that such a practice is actively discouraged within the industry because, if it is not, it will impact the industry and, most importantly, the animals. It is grotesque intentionally to subject animals to prohibited or controlled substances that nobody would give to a pet or put into anyone's body.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">On Senator Ó Domhnaill's amendments, the proposals for strict zero tolerance and a four-month minimum ban are rooted in the legislation as drafted. The applicable clause is based on scientific data and evidence. I accept what the Senator said about Australia and their laboratory levels but our equipment is so sophisticated now that it can detect levels that are minuscule and metabolites are considered to be irrelevant to a dog's performance by sports regulatory bodies. Levels can be so minuscule that they are not applicable. The contention is that levels must be practically applicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> On the four-month limit, the sanctions allow for an automatic ban the minute an animal is determined to have failed a test. Further sanctions can be applied. First, there is a sanction to determine whether there is any residual effect. If an animal is found to have a substance in its body, it is automatically banned. If that substance is at such a level that the residual effect will not be gone from the animal for two, three, four or six months, the ban can and should continue for that period. There is a control committee and an appeals committee which will determine the level of sanction. There is also the provision across the board in racing and coursing for a disqualification order and an exclusion order. People can be banned from attending either racing or coursing meetings, so it is quite extensive. That is provided for within the powers of the control committee and the appeals committee. The control committee views the results and makes a determination, and the appeals committee can consider it again if it is brought before it.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> Senator Higgins was more or less reiterating Senator Ó Domhnaill's points about the levels of sanctions. We are trying to keep this simple and effective by having an automatic ban upon failing a test and using the best scientific evidence we can avail of to determine if there are any residual effects that would influence the dog's performance, either to speed it up or slow it down as Senator Ó Domhnaill said. That is what the science and the equipment are there for and that is what the control committee and the appeals committee are there to determine.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">I thank the Minister of State. I understand where he is coming from but I do not necessarily agree with it. Both of these amendments are under section 27, which concerns the administration of substances to greyhounds, where it says that: "The Board may, after consultation with the Minister, make regulations for the control restriction, prohibition or administration of substances".</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I do not have the confidence in the board at the moment to deal with this issue effectively based on its past performance. Maybe under the stewardship of the new chairman and the new CEO that will change, but to date its performance has been shocking in this matter to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">That is why we should make a distinction. Class A drugs should be subject to zero tolerance. We are not talking about class B or C drugs. I have made a distinction around class A drugs. I would be willing to work with the Minister of State between now and Report Stage if he felt that was useful with a view to strengthening the provisions. Otherwise I will have to press amendment No. 8b today. In respect of amendment No. 8d, is there an alternative agreeable solution? The other example that was mentioned today was tuberculosis in cattle. If a test was positive, there would be two further tests and if they were negative the cattle would be allowed to be sold. Is that a way of dealing with this? There would have to be two negative tests after a positive test for the greyhound. I am just trying to strengthen this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> The Minister of State might outline what exactly happens at the moment and why dogs that test positive one week are allowed to race the following week. That appears to be happening but I do not know how. They can test positive in one stadium and then race again. Another question I cannot understand is around the testing regime. The dog is tested and the results are sent to the laboratory which, I understand, is located downstairs in the same premises as the Irish Greyhound Board in Limerick. The laboratory results are then given, I presume, to the head of regulation in the Irish Greyhound Board, before they go on to the control committee. Effectively, the head of regulation deals with all the samples that come back.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> If the Minister of State does not have the answer to my question today, maybe he or his officials could get back to me. Of the tests that were carried out in the laboratory in Limerick, were all of the positive results sent to the control committee? Did any of them accidentally fall between desks somewhere between the laboratory and the control committee? The only way we could find that out would be to add up the numbers for those that left the laboratory and those that arrived with the control committee. The Minister of State will not have that information today but I would be grateful if it could be made available over the next week or so.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> That is the second amendment. It is about trying to strengthen the provisions. If the Minister of State has a suggestion I am willing to accept it but I think there should be a minimum ban. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport took on a minimum ban recently which people criticised but people now know it is there. They should know it in this case as well. Trainers and breeders should know that if their dog tests positive, they and the dog will be out for a minimum of four months. I think that is reasonable and do not see why there would be any issue. If it were to take six or eight months for a negative test result to come back, the dog would not race for that period anyway. This is a minimum period of four months to try to cut out the situation where a dog that tests positive can miraculously have a negative test within ten days and be racing again. There is no disincentive for drug abuse there. These provisions aim to create a stronger disincentive for abusing drugs in the sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I am going to speak briefly in support of Senator Ó Domhnaill's amendment. A zero tolerance approach makes sense. I do not know why people would be allowed to race dogs again if they were caught giving the dog any amount of cocaine. Four months is not enough but I understand why we are putting in restrictions rather than completely banning people. There is an incentive to dope dogs if we do not have zero tolerance.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> As someone who has worked in the drugs sector for long enough, I know every trick in the book of people trying to get drugs out of their system before they have to give their weekly urine sample. Cocaine takes two to four days. A dog could be doped with cocaine and the drug would be gone from its system within two to four days. A person could increase the activity of the dog to allow it get the drug out of its system much quicker. If an individual has taken cocaine for three, four or five days in a row it can often take up to a week or 14 days at the most. I doubt it is very different for a dog. If a dog can have cocaine out of its system within two or three days, that negative test can come back straight away. It can come back after running the dog around for a whole day so the drug works itself out of the dog's system. If there is not zero tolerance, we will continue to have dogs being given cocaine because it is too easy to get away with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">As it stands at the moment, Bord na gCon has a scientific advisory committee that advises on thresholds. The equipment it has is very sophisticated. As far as I am aware, it has decided to publish every result, every positive finding, no matter how minuscule. Once that finding is published, it is determined to be a positive. Scientific data is used to determine whether the levels contained in the sample would have any effect, good or bad, on the animal's performance. On Senator Ruane's point, there are environmental contaminants that are unavoidable and that will show up with sophisticated testing but that do not have any actual material effect. Such contaminants could be on money notes, on the Senator's handkerchief or anything. That was the test that was done by Dublin City University.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> It is our aim to be practical and there is no scientific data or backup that says four months is mandatory. The amendment speaks more to a message rather than science; I accept that. It is to be a message to everyone that there is a minimum of four months. However, we are trying to base this primarily on scientific data. There could be a far greater ban. There are further sanctions for repeat offenders. This is within the remit of the control committee and the appeals committee. That is the purpose of separating out the body that applies the sanction, taking that power away from the board and giving it to the control and appeal committees. That is then seen to be at arm's length from the board itself, while it makes the regulation. It is the same principle as when the Government makes regulations for the likes of the banking sector but does not apply the rules. That is the purpose behind it. It is trying to be science based and is trying to allow for environmental contamination that will occur. It is on the basis of scientific knowledge determining what levels have a material impact. If there is any material impact on the dog's performance, that is not tolerable and is sanctioned. That is the key message.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">The Minister of State has largely answered the question I was going to ask. I was going to ask if there was any reason to propose that cocaine is a naturally occurring element in small amounts within a dog's blood anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">He answered by saying that these are small amounts of contaminant found from things like bank notes and so forth. This is very interesting because it shows how very widespread the taking of cocaine is in this country, if dogs are contaminated by bank notes. It made me wonder, somewhat whimsically, whether it might it be a good idea to have two races. One for dogs who are on drugs and one for dogs who are not on drugs. It would be fascinating to see dogs whizzing around at 50 miles an hour with sparks coming out of their backsides. It could be new sport: drug doggies.</p>

          <p eId="para_369">On being scientific and having environmental factors in contamination, the whole idea of cocaine being on notes has been around for a long time. It has been found on toilets and in suitcases. If my brother used a suitcase last week and he had cocaine in it and I take it the next week and there is no cocaine in it, it will show up if there has been contamination. That is human. We deal in notes. We deal in suitcases and all these things. The dogs are not going into the local shop with the fiver that has been used to snort cocaine to buy something with it-----</p>

          <p eId="para_372">My second amendment does not take away the discretion from the control committee. What I am suggesting is that there would be a minimum period of four months. The dog could not race after two or three days, as outlined by Senator Ruane, in that the dog could run around the track, the stuff could be sweat out of the system and the dog tests negative. This is wrong. We need a minimum period to ensure that what Senator Ruane says does not happen. That is absolutely essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> My other amendment on zero tolerance is backed up by a cross-party committee document, and the Indecon report. This committee, which the Minister of State chaired, stated in recommendation No. 13:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_374">The Committee recommends that a zero tolerance policy is vital on the issue of prohibited substances in greyhound racing. Therefore, a stringent adherence to best practice international standards is highly recommended to protect and develop the industry for future generations as highlighted in the Morris Report and must be expedited.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">On international standards, I mentioned Australia, which has a zero tolerance approach. The UK also has a zero tolerance approach, as set out in rule 217 of rules of greyhound racing of the Greyhound Board of Great Britain. Zero tolerance and best international standards are absolutely essential. There can be no place for any level of class A drugs in greyhound racing in Ireland. If that were to happen, it would breathe new life transparency into the sector. It may well play a role in removing some of the criminal elements that have become intertwined with the sector. It is essential that is introduced and it can be reviewed after 12 months if so required. I will press that amendment if necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">The Senator referenced international best practice. Even by his own admission in respect of the Australian model, he said zero tolerance is not zero levels. The inference is that zero tolerance is zero tolerance of the infringement. Zero levels is slightly different. I believe we are on the same page here. We both want zero tolerance.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> I refer to Senator Ruane's analogy. Dogs and animals interact with humans all of the time. Dogs brush off people's clothes when they are walking them, they put head collars on them and a thing on them. The human may not know they are contaminated. It is an airborne environmental issue. We have all sorts of airborne residues in our environment all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I have had to fence off badger setts so that my cattle cannot get into where they tear out the soil because the spores in the soil can cause TB, which the Senator mentioned. There is cross-contamination and there are vectors, carriers and so forth. I will not go into that today but that analogy was used and it is the same thing. We may have zero tolerance, but zero levels are not practical or applicable. We are trying to establish no tolerance for levels that are above the tolerable level.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">I move amendment No. 16a:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_498">In page 30, line 10, after “approval.” to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_499">	“Where the compliance issue relates to use of class A prohibited substances, the board shall suspend the licence, permit or approval for a minimum period of not less than 3 months.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">Section 33 deals with the revocation or suspension of licences, permits or approvals and relates to my earlier question. It states:<i>
						</i>"Where the holder of a licence, permit or approval fails to comply with a condition attached to it, the Board may suspend for such time as it thinks fit or revoke the licence, permit or approval." I propose to insert after the word "approval" an additional provision whereby if the compliance issue relates to the use of class A prohibited drugs identified under statute, such as cocaine and speed, the board "shall", rather than "may" suspend the licence for a minimum of three months. </p>
          <p eId="para_501"> I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's view on this amendment. I tabled it in the face of the damage being done to the industry by drug abuse. While only small numbers of people are involved, they cast a dark shadow over the entire greyhound industry. It is a wonderful industry with wonderful people but, unfortunately, a small number of trainers are infusing dogs with drugs and they should be dealt with harshly. While I could have suggested a much longer suspension period, I believe that three months is reasonable. There may be a need to make a distinction between other substances and class A drugs in the legislation and I would be happy to work with the Minister of State to come up with an alternative wording on Report Stage, if necessary. There is no place in greyhound racing for those who abuse drugs and feed drugs to dogs. I hope the Minister of State is willing to accept this amendment or to come up with an alternative wording on Report Stage that achieves the same objective.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">Section 33 deals with the revocation or suspension of licences, permits or approvals. The amendment relates to a breach of racing regulations specific to the use of controlled or prohibited substances. Such sanction breaches are the domain of the control committee and appeal committee, not the board. Revocations and suspensions by the board relate to administrative matters including, for example, the non-payment of licence fees or similar licence conditions. The amendment, therefore, is not relevant to this section. In that context, I ask the Senator to reconsider his intention to press the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_505">I move amendment No. 16b:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_506">In page 38, line 1, to delete "may serve not more than 2 consecutive terms" and substitute "shall not serve more than 1 term and shall be replaced immediately to ensure no vacancy arises".</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> These amendments relate to the racing control committee. Amendment No. 16<i>b</i> relates to the length of the term served by members of the committee. The Bill provides that membership of the control committee will be for a period of four years per term. Under section 44(9), a member of the control committee may serve not more than two consecutive terms but I propose that members should not serve more than one term. The two consecutive terms' provision means that a board member could be a member of the control committee for up to eight years, which is a long period, particularly given the importance of the control committee in dealing with the drugs problem in the sport. It would be better to have a greater turnover of people on the control committee. I do not suggest that people should be turned over more frequently but that there should be fresh opinions coming to the committee. Eight years is a lengthy period for anyone to serve on what is a sub-committee of the Irish Greyhound Board. I propose that members only serve one four-year term, which is still a substantial period.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Amendment No. 16<i>c</i> deals with conflicts of interest in the context of membership of the control committee. The Bill provides that a member of the control committee "shall disclose any potential conflict of interest". My amendment provides that members, including the chairperson "shall possess no conflict of interest whatsoever (to include family ties or involvement with greyhounds in any way) in order to exercise clear objectivity and independence". The control committee is concerned with the testing of greyhounds for prohibited substances and with test results that come back from the laboratories. My amendment seeks to provide reassurance to the outside world and to the sector that the control committee is independent, impartial and transparent and that its members do not have any conflicts of interest or linkages in respect of greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I do not say it is the case, but, for instance, if a member or the chairperson of the control committee was to have dogs trained by a trainer and if they tested positive for drugs, that would leave the member or the chairperson with a conflict of interest, as he or she would not be impartial and it would be wrong to suggest otherwise. I fully respect the fact that it is hard to get people to serve on committees and that many people have links to whatever interest is involved. That may well be the case, but if we are to properly deal with drug use in this sport, we cannot have people making decisions in cases with which they are linked in any way. That would be akin to an athlete testing positive for drugs and having a brother, sister or other family member on the adjudication committee of the sport concerned or at the World Anti-Doping Agency. Would that be allowed? Of course, it would not. Why should it be allowed here? There is no rationale to allow it to happen. That is from where my amendment is coming. If we are to clean up the sport, it is essential that we get right the foundations, of which this is another element.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> I am willing to work with the Minister of State on this issue before Report Stage, but the measure is essential because we cannot have grey areas. I do not suggest, for example, that one of the control committee members or the chairperson is compromised. I am sure they do an excellent job, but I know for a fact that some members of the control committee have dogs who are racing and trained by trainers with questionable pasts in terms of drug use. How can they be at arm's length from the decision-making process? How can they provide for independent, objective scrutiny or decision-making? They really cannot do so because their decision-making is clouded, despite their best intentions. The legislation must be crystal clear. I suggest we must go down this road if we want to have a fresh wind in the sector and help everybody involved in it. This is not about attacking anybody; rather, it is about helping everyone and a sector which this year is in receipt of more than €300,000 per week from the betting fund. That is an awful lot of money going to the industry; therefore, we must make sure we get the absolute minimum requirements right. There cannot be grey areas. Any other sector or sport would not allow that to happen and greyhound racing should not be any different.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I will speak to the two amendments separately. I will deal first with amendment No. 16<i>b</i> which concerns the maximum number of terms a member of the control committee can serve. It is standard practice and in compliance with the code of governance for control committee members to serve two terms. In the pre-legislative scrutiny process the joint committee recognised that it might be difficult to find sufficient people with the right skill set willing to participate in the control committee. For that reason, it did not question the fact that they would serve two terms. In fact, it suggested going further. It advised that the three-year term, as proposed at the time the general scheme was being discussed, should be revised upwards to four years. The legislation reflects that suggestion. In the circumstances it is not intended to accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> In relation to amendment No. 16<i>c</i> and the issue of a conflict of interest, section 12 deals comprehensively with the disclosure of interests, including family ties, as referred to by the Senator. The principles behind the section are standard across similar legislation. Limiting the issue of conflict of interests to this section, as proposed, would undermine the all-embracing corporate governance procedures outlined in section 12, but we may have a solution to which I mentioned to the Senator.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianODomhnaill" eId="spk_243">
          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_513">I thank the Minister of State for his response and engagement. Corporate governance would be strengthened, rather than weakened, in accepting the amendment. Corporate governance in State boards is something on which the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has done a lot of excellent work, in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration and others. While the control committee is not a State board, it is a sub-committee that is dealing with the eradication of drugs in the sport and involved in the making of adjudication decisions on the validity or otherwise of laboratory results. It needs absolute independence from the sector as otherwise there will be a grey area. I am not sure how that issue can be addressed. The Minister of State has indicated that he will look at the matter and I am willing to await the outcome of his deliberations. If that is the case, I will withdraw the amendment and resubmit it on Report Stage. In the meantime perhaps we might work on a wording. I am not sure whether the Minister of State is willing to come as far as might be acceptable to me, but in a spirit of co-operation I am willing to try.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I know that the Minister of State's heart is in the right place. He is bringing forward the legislation at a very important time. It is excellent and will strengthen the sector. My objective is to make it better. This area needs an independent evaluation mechanism. I am not casting aspersions on anyone involved in the control committee - neither the chairperson nor any member - but I am raising serious questions. I would be conflicted if I was chairman of the control committee and had a greyhound that was racing and that was being trained by a trainer who previously had dogs that had tested positive for drugs and if I was expected to make decisions on other dogs tested for drugs and with the same trainer. It does not make sense, but that is what is happening and if we allow it to continue, the legislation will rubber-stamp it. I am willing to meet the Minister of State halfway to find a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I gather the Minister of State is not willing to concede on the four-year term. Could we reach a compromise to allow me not to press the amendment? Eight years is a long time for someone to be a member of the control committee. It also precludes more people from getting involved in such a committee. Let us take as an example someone who becomes involved in the control committee who is independent of the greyhound industry but who, or a family member, might develop an interest in owning a greyhound. He or she might not want to serve on the control committee for a period greater than four years because he or she might want to buy a greyhound but cannot do so as he or she would no longer be independent. Therefore, it might be better to shorten the term as it might improve the position in finding candidates. Could the term be made shorter, for example, three years instead of four? Would that be an alternative solution?</p>

        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_244" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_516">I should have corrected the point when the Senator said the control committee was a sub-committee. It is not; it is an independent committee, as is the appeals committee. It is proposed that a panel of eight will constitute the control committee. A hearing will require the presence of the chairperson or vice chairperson, plus two members. Anyone with a conflict of interest will have to declare it. Section 12 outlines the procedure in great detail. An extensive list is outlined. I think we can include something in the wording that will reference section 12, for the purposes of clarity, to ensure everyone will know that it is the section 12 rules that pertain.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">From the point of view of the control committee being independent and objective, it will be comprised of a panel of eight members, but a hearing will require only a chair or vice chair plus two members. There is also an appeals committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> With regard to the term, the draft pre-legislative scrutiny material referenced three years. The joint committee in its deliberations reached the conclusion that getting a panel of interested people would be a challenge and for this year the term should be four years. It is not obligatory for members to serve two terms and people can retire. It is important there is a continuous flow of people onto the board such that we do not have to replace the entire membership of the board on completion of its term. There is more work to be on the establishment of the board that is not appropriate to primary legislation. It is likely these issues will be addressed in the terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> On amendment No. 16c, it may be possible to draw its phraseology into section 12. In regard to the term, we are providing in legislation that a person "may", not "must", serve. I ask Senators to bear this in mind.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">I move amendment No. 17:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_522">In page 48, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_523">
            <b>"Export of greyhounds</b>
          </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_524"><b>56. </b>(1) It shall be an offence for a person within the State to export, attempt to export or assist another person within the State in the export or attempted export, of a greyhound to a country which is not included in the white list prepared by the Minister in accordance with <i>subsection (2)</i>.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_525">(2) The Minister shall publish a white list of countries which meet minimum standards with regard to the welfare of greyhounds and to which the licensed export of greyhounds from the State shall be permissible.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_526">(3) When preparing the white list under <i>subsection (2)</i>, the Minister shall have regard to each of the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_527">(a) the past record of the relevant country in relation to the welfare protections for greyhounds and the welfare of animals more generally;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_528">(b) the existence in the relevant country of enforceable welfare protections for greyhounds which are equivalent to the protections available in the State;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_529">(c) the monitoring and enforcement in the relevant country of the welfare protections in <i>paragraph (b)</i>; and </p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_530">(d) the standards of care and management to which the greyhounds are likely to be subjected to in the relevant country.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_531">(4) A person who is guilty of an offence under <i>subsection (1) </i>is liable on summary conviction to a class A fine.".</p>
          <p eId="para_532">These amendments relate to the export of Irish greyhounds to countries with records of the mistreatment and abuse of greyhounds, and an attempt to restrict, ban and-or regulate these exports. They are the most substantial changes we are proposing to the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I thank Dogs Trust Ireland for its help in drafting these amendments, Deputy Broughan, whose 2017 Private Members' Bill, the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill influenced their drafting, as well as Senator Black and her office for their work in bringing them to the floor of the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> While Ireland may have strong legal and statutory protections for greyhounds and animal welfare more generally, this is not the case in many countries around the world. Greyhound racing has a long and proud tradition in Ireland and we have a responsibility to protect the welfare of Irish greyhounds around the world to the same standard as they are treated here. It is an unfortunate reality that we are exporting greyhounds to countries where they are being mistreated, abused and subjected to treatment that would be wholly contrary to Irish law if it were to take place on this island. In its submission to the pre-legislative scrutiny process on this legislation, Dogs Trust Ireland pointed to international destinations for Irish greyhound exports such as Macau in China where high-profile welfare cases have hit the media and where horrendous records of animal cruelty have been recorded. It noted that dogs have been thrown into boiling water, horrifically mistreated during their racing careers and even skinned and sold as food in Macau markets. I welcome that particular airlines have refused to fly dogs to such countries but this is but a piecemeal effort where we need statutory control.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> Dogs Trust Ireland has evidence that dog exports from Ireland to countries with terrible records, such as China, Pakistan and Argentina, are on the rise. We need to act. These amendments are tabled in the spirit of protecting these animals and placing responsibility on the Irish State for the health, welfare and lives of Irish greyhounds. Amendment No. 17 would effectively make it an offence to export greyhounds to countries such as these and would save Irish greyhounds from this cruel and degrading treatment. The section would empower the Minister to publish a white list of countries with animal welfare protections equivalent to Ireland. The export of greyhounds from Ireland to countries on the white list would be legal and it would be illegal to export to countries not included on that list.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> Amendment No. 18 relates to the secondary export of greyhounds. If we were to include amendment No. 17 in the Bill, the effective statutory ban on exports to countries with terrible animal welfare practices would have a significant loophole in that an exporter could simply export to a country on the white list for the purposes of exporting to a country not on that list. Amendment No. 18 would close off this loophole and ban the secondary export of greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Amendment No. 19 is a compromise option and simply seeks to improve the data available in this area. It would require the Minister to publish an annual report to be laid before the Oireachtas, containing the numbers of greyhounds exported in the previous year, to which countries they were exported, and a summary of the standards of greyhound welfare in those countries. It would allow for the sector to be brought within the data collection responsibilities of the Department and give the Department a role in analysing the animal welfare standards in the countries to which Ireland is exporting dogs. If dogs are being exported to countries which mistreat animals, we need to know that.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> I am sure the Minister of State will agree with the sentiment of what we are trying to achieve, but he may say that these restrictions may not be compatible with EU trade law. Under Articles 34 and 35 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU, trade rules are generally common across all EU member states. On this basis, individual member states cannot unilaterally introduce quantitative restrictions on trade. Article 36 of TFEU, however, expressly provides for exceptions as long as they can be justified on grounds of public morality, public policy or public security; or the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants. The language of Article 36 is important. It accepts the general principle of free trade but recognises that there are some exceptional circumstances in which a derogation might be necessary. Importantly, it explicitly includes the protection of the health and life of animals as relevant circumstances and grounds for restriction. In this case, this is one of the relatively rare situations where the State would have a strong case to make for an Article 36 exemption because of the very real threat to the life of greyhounds. This is well substantiated in the research from Dogs Trust Ireland and other organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> The State would also have to justify whether this restriction is proportional and if there was some other, less onerous way to achieve the goal of protecting the life of these animals. Again, we have a strong case to make here. We cannot, and would not want to, police what happens in other jurisdictions. Once an animal leaves Ireland, we can track its location but we cannot meaningfully protect it. Therefore, one of the only plausible policy options open to us is to ensure that we do not directly facilitate their exportation to places where there is a reasonable expectation that their health and life would be endangered.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> I understand that the Minister of State would not want to preside over a situation where Irish greyhounds are being exported to countries where they are being mistreated, maimed and harmed. I appreciate he may have concerns regarding these amendments but I urge him to consider them seriously as additions to the Bill. These cases are horrific, sad, downright wrong and unfair on the animals. We can safeguard these dogs with these amendments. I urge the Minister of State to take them on board.</p>

          <from>Senator Ray Butler<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_541">I come from a background and in greyhounds, which have been in my family all my life. I have seen dramatic changes in the ways greyhounds are exported from Ireland. For the past four to five years, they must be microchipped, have a passport and receive injections for rabies and various illnesses before export. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also has to give a passport which is permission for the dog to be exported. I agree that nobody wants to see any greyhound go to China or Macau. In all the years I have been in the greyhound industry, I have seen very few greyhounds sent to Macau and China. When the issue is brought up there is uproar because the standard of treatment of greyhounds in those countries is terrible.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> We have come a long way and done much for the health and safety of greyhounds. Of the greyhounds born in this country, 80% go across the water and 80% of the greyhounds that race in England are Irish-bred. They all have to get microchips, passports and injections from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I agree with the Senator that we have to tighten up the law further afield. I have no doubt there are animals that slip through the net but the number has decreased in recent years because of the draconian requirements to get microchips, injections and passports. A local vet must also check the welfare of the dog in the 24 hours before it is exported. The vet checks its earmarking and makes sure the dog is healthy to travel before signing off on its export.</p>

          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">I commend Senator Ruane on this very important amendment. We compliment ourselves in this country that we treat animals well. We do so up to a point but not beyond a certain point. Cases of animal cruelty are brought to public attention from time to time and Ireland is Europe's number one country for puppy farming, which is an obscene business. Supposing we were perfect, which we are not, it would not be sufficient for us to be perfect in this country. We would also have to ensure, as Senator Ruane's amendments propose to do, that the countries to which these animals are exported also have high standards, which they do not. The point that has been caught by these amendments is that there can be a second country referring to another country. We can say we ban exports to one country but then we export them to a second country and that country exports them to these malignant regimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> The treatment of animals in the Orient is horrendous. Senator Ruane mentioned that dogs are skinned but she left out was that they are often skinned alive, as are cats. I have seen video footage of cats having the skin taken off their flesh while they were alive and heard the poor unfortunate animals screaming from the agony they were put through.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> I strongly support these amendments. Senator Ruane is 100% justified in saying that Article 36 provides adequate justification because what could be clearer than that we are dealing with the welfare of animals? Does anybody suggest they enjoy being skinned alive? It would be a very funny thing if they did. I strongly support Senator Ruane's amendments and I honour her for putting them down.</p>

          <p eId="para_546">I support the proposed new section and amendments Nos. 17, 18 and 19, which propose the drawing up of register of countries that have met acceptable standards in greyhound welfare. If this type of approach was taken to trading in other goods, we would be better at protecting human rights. Amendment No. 18 proposes to make it an offence to export a greyhound to a country on the white list with full knowledge that it will be subsequently exported to a country that is not on the white list. I support that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> The use of microchipping, to which a previous speaker alluded, would simplify the process of producing an annual report, as provided for in amendment No. 19. It would not be especially onerous to produce such a report given that most of the data have already been gathered. I hope the Minister of State can accept that Article 36 is robust enough to allow this country to make its own trading laws in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">I support Senator Ruane's amendments. They come from an animal welfare perspective and many of them fulfil the criteria of animal welfare. This is an opportunity to improve the welfare of greyhounds, particularly greyhounds that are exported to countries with very poor track records in the manner in which they treat dogs or other animals. I was particularly taken by amendment No. 19, which makes the excellent proposal to have an annual report and produce a league table of the countries to which we export greyhounds.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">Amendment No. 19 is in the group we are discussing. The proposal is an excellent idea and I hope it can be incorporated into the legislation. We should be concerned about the manner in which we treat all pets and animals. If we are sending greyhounds to countries with poor track records, we should be concerned about it. We should also be concerned about the manner in which we treat greyhounds here. We have talked about that today. We are discussing a new section 56 dealing with the eligibility of registered greyhounds to race. We must include in the legislation more stringent controls over animal welfare and abuse of greyhounds. Senator Ruane is right to propose these amendments and I sincerely hope the Minister of State will look favourably on them. I will raise some specific points on the section when we conclude our discussion on the amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> We should all remember that a greyhound makes an excellent family pet. When greyhounds come to the end of their racing cycle, they have to be rehomed. We have heard horror stories of greyhounds being killed because, in the view of those who race them, they are not fit for racing. That is terrible. There is an organisation within the control of the Irish Greyhound Board. I am not sure of the name but I think it is the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust. It is an excellent way of rehoming greyhounds that have fulfilled their racing obligations. There are charitable organisations doing exactly the same work. I have read stories about members of the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust flying to Canada with Irish greyhounds to try to get them rehomed. Many people here who are looking for family pets do not even know greyhounds are available to be taken as family pets.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Should a campaign not be established by the Irish Greyhound Board in respect of rehoming greyhounds that have been retired? I assure the House that while Canada is a great place, it costs a lot of money to bring a greyhound there. It eats into the budget. There are many in Ireland, especially children, who would love a greyhound as a family pet. Maybe that should be considered. We cannot do it in the legislation. Would it not be a wonderful campaign to have up and running for Christmas? There are children looking for pets and there are retired greyhounds that we could rehome in family homes in Ireland. It would be a wonderful news story. I cannot understand why this was not done before. I am aware that some of the charities are doing it but I am not sure whether the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust has done it. Perhaps it is something the trust should consider. How many of the hundreds of greyhounds that reach the end of their racing careers each year are rehomed in Ireland? Is it more lucrative to export them? I do not know the answer but am just posing the question. I support the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> If amendments Nos. 17 and 18 are not acceptable to the Department, amendment No. 19 offers a fantastic compromise. I see absolutely nothing wrong with it. The amendment would strengthen the Minister’s hand and improve animal welfare. We brought animal welfare legislation through the Houses not too long ago but unfortunately the standards set out in that legislation are not being complied with in respect of racing greyhounds. I am not sure why that happens. We have heard stories today about greyhounds being fed everything from cocaine to Viagra.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">I shall discuss amendments Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, together. The aim of the Senators proposing the amendments is commendable and understandable. They are concerned with the welfare of greyhounds. Even if it were legally possible to ban the export of greyhounds to certain countries, I would not be convinced that the amendments proposed would have the effect desired by the Senators. The amendments would be unworkable and impossible to enforce. The reality is that the United Kingdom is where the majority of greyhounds are exported to. It is not for the Department to police whether greyhounds sent to the UK or any other country are subsequently sent on to another country.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">I am not here to defend any other country’s record on animal welfare but we must be clear that, setting aside the unworkability of the amendments, any legislation banning the exportation of greyhounds to certain countries would face significant legal difficulties. The Department examined this issue. We sought and obtained legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the Private Members’ Bill introduced by Deputy Tommy Broughan, which proposed measures similar to those we are discussing now. The advice from the Attorney General was that the Bill was incompatible with domestic and European law. Despite our differences on the amendments proposed, we share the aim of protecting the welfare of animals. The Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 obliges Bord na gCon to publish a code of practice for the welfare of greyhounds. The primary objective of the code is to set standards and clearly define what is expected of all individuals engaged in the care and management of registered greyhounds. The board proposes to expand the existing code to include provisions regarding best practice when exporting greyhounds. We referred earlier to the issue of retired greyhounds in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> In the context of reporting on the exportation of greyhounds, it is not currently possible to retrieve the information being requested. The TRACES system used to record the exportation of canines does not differentiate between greyhounds and other dogs, no more than it distinguishes between breeds of cattle or horses, so it is not possible, therefore, to report on greyhounds exported to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Let me respond to Senator Ó Domhnaill on the issue of retirement. The Irish Retired Greyhound Trust has helped to rehome over 5,300 racing greyhounds since 2008, with 853 rehomed between January and October of this year. A further 58 are on the list for rehoming between now and the end of the year. These greyhounds will be rehomed as pets in homes in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, the Czech Republic and Belgium. The Irish Greyhound Board contributed over €100,000 to the Retired Greyhound Trust in 2017. The main source of funding for the trust continues to come from greyhound racing owners through a 2% reduction in all winners’ prize money. This funding is matched by the Irish Greyhound Board. The Department continues to lend its support through the provision of free passports to retired greyhounds when they are to be rehomed abroad. The trust also provides financial assistance to private rehoming agencies in Limerick, Clare, Tipperary, Kerry and Belfast.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I mentioned earlier the question of the Irish attitude towards animals. By and large, it is more or less all right. What about those who knowingly export greyhounds to the countries in question? They are skunks if ever I came across them. I do not accept what the Minister of State says. I do not accept that it is unworkable to institute these amendments. The Minister of State talked about legal difficulties. The legal difficulties have been adequately exploded by Senator Ruane. Article 36 makes a clear exception for the health and welfare of animals. What greater health and welfare conditions could one have?</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> With regard to the keeping of statistics, we are notoriously bad in this country. The Minister of State said it is impossible to do what is proposed because we do not differentiate between different types of dogs. Perhaps because of the particularities of the greyhound industry, we should start instituting a regime whereby greyhounds are set aside. They are a particular type of dog that attracts a particular a particular type of difficulty. Therefore, the required statistics should be kept. Ireland is not good at keeping statistics. We should do better.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">We have come a long way in the past three or four years with the microchipping of dogs and passports. We must be very careful, however, not to impose additional expenses on breeders of greyhounds. A little microchip that goes into a dog’s back costs 50 cent or €1 at most. When one goes to the control steward and asks him to microchip a dog, it might cost €25.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">If there are eight dogs in a litter, it costs €200. I fear that breeders or people rearing greyhounds might school the greyhounds at an early stage, find out if they are any good, and if they are no good, get rid of them completely under the radar without them being microchipped or anything being done with them. We need to be very careful about the expense to be placed on breeders to do all this. A grant system or something else should be put in place to help them so that they will go through the procedures. I have seen the changes over the past four or five years on passporting and microchipping.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">We are not suggesting policing the other countries. It is impossible to police the exporting from another country. Our amendment places the onus on the person exporting from here. If we obtain knowledge that that dog has been sent to a secondary country to reach its destination, the person here would be here would be held responsible if they knew that the dog was going through Britain or another European country en route to another country with lower standards. We are not necessarily looking to police what happens when it goes to another country. However, the person here should know the country to which they are sending the dog.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> Senator Norris is right that there is no harm in updating how we collect data on dogs. He mentioned puppy farms as well. Dogs are a particular category of animal and we should look for a greater breakdown on dogs. In particular, greyhounds are a separate category because of racing. We may need to create a system to collect the data we know. I believe 85% of dogs currently go to the UK, which is great. How do we know that figure, if we cannot give the breakdown for greyhounds because those data are only collected as canine? How do we have those figures in the first place?</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I accept the Minister of State is bound by the advice of the Attorney General and that may preclude him from accepting amendments Nos. 17 and 18. However, the only body that can make a definitive judgment on the compatibility or workability of what we are proposing is the European Court of Justice. Whether this violates Articles 34 and 35 of the EU treaty and whether it would be allowable under Article 36 is not for the Attorney General to determine. It would be determined by whether we would be willing to expand our political efforts in Ireland by seeking an EU derogation to protect the lives, health and well-being of greyhounds. I urge the Minister of State to consider whether this is an issue on which we are willing to take a stand for animal welfare and put the Department's efforts into making what would admittedly be a bold move, but one that we could stand over on the European or international stage as Ireland would become a leader in protecting the welfare of greyhounds domestically and internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> I accept this may not be a decision the Minister of State can make today. I ask him to consider amendment No. 19 as a compromise. That would have no material impact on the export of greyhounds but would give the Department a data collection role in the area. It would increase transparency and accountability by helping the Department, Members of the Oireachtas and the public know how many of our greyhounds are being exported, where they are going and how they are being treated when they get there.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> In our meeting yesterday, the Minister of State expressed some concerns over the phrasing of the amendment and whether such a report would be better delivered to an Oireachtas joint committee rather than to the Houses. I am happy to review the issue before Report Stage. I urge the Minister of State to give this serious consideration. We should show that as a country we care about the animal at all stages of its life. Having clear accurate data on where it goes when it leaves our country shows that we actually care about the greyhound and that we do not merely care about the function it serves on the racetrack.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> I would ask the Minister of State and his officials to have a discussion on amendment No. 19. That would serve a greater purpose than just being transparent. If those data existed, even if they are in the minority of 15% or 20% that go outside those European countries, people would be less likely to send them to those countries if they knew these data were published and transparent. It might in itself serve as a deterrent from sending animals to countries that do not have good welfare standards.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">The number of dogs going to the UK is extrapolated from the number of Irish greyhounds registered with Bord na gCon that subsequently show up as registered in the UK. We can get an update on the figure. I am told it is a good bit higher than 85%.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> On the animals rehomed in the countries I outlined, because the Department issues a passport, it can correlate with the first registration so that it knows they are greyhounds. I have no objection to giving the report. However, the tracing system that is used across a number of different areas does not provide us with the ability to distinguish between breeds. Canines, cats and horses are all categorised under their species. We are able to get the good data on greyhounds through another channel. That is because they subsequently show up as registered in the Greyhound Board of Great Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> Senator Ó Domhnaill asked about the welfare of greyhounds. In 2017, Bord na gCon carried out 477 kennel inspections, undertook 48 welfare investigations and issued 48 sanctions.

          <p eId="para_586">We can track the registration of the greyhounds between here and the UK. Dogs are given passports before they are exported. Through the passport, could we not identify the countries they are travelling to? There must be some purpose for that passport being accounted for in the country in which it arrives. There must be some available data through the passport. Does something show up on a system in another country that a dog passport has been checked on arrival there? How does that work?</p>

          <p eId="para_587">Those data are not stored on the microchip. The microchip obviously stays with the animal. There are also ear markings.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> We can get up-to-date figures from Bord na gCon as to whether it is 80%, 85% 90% or whatever. We can then get the percentage that are rehomed. We are then left with a small cohort. What we are left with then is the total of number of canines exported and where they were exported to. The purpose of registration and traceability is to try to track animals through their life and beyond racing or whatever. Through the various provisions in this legislation on traceability, health and welfare, we are trying to ensure that, through the animal's life, its owners and minders are subject to scrutiny so that they are mindful that they have a duty of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> At least 90% of animal keepers love their animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">That is the nature of it. It is often said we spend 80% of our time here dealing with the 10%. That is not just the case in this House; some school teachers have had the same experience. If we were able to extrapolate from the data further, we would not have any problem with including them. I am just giving the Senator the facts. Following our discussions yesterday, we investigated the matter and this is what we found.

          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill<recordedTime time="2018-11-15T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_622">Section 56 concerns the eligibility to race of registered greyhounds. It refers to registration in the Irish greyhound stud book, the holder of which I understand is the Irish Coursing Club. We have the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club and every time I ask a question about artificial insemination, one seems to blame the other, which is regrettable. I wonder if an efficiency saving could be made by amalgamating the two bodies because they more or less seem to do the same thing. I understand the Irish Coursing Club has a chief executive officer, whose only job is to keep the stud book and oversee two tracks in the North. </p>
          <p eId="para_623"> The main point I want to make concerns the eligibility to race of greyhounds listed in the Irish stud book. I am concerned about greyhounds that are racing illegally on Irish tracks every week in contravention of the 2014 regulations introduced by Bord na gCon. There is no compliance with the regulations which centre on the issue of artificial insemination or the use of frozen semen. This issue has not been dealt with, despite the fact that the Irish Greyhound Board and the Department received legal advice from the barrister Mr. Ross Aylward in February 2013 to the effect that it was illegal to continue to use frozen semen from dogs that were long dead and insert it into bitches. That is still happening. A cartel is operating within the sector and the issue is not being addressed. Section 56 provides us with an opportunity to deal with it. Is there a willingness within the Department to deal with it once and for all and make sure the 2014 regulations will be upheld? The regulations were introduced following consultation, had the consent of the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and were made under section 39 of the 1958 Greyhound Act. The amended artificial insemination of greyhounds regulations were introduced by Bord na gCon in 2014 and came into effect on 1 November of that year. They removed the two year limit on the use of semen for the purposes of artificial insemination following the death of a stud dog, but they did not have retrospective effect. </p>
          <p eId="para_624"> At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 20 October 2015 I had the opportunity to question a member of the board of Bord na gCon, Mr. Colm Gaynor, on the dogs that continued to race illegally. He said the following: "Those dogs have not been brought back into compliance. That is the legal problem. The dogs before 1 November cannot now be brought back into legal compliance, as the Senator puts it, but to be definite, they are registered and are on the stud book." If they are registered and on the stud book, that means that they are on it illegally. That cannot be allowed to continue. This problem is causing friction in the sector and placing enormous obstacles in the way of ordinary people who want to breed and train greyhounds. They cannot compete because the AI issue is just a financial minefield. </p>
          <p eId="para_625"> Let us say Senator Norris wants to have his greyhound inseminated. He must bring the dog to one of five licensed centres in the country and collect it after it has been inseminated with semen which has been kept in cold storage. I mentioned the case of a dog sired by a dog by the name of Trade Official that had been born in 1992, or 26 years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">Indeed, the old dog for the hard road. That dog is dead. As the normal lifespan of a dog is much less than 26 years, presumably, the semen was frozen, but it continues to be used today. That is wrong. Is the Minister of State willing to deal with the issue? I hope to have an opportunity to introduce an amendment on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> There is a cartel operating within the industry. As I understand it, one centre in the North is flaunting the fact that it has in cold storage and available for use €5 million worth of AI seed from male greyhounds. How can the ordinary punter deal with this? Most owners and breeders cannot afford the AI fees which range from €2,000 to €7,000 to have a dog sired.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Therefore, they are being left helpless because this is continuing despite the fact the regulation is there and the Irish Greyhound Board chooses not to implement it. I do not understand why it is not being implemented. Surely if Bord na gCon introduced a regulation in 2014, it should be implemented. Perhaps it is beyond the scope of the Minister of State's remit but how can it be dealt with? What is the Department's view on dealing with the issue once and for all? It is a massive bone of contention. It is really unfair. There is no equity in the issue of AI. It is grossly unfair to have a cartel in the sector. It is very wrong and it needs to be dealt with. I am not sure exactly how. One way would be to ban frozen semen altogether. That would be the simple way to deal with it. I am not sure whether the Minister would be open to that at this stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_632">There are two different groups in the greyhound world. We have the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Greyhound Board. In the 1980s and 1990s, if people wanted to register their names as owners or if they wanted to register a greyhound they had to be a member of the Irish Coursing Club and have a membership card. This is how it ended up with the registration of litters and this has continued. I see where the Senator is coming from.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> On the frozen semen issue, it was rescinded by the board in 2014. I see greyhounds in England every day of the week. I saw a 2017 Pacific Mile pup run the other night and win in Nottingham but he has been dead since the mid-1990s. Top Honcho dogs run every so often and he is also dead since the 1990s.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">Senator Norris would last forever. There are minuses and pluses with these centres but the plus side is that much of the frozen semen coming in has made it cheaper in certain cases to get dogs of the likes of Top Honcho and Australian dogs such Frightful Flash. In certain centres the frozen semen was a quarter of the price when the stud dog was alive. It has made it cheaper for the ordinary Joe Soap to get fashionable dog so not everybody in the game would be in favour of banning frozen semen. When we were rearing we never used it. We always liked to see the natural mating go ahead in front of us. It was rescinded in 2014 and it is no longer illegal. I see these dogs running every day of the week on British and Irish tracks. Nothing illegal is being done respect of these dogs that have been dead for 20 years, with frozen semen being used and new progeny running on the tracks.</p>

          <p eId="para_655">We were discussing section 30 when I reported progress yesterday. It occurred to me overnight that it is all very well to talk about €500,000 per annum being the increased cost of this body, but I ask Senators to consider that if this is to become a permanent or semi-permanent part of the budget of the State, it is equivalent, in terms of annual interest servicing, to an increase in the national debt of approximately €25 million. If we could put the €500,000 which is proposed to be spent on what I consider to be an extremely wasteful project into debt-servicing or whatever, we would be able to retire debt to the amount of €25 million. This is assuming that we will not be running surpluses. We never seem to get to a budget surplus. Perhaps this year will be the year we hit a budget surplus again. Before we blithely add a sum of this amount to achieve nothing worthwhile, however, we should pause and reflect on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> I will not detain the House much longer on this matter except to make the following point. In recent times this Government has made excellent appointments to the superior courts of this country, on which I congratulate the Minister and his colleagues. It did not need a judicial appointments commission to do so. Putting excellent people on the Bench does not require the establishment of a quango of this kind. Unless it is suggested, or the excuse is, that what is proposed is insurance against a Government of lesser discernment putting less meritorious candidates on the Bench, then this is an entire waste of time and money. The annual increase of €500,000 may seem small in terms of the larger picture but it is the equivalent of adding a very significant amount to the national debt or else not retiring the equivalent amount from our national debt. I very much regret that this wasteful quango is being established and that the office proposed in section 30 will absorb taxpayers' money, which will be thrown away. We have excellent judges, we are appointing excellent judges and we do not need this system to assist the Government in its choice of judges. This Government has shown, as has the Minister, who is the person who proposes individual members to the Cabinet under current procedures, that we are capable of excellence - not merely excellence in terms of stellar lawyers, but also diversity, men and women, people who are top-class lawyers and people who are perhaps not recognised but equally skilful and who have more modest practices. All this is possible without the establishment of this quango.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> The Minister keeps saying that this is an important part of the Government's legislative programme. That is only because one member of the Government thinks it is important. It is not important if we look at it in the broader sense, that excellent appointments can be made and are being made without it. I spent two and a half hours waiting for this debate to begin. The Government had other priorities regarding the House's time. If that is the Government's way of conducting business, it is fine by me. However, if the Bill is regarded as important, the Minister, Deputy Ross, is the only member of his Independent Alliance who regards it as such. The vast majority of Fine Gael people I have met resent this Bill and think it is a waste of time. The great majority of Members in both Houses-----</p>

          <p eId="para_662">I will keep strictly to section 30 and the proposed judicial appointments commission office. It is not proposed to be a physical office because subsection (1) states, "There shall be attached to the Commission an office to be known as the Judicial Appointments Commission Office (in this Act referred to as the "Office") which shall assist the Commission in the performance of its functions." It will obviously be composed of people and will not involve a building or anything of that nature. I wonder about this because we have already had reference to persons, consultants and advisers. Is this office in addition to these or will it consist of those persons, consultants and advisers? What will be the relationship between them? Is this an additional element of personnel? Subsection (2) states, "The Office shall be funded by moneys provided by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform." Should this not be a clear budget? How much is involved? Are there any limits at all on it? It seems very vague.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> Subsection (3) states, "The office shall be under the management and control of the Commission and subject to the direction of the Director." That is pretty bland and is perfectly all right. I have no problem with it at all. Subsection (4), however, states, "The Commission may, with the consent of the Minister given with the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, appoint such and so many persons to be members of the staff of the Office as it may determine." That is enormously wide. It is really swingeing. Listen to it - "such and so many persons to be members of the staff ... as it may determine". One could have thousands of them. It just seems to me to be absurdly wide. Then we have subsection (5), which states: "The terms and conditions of service of a member of staff of the Office shall be determined by the Commission with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform." I presume this is a kind of trade union thing as it refers to the pay and circumstances of employment in the office and so on. That is fair enough. Subsection (6) states, "A member of staff of the Office shall be a civil servant in the Civil Service of the State." How long are they expected to last? Does this concern pension rights? Will they be already covered in terms of secrecy by the Official Secrets Act and so on?</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I have asked a few questions but I have no significant difficulty with the section except for the vagueness of the terminology in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">I will not engage in repetition but I assure Senators this is a Bill that is proceeding through the Houses in accordance with the priority given to it under the programme for Government. It is reforming legislation that will improve, modernise and update the manner in which members of our Judiciary are appointed, bearing in mind the need to honour the Constitution and the independence of those offices. I say that in response to Senator McDowell.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> To Senator Norris, let me repeat that the office will be small and it will be headed by the director appointed by the commission following a selection process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service. The director will have a Civil Service staff of two or three persons. They will be appointed by the commission in accordance with this section. The staffing costs for the support office under this part of the Bill will be for a small number of civil servants and the director. That will be in the region of €300,000, to which will be added non-pay costs, which should bring the annual cost to an estimated €500,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">The Minister has indicated that the proposed appointee would be somebody who would be remunerated at the level of a principal officer in the Civil Service. That is, I suppose, a reasonable salary range to nominate for this position, but if one looks at subsections (2), (3) and (4), then we have a slight difficulty because subsection (2) states: "The Director shall hold office for such period not exceeding 5 years from the date of his or her appointment as the Commission shall determine." The first thing is that we are saying that the director can be appointed for a period of less than five years, which would be a very temporary kind of appointment in the circumstances. If one is going to give somebody a senior position of this kind, I do not see why it should be open to the commission to say it would give someone a couple of years or three years to carry out one's function.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Second, subsections (3) and (4) have the effect of saying that if one is appointed for five years one can be appointed for a second period, not exceeding five years, but the total entitlement to hold the office is ten years. One of the problems with these kinds of temporary appointments is that it seems to me they have the effect of frightening off everybody who is not being seconded from some position in the Civil Service because nobody else in the private sector could apply for a job of such seniority and be effectively told after five years that he or she is gone.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> It seems to me that this is designed to effectively frighten off people who are not already public servants, who might be seconded to act as director of the commission. Bearing in mind the high hopes surrounding the Bill and that we are told this will be a game-changing new institution, I wonder whether in all of the circumstances subsections (2), (3) and (4) are not going to have the effect of frightening away everybody except a career civil servant who will be shifted sideways in and out of the position for such term as the commission suggests.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> Whereas section 31 might on the face of it appear to be a fairly standard provision, in the context of this particular institution I am trying to work out in my own mind what would happen in the event of a lawyer or administrator who was interested in taking up this position. Let us suppose it was a woman or man in her or his 40s or 50s and she or he is given a five-year term with no guarantee of reappointment. Unless one is a public servant, and teachers are one group who can be-----</p>
