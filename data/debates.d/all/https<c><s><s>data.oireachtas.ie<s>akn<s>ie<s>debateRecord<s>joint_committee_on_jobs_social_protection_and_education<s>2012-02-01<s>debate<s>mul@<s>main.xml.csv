I remind members that mobile phones should be turned off.  I understand they have them on to receive emails, but I ask them to at least keep them away from the microphones, as they cause a lot of interference.  Last week there were a lot of complaints from the broadcasting unit, although I admit the problem probably lay more with delegates than members.  I will say it to the delegates when they arrive.  Therefore, mobile phones should be put away for our own benefit.The minutes of the meeting held on 25 January have been circulated.  Are they agreed to?  Agreed.The joint committee went into private session at 9.35 a.m. and resumed in public session at 9.50 a.m.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The joint committee will hear two presentations today.  We will spend approximately one hour on the first of them and slightly less on the second.  We have to finish by 11.45 a.m. because the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, is coming at that time to consider a motion.  I, therefore, ask members to use their time well when asking questions.  I might place a limit of two minutes on contributions to try to give everybody a chance to speak.  We have to make the most of both presentations.

It is good to have her and her team here.  Like other members, I have met some of them before.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If a witness is directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, he or she is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they do not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I invite Ms Coakley to make her presentation which will be followed by a question and answer session.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	3	On behalf of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors, I thank the joint committee for allowing us to come to speak to it about the future of guidance counselling in second level schools.  Guidance counselling is about student welfare.  Guidance counselling is a front-line service which supports students throughout their second level education and into post-leaving certificate level.  It supports students to enable them gain the maximum from their time in the education system.  Guidance consists of a range of learning experiences, delivered in a sequential way along the students' development throughout their time in school.  It assists students to develop self-management skills so that those skills will lead to effective choices and decision-making, not just in school but throughout their lives.  This is the purpose of guidance and counselling in second level schools in Ireland.The importance of guidance and counselling is enshrined in the 1998 Education Act.  Section 9(c) provides that schools must provide access to appropriate guidance.  We are here today to state that without the ex-quota allocation provided for guidance up until this budget, schools will not be in a position to provide access or appropriate guidance for students.The Department of Education and Science which is now the Department of Education and Skills, produced the document which is a guideline to section 9(c) of the Act.  This document shows how guidance should be delivered, based on section 9(c).  It stresses the importance of guidance and describes the research which supports the importance of guidance.  It indicates elements of the programme and the rationale and planning for guidance.  Since the ex-quota allocation was taken away in the budget, this document has no status.  All its aims and objectives are now purely aspirational.The service is envisaged as an holistic service based on the linked areas of educational, vocational and personal guidance.  The range covers everything from subject choice for future decision-making to personal counselling which enables and empowers students.  The school guidance counsellor is the only trained mental health professional to whom students have direct access on a one to one basis.  When one considers the importance of mental health and the various government initiatives to support mental health, school is a very central place for such help to be available.  The guidance counsellor supports the student with mental health issues throughout his or her time in school.The document also refers to vocational or careers guidance.  All the information and options are available for students to make career and educational choices as are all the forms which require to be filled out to make those progressions.I will offer some examples of how guidance and counselling works in schools.  Here is a case in point.  Sally first comes to the attention of the guidance counsellor when she enters school; in fact, she comes to the attention of the guidance counsellor before she enters school because the guidance counsellor plays a central role in helping Sally to make the transition from primary to secondary level and in particular, she helps her in choices having regard to whether they match her interests and her aptitudes at that stage.  This is the work of the guidance counsellor.  The guidance counsellor develops a relationship with the student in the early stages of her coming into school in order for her to settle into school.  Sally continues through first year and into second year.  She makes good progress, and settles in and everyone is pleased with her progress.  However, at the end of second year, Sally comes to the attention of the pastoral care team.  The guidance counsellor plays a central role in the pastoral care team.  Students experiencing difficulties, for whatever reason, are discussed by the team and any interventions are decided upon.  It has been noted by her class teachers and by her tutors that her performance and her work is falling off.  She is not as focused as before and she has become withdrawn.  She is no longer hanging around with her friends.  She seems to have lost weight or it could just be that she is growing up.  The intervention decided upon is that Sally should see the guidance counsellor and her tutor makes an appointment for her.  From the point of personal counselling, the guidance counsellor is the one person in the school whom Sally can see on a one to one basis and confidentially if necessary.  During the sessions with the guidance counsellor, Sally reveals that things are going badly at home, Mum and Dad are splitting up.  She is upset and she is not sleeping at night, she is unable to focus.  She knows her work is suffering and she does not mean for her work to suffer.  She does not want to fall out with the teachers and it is difficult for her to speak about it with her friends.  As a result of personal counselling with the guidance counsellor, Sally can be helped to cope with these issues and to resolve some of them.  The guidance counsellor can also act as an advocate for Sally with the teachers so that they understand some of the circumstances as they do not need to know everything.  This can also be done with the parent.I have another example.  Joe is a completely different kettle of fish.  He is in fifth year.  He is the life and soul of the school.  He is bright, bubbly and an extrovert.  He is a great athlete and footballer.  He is a very bright boy with a slightly cavalier attitude towards school and education in general.  In fact, he revealed to the guidance counsellor when picking his subjects for fifth year that he only did transition year because of the variety of activities available.  He believes he can leave school at any stage and get an apprenticeship.  The guidance counsellor has a lot of contact with Joe during fifth year and Joe begins to reveal that the apprenticeship he had in mind is no longer on the horizon.  His Dad works in construction and Dad is now on short time and he might be let go.  Neither Mum nor Dad has completed second level education.  Dad keeps talking about the need for qualifications and a good job.  It is dawning on Joe that he must make sense of the education world, a world with which he is completely unfamiliar and with which his family background has no links.  Joe needs extra help from the guidance counsellor as he goes through the guidance programme in fifth year and into sixth year in order to match his aptitudes to courses leading to qualifications which will ensure sustainable employment.  Joe is a bit unsure of himself for the first time.  He wonders what college will be like and he is curious about what it means to be a professional.  Joe requires extra one to one guidance.  Because of family background, living in a disadvantaged area on a low income, with parents who have not completed their education, Joe is eligible for the higher education access scheme or any of the other individual access schemes available in colleges.  With Joe's permission, the guidance counsellor also contacts Mum and Dad and offers assistance if required in negotiating the amount of paperwork they will need to deal with in order for Joe to make the transition from second level education to further or third level education.  He can then make a contribution to the economy and achieve a successful life for himself.  These are just two examples of how the guidance and counselling service works within schools.As to the future, I question what will happen if there is no ex-quota dedicated allocation for guidance and counselling in schools.  The Minister has referred in his speech to the fact that 450 posts will be gone from second level education.  Guidance and counselling will bear the brunt of this because the ex-quota allocation must be found from within the general allocation.  It is now down to the management of the school to find the hours for guidance and counselling.  For example, if a school has an enrolment of between 500 and 599 students, it is entitled to 24 hours per week guidance and counselling.  This is the equivalent of a full post plus two hours.  A DEIS school is entitled to 27.5 hours.  How will the school find those extra hours?  The guidance counsellor is back in the general allocation and this means that the guidance counsellor, as of next September, will be back in class teaching subject areas.  It is up to the school management to decide between guidance service or subject teaching.  From 29 February, some schools will not have a guidance counsellor if that person retires.  As of next September, all schools will be over the quota.  If a school does not have a guidance counsellor it cannot hire one.  When the school is in a position to hire a guidance counsellor, either through natural wastage or because the numbers have risen, it is back to the dilemma of which service or subject to choose.      Schools in areas where they nearly have to compete for enrolments with other schools have to keep their curricular commitments in mind.We have discussed this matter with the managerial bodies, which have already advised schools to do an audit of where they stand in relation to staffing and subjects.  I will give an example of what has happened in the last two weeks.  A large school in the north east initially had an allocation of 38 hours, according to the schedule.  It got extra hours some years ago as a result of the guidance enhancement initiative.  Every minute of its 49 hours was being used for guidance and counselling purposes.  The principal of the school has done an audit to try to find hours during which guidance can be provided.  After looking upside down and inside out, she has come up with ten hours.  I am sure members can tell the difference between a ten-hour service and a 49-hour service.  The principal will have to decide who will receive the service and how it will be delivered.  How can the school ensure there is access to appropriate guidance?  Will this measure leave schools open to litigation from students or parents who feel that access to appropriate guidance and support was denied to them?I would like to speak about the evidence that supports the need for-----
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	4	As our time is limited, Ms Coakley might wish to get to her main points.  She has another two minutes.  I want to involve the members as well.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Research that has been done by the ESRI and Forfás and the guidance inspection reports indicate that we have a quality service.  That service belongs in schools because that is where students benefit most from it.  Students require this service.  The research suggests that more guidance is needed, particularly at junior certificate level.  More one-to-one guidance is also required.EU policy is that these services should be provided.  Ireland signed up to Council of Europe resolutions in 2004 and 2008, which refer to the development of managerial skills as a necessary literacy alongside all the other literacies.  Such skills allow students to make the transition into education, stay in education and transfer out of education.  If we do not provide guidance and counselling services, we will deny our students a basic literacy.The best example of the success of guidance and counselling can be found in Finland.  An allocation is made there.  Finnish guidance counsellors must be professionally trained.  The holistic service that is provided in Finland covers all aspects of vocational, personal and career guidance.  It plays an important part in the delivery of mental health initiatives and education in that country.  Guidance counsellors in Finland provide the guidance and counselling service.  They have access to psychologists to whom they can refer students.  That can happen in a case of severe need.I suggest that some Irish students will not receive any guidance in the future.  The guidance that will be given will not be governed by a standard and will not be uniform.  That is unacceptable for our young people.  I thank the committee for its attention.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank Ms Coakley and her colleagues for their presentation.  The pack they have provided to us contains a great deal of valuable information.  I will not delay the meeting as I have had an opportunity to speak on this issue in the Dáil on a number of occasions.  The Minister has said that the Department will issue a new circular on the implementation of section 9 of the Education Act 1998.  Does Ms Coakley know whether that has been issued yet?  According to the Minister, some 42% of second level schools do not have a full-time dedicated professional guidance counsellor.  My understanding is that a school with 200 enrolments is allocated six hours for career guidance.  If there are more students in the school, an increased amount of time is allocated.  Do I understand correctly that the overwhelming majority of schools can avail of the services of a professionally trained guidance counsellor on a shared or part-time basis?  The career guidance counsellor might be teaching another subject as well.One of the examples given by Ms Coakley related to two or three students.  A friend of mine recently returned to the classroom as the deputy principal of a second level girls' school.  She had been working elsewhere for approximately four years.  She told me that the disciplinary problems she encounters do not arise in the classroom, but are caused by pupils bringing family problems with them to school.  That dovetails with the examples that were given by Ms Coakley in her presentation.  The experienced teacher to whom I refer has told me that without the professional services of her school's career guidance counsellor, the competence would not exist in her staff room to deal with the complex issues that many of our secondary school students are having to face.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I agree with Deputy Smith that schools have become far more complex places as society has increased in complexity.  Schools have to deal with societal problems.  One cannot expect a student to leave whatever is on his or her mind outside the door when he or she is participating in education.  All members of staff provide support to students.  The pastoral care team can bring issues to the attention of those who need to deal with them.  The guidance counsellor is the only professional in the school in the sense that no one else has a professional qualification in the field of guidance and counselling.  The guidance counsellor cannot exist in a vacuum, however.  We work with the pastoral care team, our teaching colleagues and the school management to provide a whole-school guidance programme.  We identify issues that are appropriate for being dealt with under the social, personal and health education programme.  Issues that emerge from social, personal and health education classes can be passed onto guidance counsellors.  If a year head or tutor identifies a student who is having particular difficulties, and the normal disciplinary approaches are not having much of an effect, the student can be referred to the guidance counsellor to see whether further support can be offered.The Minister has said that 42% of schools do not have a full-time professional guidance counsellor.  That may be so.  Up until now, the schedule set out in the circular made an allocation of hours on the basis of the number of students in a school.  The allocation does not increase in even increments.  A school would need to have 500 enrolments in order to have a full-time guidance counsellor.  Some schools with fewer than 500 enrolments benefitted a couple of years ago from the guidance enhancement initiative, which promoted science in secondary schools and helped students to make the transition from primary school.The circular mentioned by Deputy Smith has not been issued yet, unfortunately.  We made a submission to the effect that the circular should preserve and guarantee an entitlement to service under section 9(c) of the 1998 Act.  We said the circular should allocate hours for the students in a school on the basis of the size of that school.  If that is not done, the arrangements will be unworkable.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Yes.  Students who come from areas that are designated as disadvantaged, and whose schools therefore have disadvantaged status, present with different scenarios.  I work in such a school.  I remind the committee of the case of Joe that I mentioned.  A person from that type of background will have a different attitude to, and limited information on, matters like higher and further education and the world of work.  If a student is depending on his or her family, community and friends for advice, he or she will receive advice that is based on their experience.  If they have had a narrow and limited experience, through no fault of their own, that will have an impact on the student.  Disadvantaged students will suffer greatly as a result of the reduction in the provision of the guidance and counselling service in schools.  As the service diminishes, the need for it will grow and it will be delivered privately.  That is what we think will happen.  That is okay for middle-class families who can afford it, but what about families who cannot afford it?  These cuts will increase the divide between the haves and the have-nots.  When a young person goes to a private guidance counsellor, he or she will usually see the counsellor once or twice and get a report on that basis.  The private service does not offer a continuum of support as the student progresses through school.  A student does not have to see the guidance counsellor continually.  He or she can pop into the counsellor to check something out or get information.  That continuum of support means students can be assured that somebody is there when they need something.  We help the students in that respect.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Ms Coakley said that public surveys conducted by the ESRI, Forfás and the National Guidance Forum suggest that more time, rather than less, should be provided for career guidance in schools.  At the same time, the 2012 budget will cut career guidance services with a requirement for schools to implement the relevant section of the Act.  The Minister says that schools are statutorily obliged to provide this service.  If guidance counsellors are no longer regarded as ex-quota, how many guidance counsellors will take the retirement package?  What is the age profile of guidance counsellors?  What will happen to those in training to be guidance counsellors?  The website, euobserver.com, has suggested that in Ireland there is one job vacancy for every 50 people unemployed.  The figure in Germany is three vacancies for every person unemployed.  This must be as a result of some of the money we are paying to bondholders which is a help to Germany’s economy.  Last week, Michael Taft referred to a ratio of 26:1.  There must be even more of a demand for guidance counsellors to help students choose a career path.  This is the difficulty we have with this budget cut.  Decisions must be made about a career path or further education.  What can this committee do to help safeguard the position of guidance counselling in schools?  The Minister is on a path and he suggests the onus will be on the schools to supply this guidance.  How can this gap be filled?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I could not agree more with Deputy Crowe.  Students need more guidance and counselling than ever in order that they can find the correct match to their own aptitudes and skills and be open to the jobs of the future and jobs in the knowledge economy.  They need help in making the transition from second level education into training opportunities or further and higher education which will lead to growth in the economy.  Any mismatch will result in a further drain on the economy, with increased drop-out rates and more expense for those who need to repeat.  The statistics which Deputy Crowe requires are being gathered.  We will know at the end of February how many guidance counsellors have left.  As yet, the Department of Education and Skills cannot provide a breakdown of those figures.The directors of training in the universities have committed that guidance and counselling courses will continue to be available.  Over the past two years, almost all the graduates, a total of 80 to 100, have found employment.  However, those working in second level are initially employed on a temporary contract and would not receive a contract of indefinite duration until the fourth year.  Any graduate in the past three years working in a school which is over quota, will not have a contract and could well be let go.  Schools which may have employed a new energetic guidance counsellor in the past three years may well lose that person.As regards the age profile of the profession, the current cohort of guidance counsellors is older so I would expect more retirements in the next couple of years in spite of the disincentives to retirement currently in the public sector.  If the Minister says he supports our students in schools and he wishes to achieve reform, how will these reforms be supported?  Students will need supports in the transition to these reforms and education will need to become more progressive to develop the student who is incapable of independent learning and the student capable of critical thinking.  I am not sure where the Minister can get the funding for the measure but the measure is essential.  It will result in the diminution rather than the improvement of the educational experience for students.  At a time when we are on the cusp of educational reform, this is a very regressive move.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I thank Ms Coakley for her presentation.  What she has told us is alarming with regard to the examples of the two pupils.  Such examples will become the norm, especially considering our society.  They reflect the difficulties for many of our fragile and vulnerable pupils and such difficulties are becoming more common.  We are going against best international practice.  We have come a long way since the 1960s when there was no career guidance or counselling in schools.  It is difficult to fathom how the system that has been built up will be reduced to such a low level.  This will pose particular problems for every school.I refer to correspondence from the Kerry educational service which states that this measure is contrary to the policy on guidance of the Department of Education and Skills.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	13	We need questions at this stage, please, Deputy.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The DEIS inspectorate recommended in two whole-school evaluations in the past two years in Kerry that arrangements should be made for guidance to be delivered by a qualified guidance counsellor.  Therefore, this measure ties the hands of school principals.  There is a need to revisit this matter as it is a serious issue and the committee will need to give it more thought in order to bring forward solutions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Guidance counsellors have an extra qualification compared with other members of staff.  If that expertise is available to a school, I question why it should be wasted.  It is ready and waiting to be used and now it will go to waste and students will be the ones to suffer.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I have found this presentation to be very educational.  I had assumed almost until I read the submission that guidance was solely to do with career guidance but the story of Sally explained to me the much wider concept than I had previously imagined.  This day last week I was in Drogheda where six schools get together to provide a career guidance session.  The meeting was attended by 600 students and a couple of hundred parents.  There were at least 50 stands providing advice.  The Seanad had a debate on education yesterday.  It is fairly clear that the Minister will not be getting extra money.  As in Drogheda, could guidance counsellors come together in a town to share their advice with other schools?  For example, if the number of guidance counsellors in a town is to be reduced, is there a possibility of sharing the counselling service in order that students can be given advice from guidance counsellors in another school?  At a time of financial constraint, it appears unlikely there will be money available.  Would a solution be to share or combine with other schools to provide the service?
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Any cut in the education budget will hurt.  The constraint under which we operate is that 77% of the education budget - pay and pensions - is protected under the Croke Park agreement, and I support this agreement.  If class sizes are to be protected, it is a case of how to make other savings.  Anything that is touched will be difficult.  I met a number of guidance counsellors and have tried to identify alternative funding for the €9 million spent on chaplains.  In DEIS schools, there has been a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 18.25.  However, some DEIS schools say they will not be able to absorb the change in the guidance counselling system with that reduction.  Do the delegates agree?  That was the motivation behind it.Regarding the overall service provided by guidance counsellors, I refer to a letter from Gay + Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, supporting the Institute of Guidance Counsellors' position.  How bad is homophobic bullying, is it getting worse and how are guidance counsellors addressing the issue?  This is not necessarily related to the main topic but I ask for a brief response on how it is being addressed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Regarding Senator Quinn's point, guidance counsellors co-operate with the careers event to which he referred.  We have 17 branches throughout the country and the guidance counsellors of a particular area come together and host careers events and careers exhibitions every year.  We also work on CPD for guidance counsellors in their individual practices.  There is room for co-operation and guidance counsellors are sometimes shared between two schools in a VEC.  All the co-operation in the world will not substitute for service on the ground.  When students come to a career fair, they get information and they can discuss it with someone.  The students needs help to make sense of that and the guidance counsellor needs to check in with an individual on how much sense the individual is making of it.  Whether the individual is going into a tunnel or keeping options open is a matter for the professional on the ground.  This is opening the door wide for guidance counsellors to set up a private practice and I am sure they will be inundated every weekend.  It is not the same as it would be in school where there is someone to approach.  We co-operate and we combine information evenings with events for parents and a number of parents can come together to get the information they need.  We discuss this with the National Parents Council Post-primary.In response to Deputy Ó Ríordáin, the DEIS school of 500 will have a minimum of 27.5 at the moment.  The 0.75 increase by the Minister is the equivalent of one post in a school of 500.  One post is the equivalent of 22 hours so, even if the extra allocation for DEIS was used entirely for guidance counselling, there would be a shortfall of 5.5 hours in that school.  Members might consider that not bad compared to no service but there would still be a shortfall.  DEIS schools may already have a guidance enhancement initiative, which is an additional 11 hours.  That school will lose 16 hours.  The DEIS provision cannot substitute for what exists at present.  There is no stipulation from the Minister that the extra allocation to DEIS schools in this budget should be used for anything in particular or, specifically, for guidance and counselling.  Other support areas will look to make inroads into the extra allocation.  That is how the DEIS schools are affected.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I am the vice president of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors.  Following up on Senator Quinn's point, providing information at career events is one aspect but there is a 32-page application form for students who wants to take the higher education access route, HEAR.  There is an 18-page application form for students applying for the disability access route.  Without one-to-one attention with a guidance counsellor, that will not happen.  Schools are busy places and staff do not have the time or expertise to facilitate students in the completion of application forms.  The guidance counsellor is part of a school team and has a guidance plan, which is delivered in co-operation with other members of staff such as year heads, learning support people and deputy principals.  It is a collaborative effort but the key person driving the delivery of the guidance plan is a professionally trained guidance counsellor.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The second matter referred to by Deputy Ó Ríordáin was homophobic bullying.  Guidance counsellors have been to the forefront in tackling this issue in schools.  We had discussions with GLEN on how to do this and came up with guidelines for guidance counsellors, ways of highlighting it and ways of tackling it.  The National Centre for Guidance in Education produced these guidelines for guidance counsellors and brought in management to discuss how schools could tackle it.  It remains a problem but is becoming less of a problem.  Students who may be victims of homophobic bullying know that the guidance counsellor is there if they need to talk to someone.  Collaborating with tutors, SPHE and the whole schools, education is available to students on gay and lesbian issues.

I have met my local guidance counsellors and I was very impressed with their presentation.  One of them presented me with a letter from pupils who were upset to lose their guidance counsellor.  The ESRI and the OECD have recommended that we have guidance counsellors.  We are in a constrained situation because we have no money and our country is bankrupt.  That is the bottom line.  I have serious concerns about young people.  I am aware of two students who had no money and could not apply to the CAO.  The guidance counsellor in the school made sure the money was made available and counselled the young people.  There are 700 pupils in that school and at any given time, the guidance counsellor has ten young people queueing outside the room to speak to her.  I do not know what to say to the delegates.  The Minister has made the decision.  We are in government and we must put the country first and fix it.  That is the bottom line but I really appreciate the work of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I pay tribute to the work guidance counsellors do.  When the Minister spoke, he asked the institute to meet the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.  The Institute of Guidance Counsellors will have to make the same argument to principals.  I was a primary school principal and I know that parents will inform the principals about the importance of guidance counsellors.The delegates talked about the pastoral team.  Are they ex quota or within the quota?  How is it managed?  My children have gone through secondary school and, to be honest, I heard more about year heads, deputy principals and assistant principals.  I wonder how these elements of the school staff work.  Guidance counsellors used to be ex quota but will now be within the quota and will find major difficulty.  How come the principal sees the importance of the group of year heads, deputy principals and assistant principals but guidance counsellors are afraid that principals will not see the importance of guidance counsellors?I fundamentally disagree with my colleague when he says that a chaplaincy should not have a place in secondary schools.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	26	That is not an issue for today.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Allow Mr Flynn to answer the question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	31	We also had a meeting with the managerial bodies.  They told us we are trying to divvy up a smaller cake to provide all the services, which is not possible.  We will continue to work because we believe in the service and how essential it is for students in our care.Pastoral care teams involve subject teachers and it is an additional duty.  A pastoral care team might meet during one period a year.  It brings items to the concern of the team and refers identity appropriate professionals within schools.  They are not ex-quota.  Guidance counsellors are the only people who are professionally trained to deal with the issue.  I speak as someone who is chairperson of a board of management in a school.  My concern is that there could be potential litigation in future from someone providing inappropriate advice because he or she was not professionally qualified.  Such a situation would expose a board and school to potential litigation.  There are some very serious issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I will ask Ms Nic Sheanlaoich to address Deputy McFadden's points.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I would like to discuss how the country should deal with budget constraints.  In 1982 and 1983 there were serious cuts and at that time there was an allocation of one guidance counsellor to 250 students, ex-quota.  It was changed immediately to a ratio of one to 500 students.  Other cuts happened at the time.  A comment used by a colleague at the time was that we were using the children of the country as collateral.  If we cannot afford this service, our young people will suffer the consequences.We are seeing young people in personal crises, trying to deal with difficult applications and trying to find their way to a career.  Even some exceptionally well-qualified students who are very bright but, because of financial constraints, are having difficulty preparing for their future will suffer.  If the country wants that, this is the right way to go about it.  We would not recommend such an approach.We are dealing with five or ten students queueing outside our doors.  Sometimes three or four students are trying to make an appointment for a variety of issues such as school refusal, mental health issues, grief, bereavement, parents separating, eating disorders and self harm.  These issues come on top of all the other subject choices, possible career options and work experience.  We do not know what is coming in our door from one minute to the next.  These are all real issues for the students we are dealing with every day.  They will lose out and be used as collateral against the Government's debt.  That is not what the people want.  It is not what parents want.  Parents are telling us they cannot manage without the service.
#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I welcome the delegation.  I have great admiration for the work it does.  I taught for about 35 years.  Every individual teacher considered himself or herself a guidance teacher. I remember the principal in the first school I taught was sharp in his reminder to teachers who thought otherwise.One thing which made a significant difference was the creation by the City of Dublin VEC of an after-school psychological service, similar to what Senator Quinn described.  There was a central resource in a place called Winstead in Rathgar.  All the qualified guidance counsellors could come into schools if there were particular needs or requirements.  I found pupils very readily approached individual teachers because they knew them and had built up a relationship in the classroom with them, which was a very big plus.Things have changed now, but sometimes career guidance counsellors are seen as very remote figures sitting in offices.  Their disposition has changed.  I am speaking from experience.  The issues and problems young people presented with were not neglected and were dealt with.  Groups of teachers talked about individual students who came to them.  Knowledge was shared.As some of my colleagues have said, ideally we would not like to see the work of guidance counsellors being diminished and their professional status being in any way undermined, but we are in far from ideal circumstances.  We have to do more with less.  We must find ways of being smarter with the resources we have.  Individual teachers and guidance counsellors have huge resources and we must find ways of utilising those resources in a smarter way for a period of time until the more ideal situation returns.
#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I agree with a lot of what Deputy Conaghan said.  I thank the delegation.  As someone who has worked as a secondary school teacher for about 13 years, in many ways I am all too familiar with the potential of guidance counselling.It would be wrong of me just to be positive.  The room has been full of positive comments, and rightly so.  It should be full of the professional work guidance counsellors do.  I would be wrong if I did not say there are examples where one must question the role of guidance counsellors in particular schools.  That has not been said here today.  I do not want a response but I wanted to mention it.  If we had enough time for everyone to speak about their experience of guidance counselling in schools, I am sure it would vary greatly.  I say that with no disrespect to the delegation and those in the profession who do more than they are paid for.  I know of that side but I wanted to let people know about the other side.Like more recent commentators have said, the reality is we are in a tough space and the delegation knows that.  It does seem that the service is taking a hit.  Some absorption measures have been put in place.  Other services are available.  We need to consider solutions.  Deputy McFadden mentioned a letter which outlined why we should not have the guidance counselling service removed.  Autonomy has been given back to principals and they need to address some of the issues raised today.  They have a remit to offer guidance counselling services.  I would like to think if they believe guidance counselling services are worthwhile they would reflect it as much as possible in the allocation they give over the coming years.I want to focus on solution-based issues.  Many schools use integrated resources from external forces.  For example, some schools avail of counselling services through the school completion program.  The National Behaviour Support Service has provided an additional allocation of teachers to some schools to deal with some of the social and emotional issues.  In terms of the more formal sector of the education sector and progression into third level, there are many good examples where local area based partnerships are using their local education officers to deal with CAO applications.  I am not saying that is how things should be.  Circumstances are really tough.  While I acknowledge what is happening, there are other ways of proceeding that we need to consider.  I wish we could turn around and retain existing resources, but we need to consider other approaches in these tough times.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	36	In the context of the very difficult budget and choices being made across all Departments, the Minister for Education and Skills had to make certain choices within his budget and remit.  I met guidance counsellors a couple of weeks ago in Skerries and was certainly impressed by the case they made.  The case the institute is making today is the one they made to me.  If the institute's representatives were not present today, we could well be talking to another group which could have been hit.  Does Ms Coakley accept that, in the context of the difficult education budget, savings had to be made generally?  I am not in any way putting down the institute in asking whether there are other areas within the education framework in which savings could have been made and which were missed by the Minister completely.  Do the delegates believe there is some low-hanging fruit he could go after on the next occasion?
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I, too, have had a lot of contact with guidance counsellors and they have been to see me.  I am familiar with the very important work they do.  I have been disturbed by some comments made by the institute's former president, Mr. Brian Mooney, whose knowledge I respect.  He stated cuts to guidance counselling services would lead to an increase in youth suicides.  I do not know of any causal link between the provision of a guidance counsellor and the prevention of youth suicide.  What is Ms Coakley's view , given that I accept guidance counsellors have a unique skill set?As others have said, the Education Act stipulates that a school must still provide a guidance counsellor service.  This puts it up to the principal to protect the service.  It is a teacher cut in a different form.  We are not actually hearing all that could be heard from the teachers whose jobs may be cut because the guidance counsellor has to be protected within a school.  Will Ms Coakley comment on this?With regard to solutions, Ms Coakley is correct that it is a case of matching a child with a course or possible career.  This could prevent a student from dropping out of college early, which problem has a price.Counsellors counsel on personal issues such as truancy, deviancy, etc.  Does the delegation see merit in considering increments above certain salary levels to save the valuable guidance service?
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	38	We have about five minutes in which to wrap up.  It is important that some solutions are highlighted by the delegates because we will be making suggestions to the Minister after today's meeting.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Let me refer to some of the points raised by the last three Deputies.  The Minister claims he will save €32 million.  This is a very small price to pay for retaining the existing level of service for students.  Students deserve the €32 million.  I cannot say from where the Minister can get the money; I do not have access to the information he has available.  All I know is the consequence of what he is doing.Deputy John Lyons referred to rationalisation and external services.  It has been proved that external services in schools are far less effective than those based in them.  Partnership services come in at CAO stage.  What happens prior to that stage is more important than what happens during it.  The services are very busy in their local communities and many have taken hits.  I know guidance counsellors employed by the services who are now seeking positions elsewhere.I could not agree more with the point on guidance counsellors who are not up to scratch.  There are mechanisms to deal with every such employee.  There is a variety of reasons anybody in the education sector may be underperforming.  There are mechanisms available to management to ensure employees deliver to students the service they are employed to deliver.  Achieving this is but the proper use of public funds.On Senator Fidelma Healy Eames's points, every individual is entitled to his or her opinion.  The statement made by the individual in question on suicide does not reflect the opinion of the institute.  We do not believe getting involved in an emotive debate or using emotive language will help the cause in any way.  We would not want to be seen to be exploiting students in any way either.  We have all heard of suicides in our schools and intervened on occasion in regard to suicide ideation.  None us can forecast whether a case will become a suicide statistic in the absence of intervention.  It is a fact that we have all dealt with the issue of suicide ideation, but we do not claim that we can prevent all suicides.On the point that management must deal with the problem presented by the cuts, Ferdia Kelly of the Joint Managerial Body states, "It is not acceptable for the Minister to suggest that the decision as to the allocation of teaching resources in a school lies with school management."  Irrespective of the Minister's view on devolving power and decision-making capacity to schools, he should have a conversation with managerial bodies on how this devolution will work in practice.  To give somebody power and responsibility at the same time as taking resources from him or her is totally unacceptable.  It is like telling Derval O'Rourke that she has qualified for the Olympic Games and then shackling her two ankles together.  How is one supposed to jump the hurdles?  Effectively, that is what the Minister has done.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	41	It is nonsense in a cash-strapped education system to be talking about cutting anywhere.  Talking about cutting teachers' pay is not a solution.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I thank members for their time and attention.  Deputy John Lyons referred to underperforming guidance counsellors.  The institute does not support underperformance.  We have spent considerable time and resources on continuing professional development to up-skill our members.  We have worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills to provide supervision for guidance counsellors to ensure best practice.  Therefore, our role as a professional body is to continue to up-skill our members to ensure there is a comprehensive and professional service available.  That this may not have obtained in the past is due to a variety of factors, including the amount of time allocated to the provision of the service and the combination of counselling and subject teaching.  There were individuals delivering a guidance service in schools who were not professionally qualified.  There was a range of issues involved.  We will continue to do more to enhance the professionalism of the service.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	46	To come back to the point I made at the beginning, guidance and counselling services are about students.  They are about the quality of education that students experience and added value to the education service.  The proposed measure will ensure no uniformity and no standards across the board.  It will increase the level of disadvantage and have an effect on inclusion and retention in, and transition from, schools.  The economy cannot afford to pay that price.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	47	On behalf of committee members, I thank the delegates for their presentation.  It was a useful discussion.  We will be in touch with the Minister.  He was present last week to discuss the issue.  We talk about a range of issues at this committee.  Naturally, we will focus on what the delegates have said today, but the circular will also be very important, certainly in the shorter term.  We will work on it also.  I again thank the delegates for their contributions and we will be in touch with them again.  No doubt this topic will feature for a while and we will keep working on it.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The second session is a discussion with representatives of the modern languages in primary schools initiative, MLPSI, on the proposed abolition of the initiative..  We have a number of speakers but the main spokesperson is Ms Tanya Flanagan, the national co-ordinator of the programme.Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.By virtue of section 17(2) (l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I hope that does not scare anyone.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I thank the Chair.  It is my role today to introduce everyone.  I am chairperson of the Kildare Education Centre which hosts the initiative.  I would like to introduce the team but first I thank the committee for allowing us to attend the meeting.  I look forward to the interaction with the committee.On my immediate left is Ms Dolores Hamill, director of the Kildare Education Centre.  Beside her is Dr. Kenia Puig i Planella, regional adviser to the initiative.  Next to her is Ms Tanya Flanagan, the national co-ordinator.  She will be the main presenter today.  Beside her is Ms Pascaline Horan, another regional adviser to the initiative.  Finally, we have Dr. Deirdre Kirwan, principal of a school in Blanchardstown where the initiative has been extremely successful.I will preface the presentation by saying that we believe the proposal to abolish the initiative is ill-advised.  That is not the way it should be.  It is a highly effective and efficient programme, and one that is extremely popular among students.  It makes a real difference to the learner, both in the short term, then as a young adult and, critically, as a worker in modern Europe.  Given the recent successes, we are distressed at the possibility that the initiative would be set aside.  I ask Ms Flanagan, the national co-ordinator, to make her oral presentation.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I thank Mr. Halford.  We must end the meeting at approximately 11.45 a.m.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I thank the Chair and members of the committee.  The modern languages in primary schools initiative was first launched as a pilot project in 1998.  Such was its success that it was designated an initiative in 2001.  Our aims are to create a positive attitude towards language learning, to include a variety of schools, to facilitate and support diversification in the languages we teach, and to create links between primary and post-primary schools.  More than 27,000 children in schools throughout the country benefit from the opportunity to learn a modern language, which not only lays the foundation for their language learning within the system but also brings many additional benefits, including enhanced cognitive skills, an openness to new cultures and learning experiences and enhanced literacy skills.The schools originally selected from the 1,300 schools that applied to join the initiative were offered a choice of using their own staff or employing a peripatetic or visiting language teacher.  Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of schools chose to avail of a visiting teacher with the result that in the early years of the initiative, 80% of teachers involved were visiting teachers.  There are currently 545 schools teaching Italian, Spanish, German or French to senior pupils and, where staff capacity permits, to other class groups as well.  As all schools joining the project in recent years must have staff capacity to deliver the programme, this, together with our efforts to build language capacity within the system, has brought us to a point where 56% of teachers involved are staff teachers and there is no additional cost to the Department as they deliver the programme as part of their normal work.As the decision has been predicated on policy, let us turn for a moment to the current languages policy context obtaining in this country.  The Department sought advice on the formulation of a national languages and education policy.  While recommendations and action points were received from the Council of Europe in 2008, work on this is still ongoing.  As such, all language teaching and learning operates within a current language policy vacuum.  In his correspondence, the Minister referred to the influence of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, feasibility report from 2008 and its conclusion that curriculum overload is an issue.  The same report refers specifically to how the participating schools managed to overcome the challenges of time, widely articulated in the primary curriculum review.  It also highlights that in schools offering a third language, Irish and English were reported to have gained.  While it did not include modern languages in the curriculum in 2008, it clearly reiterated that the options proposed did not preclude schools continuing with a competency model of language teaching and learning.  There are many more positive references to the MLPSI in the feasibility report rather than the narrow interpretation being reflected.  The NCCA itself indicated surprise that this "very dated report is being cited in such narrow terms".It would be of more relevance for the committee to focus on the NCCA's current language policy which has evolved considerably since 2008.  A focus of the NCCA's current programme of work is the development of a new integrated languages curriculum for all languages for all children which will embrace a more plurilingual approach to languages.  It recently commissioned additional research in this area from Pádraig Ó Duibhir and Jim Cummins to be completed in the coming weeks.  As we await the publication of a national languages and education policy, the NCCA believes there is much to be learned from the MLPSI and that this experience and expertise will be valuable to the education system in the context of future policy decisions.The modern languages in primary school curriculum is completely in line with the primary school curriculum.  Modern languages lend themselves particularly well to integration right across the curriculum while also being a valuable vehicle which allows teachers to address issues such as culture, heritage, citizenship and inclusion in a natural and holistic way.We assure the committee that we are mindful of the need to enhance literacy levels in the system but it is important to note, as has been tested by our schools and independent evaluation reports, that modern language provision has made a positive contribution to literacy in schools, in particular in disadvantaged areas.Having spoken about this country, I would like to allude briefly to developments in language policy across Europe.  These have happened at a much more significant rate in other jurisdictions, largely due to commitments made under the Lisbon strategy in 2000 and further detailed in the Barcelona agreement from 2002 which committed member states to take action to "improve the mastery of basic skills, particularly to teaching at least two foreign languages from a very early age".  Many countries have introduced more than one additional language to their primary systems, and schools are introducing them to pupils at an earlier age.  The MLPSI allows this country to work towards fulfilling obligations in the future when it is to be hoped all children will be able to learn more languages, as they can in other countries.  If modern language provision ceases, regrettably we will see a return to the situation which prevailed prior to 1998 when the only children with multilingual skills in this country were those from multilingual families and those who could afford to pay for the privilege.  In many ways, the decision to end the MLPSI comes at a time when there has never been as much momentum behind the languages agenda in educational and economic terms.  This brings me to the fundamental importance of language learning for the Irish economy.  The OECD now refers to the term "international competence" as a combination of languages and intercultural skills which employees will need to compete in the jobs market of today and tomorrow.  IBEC, Forfás, the expert group on future skills needs, the IDA, the Royal Irish Academy and even the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation as well as economists and industry leaders have all highlighted the language skills deficit in this country which affects not only indigenous companies wishing to capitalise on export potential but also multinationals which have their European and international bases here.Sustaining early modern language learning will ensure our children have an interest in and a love of languages and will become lifelong learners of language and enjoy enhanced literacy levels as well as the many other benefits associated with an early introduction to modern languages.  The model for modern language provision in its current form delivers exceptional value for money and helps children achieve valuable learning outcomes.  The costs involved have decreased and the MLPSI has been congratulated on its efficient delivery of enhanced services with a decreasing budget.  It is a cost-effective model which gives professional support to 545 principals and almost 500 teachers, of whom more than 200 are employed directly by the programme.  Should the MLPSI end, this investment would be lost to the system and the loss of the significant number of teaching positions would be a source of great regret.In our submission we have outlined possible options for the Department to consider and we are more than willing to discuss these and any other proposals with the Minister and his officials.  I thank the committee members for their attention and we are more than happy to answer any questions or provide clarification on any aspect of our submission.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I thank the delegation for its presentation and the written material provided.  Ms Flanagan referred to enhancing literacy in the system.  What is the positive impact of this programme on disadvantaged schools?  Will the witnesses outline the links between additional language learning and literacy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I will answer on disadvantaged schools.  Approximately 20%, a total of 108, of the cohort of schools involved are disadvantaged schools.  This means a huge percentage of primary DEIS schools, almost 40%, have chosen voluntarily to become involved in the programme and have consistently applied to participate over the past 14 years.  This testifies to the fact that these schools, principals and teachers believe it is hugely valuable.  They would not be there if they did not believe in it.  All DEIS school principals are concerned about literacy.  There will be a strategy for improving literacy, and these principals will be at the forefront of this battle.  They would not want to be involved if it did not benefit the children.From my experience as a teacher in a DEIS band one school in Cork city and from speaking to principals and teachers in the schools I can outline a number of benefits to disadvantaged schools.  By participating in the project these schools and principals feel they counteract the basic inequality that existed pre-1998 when only those who could afford modern languages as an after school extracurricular activity had that choice.  With regard to what it means to the pupils, starting a new subject in fifth class is very exciting for children in DEIS schools.  Many of these children have not experienced success in learning.  Starting a new language enables literacy to be addressed in a new medium.  It is not a case of one against the other, and so long as we pit one against the other we make a mistake.  Contrary to what we believed in the past it has been proven that to address literacy through one language is not necessarily more effective.  When one learns a language one gains a range of cognitive skills, not only skills in literacy.The methodologies employed in the modern languages in primary schools initiative have particularly suited children in DEIS schools because they have emphasised active learning and oral language skills.  Many of these children have become disengaged from what we may call the traditional subjects where greater amounts of writing are required in fifth and sixth classes.  The chance to start anew on a level playing pitch with their peers has been very satisfying for these children and the principals have seen this.Many schools, principals and teachers report enhanced attitudes towards Irish.  It is very difficult sometimes for teachers in disadvantaged schools to engage children in the Irish language because they have inherited, for whatever reason, a negative attitude towards it.  The Irish teachers in the schools, through the continuing professional development they have received in the modern languages in primary schools initiative, have become more excited about teaching Irish by using the methodologies in which they have been trained.According to the 2002 evaluation report by Dr. John Harris, the initiative has made a particular difference to disadvantaged schools, and in general pupils in disadvantaged schools have made as much progress in learning modern languages as pupils in other schools.  This is a unique example of successful learning in disadvantaged schools.  In a direct comparison with any other subject one would not see the same results.

This is what the Minister is signalling.  Where does this leave the 545 schools involved?  Will languages no longer be an option for the pupils in these schools?  We know from research that children are like sponges when it comes to information.  The earlier they get information or learn languages the more chance they have of picking it up.  We are told we are relying on an export-led economy.  I have read some of the documentation submitted and employers such as Google have stressed the importance of languages.  However, we are removing this initiative from the system.  This does not make sense.Who is funding the research to which reference was made?  Is it the Department?  It is important we do this with regard to forming policy because a report has not been done on this since the INTO Quigley report on languages.  It is strange that we are jumping the gun rather than waiting for the research to see how we can roll it out.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I thank Deputy Crowe for his questions.  I will pick up on his points in the order in which he raised them.  At present, 545 schools are involved in the voluntary programme.  I reiterate to committee members that this number in no way reflects the interest in language learning.  When the project was launched more than 1,300 schools applied to join.  As Deputy Crowe stated the timing of this is quite bizarre because there has never been as much interest in language learning and the languages agenda is very much to the fore in education and economics.The budget announcement was supposed to mean that with immediate effect on 31 December the project was to end which left us all in the wilderness because we were not informed on how it would impact directly on schools.  It would mean an end to visiting teachers but, as I stated, a large number of schools involved in the project have the staff capacity to deliver the programme.  Many of the schools involved in the project have the staff capacity to deliver the programme, but we have received no further direction from the Department.  Just before Christmas it clarified that the initiative was to be allowed to continue until the end of the current academic year.  It is in this context that we are attending this meeting to progress the consultations further.The importance of languages in terms of our export markets was mentioned.  In some of our research we came across astonishing data that highlighted the fact that, while there continued to be an emphasis on Brazil, Russia, India and China - the BRIC countries - our exports were performing most strongly in our traditional markets.  CSO data from the first three quarters of 2011 indicated that exports to our traditional markets of France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Switzerland were worth a combined total of €24 billion.The timing is circumspect.  The Royal Irish Academy launched a significant policy document in October entitled, The National Languages Strategy.  One of its main recommendations was that modern languages be mainstreamed in the curriculum and that all children be offered an opportunity to learn an additional language in line with developments throughout Europe.The research alluded to was commissioned by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and carried out by Dr. Pádraig Ó Duibhir of St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, and Dr. Jim Cummins, an Irishman living in Canada who has carried out extensive research in the field of language acquisition.  Given the NCCA's involvement, the funding was departmental.  The NCCA agrees that a considerable amount can be learned from the teaching of modern languages in primary schools initiative, MLPSI, in terms of future policy developments.  Policy work is ongoing.  The Department realised the need to progress the issue and in 2005 invited a delegation from the Council of Europe which consulted widely with all of the partners in the education system on the question of language teaching.  It received a comprehensive report in 2008 that was specific in its recommendations, guiding principles and action points.  Subsequently, the Department convened a working group to progress the issue.  We understand a draft of a national language and education policy was submitted to the Department at some point after this, but it has not been published.  Work is ongoing on the matter.The 1991 INTO report was mentioned.  It was the last national study undertaken, but other research has been commissioned since.  For example, independent evaluation reports were carried out on the initiative in 2002 and 2007 by the Linguistics Institute of Ireland, ITÉ and, latterly, Trinity College Dublin.

We are years behind the Barcelona agreement and the Lisbon Agenda, under which systems were to have been put in place to facilitate the learning of languages.  The minimum requirement was catering for two foreign languages.  Fourteen years of specialty training and an entire structure, including people with expertise, will be lost to the education system.  We must prepare students to compete.  At previous meetings the committee discussed the issues of accessing jobs and mobility, in that there will be great migration within the European Union to acquire work.  Once again, we are at a considerable disadvantage.The Minister has referred to a negative letter sent to the Chairman, dated 17 December.  It is a lame excuse for dropping these subjects.  When a mass of people are being catered for, we must remember the students first.  It has been stated-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Let me pick up on Deputy Tom Fleming's reference to the foundations.  Children will not be fluent after an experience in primary school, but they will have an interest in and a love of languages and a desire to be life-long learners of them.  We are discussing early language learning.  In an Irish context, this occurs at the upper end of primary school when children are aged between ten and 12 years.  However, the process of early language learning has progressed at a far more significant rate in other European countries.  Not only are most of them offering more languages, they are offering them earlier and earlier.  For example, languages are offered in Spain at the age of three years.  Whereas early language learning used to be referred to as the primary context, it is increasingly being referred to as the pre-primary context.  I concur with the Deputy, that we are somewhat behind.

I have a good knowledge of the courses delivered as part of the initiative.  I am a fan of its methodologies, the content of its programmes and how it provides for language teaching in the classroom,  which is done on the cheap at a time when budgets are constrained.The group refers on page 8 of its submission to visiting and staff teachers.  Our guests can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand their budget is approximately €2.5 million.  Visiting teachers come to schools, but, as many of us know, staff teachers would be well able to deliver the programme were they to receive training as part of the initiative.  Will Ms Flanagan comment on what is occurring in the training colleges in terms of teachers being trained on how to teach foreign languages?Ms Flanagan mentioned that she had solutions to offer and asked whether the committee would like to hear them.  I would.  She mentioned that she could reduce the budget, which is what we want to hear.  We are sympathetic to her concerns.
#JohnKelly	unknown-#JohnKelly-party	unknown-#JohnKelly-dob	unknown-#JohnKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I welcome the delegation and compliment Ms Flanagan on her presentation, in which she mentioned retrograde steps.  I tend to agree with her.  Deputy Seán Crowe mentioned Google and the importance of modern languages in business.  Ms Flanagan mentioned the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation which has stated there is a language skills deficit.  We should not lose sight of these matters simply because we are in a certain financial position.We have decided to spend €2.5 million or €2.7 million on literacy and numeracy initiatives and put the MLPSI on the scrapheap.  I had a lovely cup of coffee with four modern language teachers before attending this meeting and we had a good discussion about the issue.  One of them asked me what it would cost the taxpayer.  We would save €2.7 million, but placing 270 people on social welfare payments would cost the taxpayer €5.76 million a year.  When Departments make decisions such as this, they forget about the cost to other Departments.  It is important that the delegation bring this fact to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills in its submission to him and the committee should make sure he knows it.  It should also tell the Minister for Social Protection.  In everything we do it seems there is a lack of joined-up thinking.  We are drawing from the same pot of money.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Ms Flanagan has been asked a couple of questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I will take them in reverse order.  It was always the long-term goal to mainstream languages in the curriculum, as recommended by the Royal Irish Academy as recently as last October.  The primary school curriculum was revised in 1999.  Even though French was not included as a mandatory subject at that point, there are numerous references in the curriculum documents to the need for a review in that regard, given developments at European level.  The long-term goal has always been that all schools in every county should offer this learning opportunity to children.The position of visiting teachers was raised.  We have a large number of visiting teachers who have been involved from the beginning and they have brought an incredible richness to the programme.  Many of them are qualified primary teachers from other jurisdictions who, as well as having the language specialism, also bring a cultural richness to the programme which has been of incredible benefit to the schools involved.  I agree that there has not been widespread research commissioned in this area for many years.  There is incredible staff capacity within the system which could be tapped into to bring this learning opportunity to more schools.Last year we launched, in collaboration with the Italian Cultural Institute, an Italian course for primary teachers with a prior knowledge of the language.  We had no idea how many teachers would apply, given that Italian would not have been our most popular language.  Some 30 teachers enrolled and more are on a waiting list.  There is, therefore, capacity within the system to sustain this project into the future.On the colleges of education, there are 309 students enrolled in the languages departments at St. Patrick's College and Mary Immaculate College which have established French and German departments.  Other colleges have indicated an interest in introducing languages to a greater degree in their programmes.  It is unfortunate that the issue of timing arises continually.  The colleges of education are engaged in a review of their programmes of teacher education.  Members may be aware that all B.Ed programmes are moving from three to four years duration.  The review presented a golden opportunity for colleges to introduce languages, capitalise on the language skills young teachers already possess and ensure all teaching graduates would have a language, thus increasing capacity considerably.On solutions, it is welcome that the Department has prioritised its policy on literacy and numeracy.  However, the point being missed is that literacy is not a monolingual concept.  It does not involve Irish and English alone: there are 167 languages spoken in the primary system.  We see modern language teaching provision as complementing the literacy agenda.  That is where the solution lies.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	68	That is a fair point.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I thank Ms Flanagan for her presentation.  It strikes me, from the discussion she has had with other members thus far, that the literacy and cost arguments do not stand up, given the numbers of disadvantaged schools which have voluntarily taken up the programme.  These schools operate in a challenging environment and their priority is promoting literacy and helping children to read and write, in particular in English.  They obviously believe this programme could be of benefit to them.  I note Ms Flanagan's letter from the principal of the senior school in Darndale which provides a strong endorsement of the programme.  If teachers teaching children with the most challenging literacy problems believe the programme is advantageous, we should be listening to them.On costs, I agree with the comments made by other members, in particular those relating to the futility of putting people on the dole, which is remarkable.  Will visiting teachers who have been involved in the programme for a long time be entitled to redundancy payments or will they be redeployed?  Making people redundant and putting them on the dole will result in greater costs.  I am not sure if the delegates can answer that question, but it strikes me that at issue is whether any savings will be achieved.  As pointed out, we need to focus on the long-term economic benefits.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I thank the delegates for their presentations.  Ms Flanagan may be aware that I am a language enthusiast.  Before our children turned 14 years, we sent them to school in France for one term.  The two girls fell in love with French men at the age of 13 years and are now married to French men.  This means our grandchildren have a French-speaking father and an Irish-English speaking mother.  What impresses me is the ability of three and four year olds to soak up a language.  My four year old grandson who lives in Ireland speaks French and English and attends Spanish classes with his parents.Are there different ways by which we can educate not currently used in Ireland?  I am surprised to hear Ireland is the only country in Europe in which language learning is not compulsory at primary school level.  What are we not doing correctly compared with other countries?  How can the way in which we teach be improved?Another issue is the length of school holidays in Ireland.  Teachers in Japan get 16 days holidays a year.  I gather teachers in Ireland get more days holidays than teachers in any other country in Europe.  Should we be examining the way our students are taught and the number of days holidays in that regard?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	71	The Senator is correct that Ireland is the only European country in which modern language teaching does not form a mandatory part of the curriculum, which is the crux of the issue.  Other countries have prioritised language teaching.  Dr. John Harrison's input to our submission clearly reiterates that countries in even greater dire straits economically than Ireland have continued to prioritise modern language teaching.  Countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal are prioritising language learning as a way out of the economic difficulties we are all experiencing.  They are not all learning English either: they are learning other languages also.  Modern language teaching must become a priority for the Government.  Languages need to be viewed not alone in an educational or economic context but also in a social context.  We need to value languages more.  They are of phenomenal economic benefit to the country not alone in education terms but also in economic terms.One of the testimonials included in our submission is from the Centre for Next Generation Localisation, an academic research body based in DCU.  It is the link between academia and translation and localisation software industries in Ireland.  That industry is worth €680 million to Ireland and employs more than 16,000 people.  It is deeply concerned about this issue because it had envisaged collaboration with us this year in encouraging involvement by more primary schools in the teaching of foreign languages to children.  It believes languages represent a viable career option.I cannot comment on the holidays issue.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I like stirring it up.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	73	However, it is a valid question.  We use holiday time productively.  A large number of our teachers have availed of European funding to attend language courses in France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Italy.  They are using their holiday time very well.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I discussed this issue with Ms Flanagan last night.  I have had first-hand experience of this initiative in the school in which I taught and concur with the comments made about disadvantaged schools.  This has created a level playing pitch.  While previously French lessons were only available in middle-class schools, the average DEIS school now provides this service.  Children of immigrant families in Sweden have a right to learn the language of their parents, whereas in Ireland we are curtailing a modern languages initiative.  The reality is that we do not do languages well, the biggest example being the Irish language.  Given the amount of time spent by teachers training in the instruction of the teaching of the Irish language and teaching it in primary and secondary schools, every leaving certificate student should be fluent in Irish.  However, that is not the case.Similarly, we are well behind the curve in European terms in modern language teaching.  I will not go through a political statement regarding cuts and strains from the economic position, as we have been through it before and spoke about it last night.  The tragedy is we always discuss these issues in the context of cuts and we never have a long-term view of what language learning will be over time.There was a comment on teacher training.  Is there a potential in the six-month period to discuss that long-term strategy and mainstreaming modern languages?  I often get criticised for making the following point.  The two biggest overarching priority value judgments made in Irish education are the Irish language and religion.  If those are mentioned or criticised by us at any stage, we are in for it.  I know this and am a great advocate of the Irish language.  We must have a different view of our priority system and our value judgments in Irish education.  Although what is happening now is regrettable, will it provide a chance to re-evaluate what we do in education and where languages lie in that regard?
#JohnLyonsLab	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-party	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-dob	unknown-#JohnLyonsLab-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I met Ms Hamill and Ms Flanagan last night and it struck me that they were exceptionally enthusiastic about the programme.  It is rare that a group coming to me is solution-based, as they were, and they had proposals on how this could be kept on.  Many groups could take a leaf from their book in that respect.  Will they elaborate on the level of cost of the programme that would allow it to keep running?  Will the witnesses tell the members about some of the ideas for keeping the programme going if funding is an issue?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The costs involved have been very clearly reiterated by a number of colleagues.  The costs involved to start with are very small.  We are delivering exceptional value for money within a very small budget, which has been decreasing for the past number of years due to a variety of reasons, as we have already outlined.  The critical issue on cost is that there is significant potential within the existing budget to cater for even more schools, as all new schools joining the programme must use their own staff to deliver the modern language option, so we could take on more schools within an existing budget.  The potential for enhanced delivery and services, ensuring more children can avail of this opportunity, is there within an already small budget that has things going in the right direction.I agree with Deputy Ó Ríordáin's statement and now is absolutely the time to consider a longer term strategy.  It is regrettable that this decision was taken in the absence of that considered reflection.  As has been mentioned, this is a golden opportunity in some ways.  The colleges of education will not be reviewing their programmes for a long time and this year they will consider the options; they are examining the skills they want our future teachers to have.  I give presentations in the colleges of education every year and after my presentation there is a queue of young teachers waiting to speak to me.  They would all have exceptional language skills, having had to do very well at languages to enter teacher training.  Many people are coming to teaching having had other careers, with some having degrees in languages, particularly through the Hibernia College.There is a significant interest in language learning because these teachers are getting to a market where they are competing for jobs, as there can be several hundred applications for every teaching vacancy.  People are looking for something to make them unique, and they see modern languages as doing so.  They are being snapped up by principals, as they are seen as potential future subject leaders in the area who can drive this at school level.  We would warmly welcome an opportunity for review, which is one of the key points in our submission.  We were not consulted at any stage on this decision, although we have been congratulated by the Department at every review meeting about how well we were managing to deliver our enhanced services within a decreasing budget.I will return to the point about Gaeilge, as we have never seen ourselves in competition with Irish.  People at our schools would testify that they have seen enhanced delivery of the teaching of Irish as well as an enhanced receptiveness to Irish.  Pupils are finally beginning to realise that Irish is a language, rather than being put in a box as something they must learn.  To bring it down to a school level, people may use it as the informal language of the classroom; on Mondays and Wednesdays English might be used, with Gaeilge on Tuesdays and Thursdays and French, German, Italian or Spanish on Fridays.  That is the way we encourage our teachers and schools to operate.We advocate a whole-school approach.  If members went to any of the schools in our project in their constituencies, they would know they operate as trilingual schools.  Ms Kirwan has more than 40 languages in her school and can testify to this.  We see the positive impact on Irish, not just in terms of children learning but also in the teaching of Irish.  With the methodologies and approaches, the integration focus is on ICT, with thousands of resources on our website being used by teachers for Irish.  Some 93% of teachers in our evaluation report stated they had personally benefited from being involved in this programme because they see the impact not just in the context of modern language teaching but in broader teaching.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	81	It must be taken in a broader context.  The estimate in the budget is €2.5 million.  For the past three years that number has been reducing, with factors involved including the moratorium and the fact we do not bring out pay substitute cover for teachers.  All the schools joining have internal capacity and there are no more resource grants for them.  Many savings have already been achieved.  I have figures from the Department but they need to be broken down further.  I can meet members afterwards to go through the costs, which have definitely been reducing.  The model as it stands will not see increased costs because every school comes in at no cost.  We are achieving greater efficiencies, getting more with less, which we all have to do.  We have accommodated this by re-evaluating the strategies for implementing continuing professional development, without which a programme cannot be run.  We have new strategies that are in line with current practice in the professional development service for teachers.We had already built up a cohort of local facilitators to deliver in the evening and we had just been given permission to reinvest some of the savings in using associates, which is the model for use when additional expertise is required, particularly in the language area.  This is not a mainstream activity but it is national, so we must provide a service and support that is available across the country.  To do this, the current thinking is about the use of associates and local facilitators.  The expertise of the team is then expanded, and more is being achieved with less.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I will mention cost as well.  We have all become expert economists lately, although I have taught economics for a number of years.  Economists understand costs slightly differently than accountants.  There may be a bottom line cost of €2 million but this is an investment.  This is the same as building a bridge, which cannot be done for €2.5 million.  This will benefit the economy far into the future.  In particular, if we could fast forward ten years hence, we imagine a more unified Europe with a fiscal union and far greater movement of workers, cultures and so forth.  We need to be better prepared for this.  We have here a highly efficient programme or initiative that we know works.  We have all the elements in place and it is ready to go.  In fact, it is already going and we are now talking about dismantling it.  It makes no economic sense whatsoever.

#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	91	This is a very exciting project, so much so that I regret my children are not availing of it in primary school through the MLPSI.  Mr. Halford has hit the nail on the head at one level.  I have a few questions in this regard.   English is the language of choice for foreign direct investment, for which we are competing with the United Kingdom, in particular.  However, competence in foreign languages is an added value.  How do we compare with the United Kingdom in the teaching of foreign languages?  The economic benefits will accrue to the nation if we can compete favourably in that regard.Ms Flanagan and Ms Kirwan might also respond to my second question.  The teaching of a foreign language, to which Senator Feargal Quinn alluded, complements the teaching of other languages.  This country is committed to the 20 year strategy for the teaching of Irish.  I used to teach at primary level and taught French in fifth and sixth class without the CPD which would have made a big difference to me.  Will the delegates give an example of how one can practically teach a foreign language?  How will it enhance the teaching of Irish?As Ms Flanagan said, we have many teachers with a language in their basic degree in the teacher training colleges.  How does one enhance capacity in the system?  It has been said 56% of schools currently have in-house staff.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	92	It was said 56% of the staff involved were school-based.

#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I thank the group for appearing before the committee today.  I apologise for missing the presentation; I was in the Dáil Chamber.  However, I have been informed of the issues involved by people working on the modern languages programme in County Kerry.  I have been lobbied extensively on the issue and have engaged with the people involved.  I raised this matter in a Topical Issue debate with the Minister before Christmas, but, unfortunately, the response was not very positive.  He was adamant that there would not be a rowing back on the decision.  In addition, the cost factor was not brought forward as the primary reason for shelving the initiative.  However, it is something on which I will continue to work.  As Deputy Aodhan Ó Ríordáin mentioned, this has ironically brought the teaching of languages in primary schools onto the political agenda, which is one positive to come from it.  However, that is of no consolation to those benefitting from the initiative or to those involved in teaching languages.It is very relevant that we are now examining the primary education sector and how we are addressing the teaching of languages, not just European languages but also languages spoken in the BRIC countries.

#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	96	We are looking to these countries as markets we can develop and expand.  I have rarely seen Portuguese being taught in an Irish school.  Portuguese, Russian, Hindi and Chinese are languages we could consider.  Are there specific proposals that could be given to the committee regarding the overall curriculum and how modern languages could be incorporated into it?  That would be very helpful.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I invite the delegates to respond to the final questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I will respond before asking Dr. Kirwan to discuss the Irish context, in particular.With regard to the decision made, it was predicated on a policy decision.  As I outlined in my submission, that policy decision was largely based on a report taken in a very narrow context.  It certainly did not reflect the broader content of the report.  We spoke at length about this in the submission.I am delighted to hear that schools in County Kerry were in contact with the Deputy.  There are over 50 schools in that county doing this as part of our programme.  In terms of building capacity, we have made concerted efforts not only through the colleges of education but also through our extensive links with the ATCI, the education centre network, to develop local language course provision.  Importantly, the cultural institutes and embassies have had a very strong role in building capacity and invested significantly in recent years in this programme in terms of ensuring teachers receive adequate support.To refer to the UK context, I will divide it into three regions.  Modern language learning is compulsory at Key Stage 3, which approximates to the senior end of primary school here.  There were plans to introduce it at Key Stage 2 as a statutory requirement, but that decision is being reviewed.  Recently, however, the Secretary of State for Education, Mr. Michael Gove, has said he wants to introduce modern languages from the age of five years in England.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	99	That would give them an advantage over us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	100	Absolutely.  In Scotland it is not a mandatory part of the curriculum, but, in practice, 98% of pupils are learning a modern language.  Wales has recently introduced a new trilingual literacy strategy called, Supporting Trilingual Literacy, in which it is prioritising English, Welsh and foreign languages in primary schools.I will hand over to Dr. Kirwan to discuss her school.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	101	First, it costs nothing in my school because the teachers on our staff teach it to our fifth and sixth classes.  In terms of teachers and anybody teaching modern languages in my school, even when they go on holidays, they do not leave their work behind because invariably they come back loaded with resources they have paid for themselves.  Perhaps taking a holiday is not such a bad idea.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	102	They come back loaded.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Absolutely, with resources for teaching languages.  Senator Feargal Quinn will be very familiar with the area in which the school I am teaching in is located.  In the last 18 years it has undergone a dramatic change.  It went from being the local village school, in which the grannies, grandads and parents went to school, to having 70% of its enrolment being non-native speakers of English.  We have acquired extensive experience in language learning and teaching in that time.  The children who are most successful in the school, who are not Irish, are those who attend Polish, Romanian or Urdu classes after school.  In terms of comparisons with the cohort not doing this, the English language development of these children would be at a higher level.As Ms Flanagan said, if one looks at literacy from a narrow viewpoint, one will get a narrow result.  That is very important in the context of the new literacy programme.  As Mr. Jim Cummins who has been mentioned and Professor David Little, formerly professor of linguistics in TCD, tell us, languages should not be taught in isolation; learning languages enhances all language learning and, therefore, literacy.
#FidelmaHealyEames	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-party	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-dob	unknown-#FidelmaHealyEames-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	104	If the programme is pulled, will Dr. Kirwan continue it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I hope we would be allowed to continue it, as it would be a shame not to.  I can offer a solution, given that solutions are being sought here also.  With regard to teacher training, we have courses offering business with French law or something else or with another modern language.  I firmly believe that is the way we should proceed with teacher training.As far as methods are concerned, an issue mentioned by Senator Feargal Quinn, the Council of Europe has done an enormous amount of work on language teaching and learning in the past ten to 12 years.  Is that work filtering down here?  It has certainly filtered down to the MLPSI.  We came across it simply because we had to, as we were dealing with non-native speakers of English.  I am not sure that those methods have filtered beyond that and if we were to bring the language component into teacher training, it would have enormous benefits to the teaching of Irish, modern languages and English.

The witnesses can continue answering questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	110	We were thrown in at the deep end because we were at the forefront of taking in people from abroad.  When the MLPSI programme started, we applied to be part of it.  Unfortunately, we were not successful the first time around.  We had taught French to children in our schools since 1988 but unfortunately a small number were able to go to class after school.  We could not do it during school.  A number of years ago, we are thrilled to get onto the MLPSI programme because all of the children in fifth class and sixth class could avail of it.  As well as that, teachers in our schools teaching French could receive training from MLPSI that they would not otherwise have got.  It has changed the way they teach languages.  We have three official languages in school and 40 unofficial languages.  The methodology promoted and developed through the Council of Europe and channelled through MLPSI has filtered into teaching.  It is a successful way to teach.  This project has remained a pilot project but it should be available and compulsory in all schools.  The methodology used and the enhancement of teachers' professional skills as a result is second to none.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	111	We have gone over time but the Minister has not yet arrived so we can continue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	112	We have commented on all aspects of our submission.  We discussed the impact it has and how it fits with literacy.  The Minister referred to the PISA results and Ireland's place at 17th.  Most of the countries ahead of Ireland on the list have committed to multilingualism for a long time.  This includes countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Finland and the Netherlands, which foster multilingualism from early on in primary schools.  That helps us to see how literacy is addressed.  When children learn a third language, they have already developed literacy skills in their first and second languages.  This gives them the chance to enhance their skills.  They stand back from the languages they know and they can reflect on language and see how it works.  That makes them better at the languages they know and better at learning languages later.We have not touched on the inter-cultural dimension of our project.  The work teachers do in classrooms on inter-cultural awareness is invaluable.  It broadens children's rights and gives them skills to deal with other cultures at the same time as examining their own culture.  They reflect on how we do things here and how things are done abroad.  It happens in the context of modern language learning in the modern language.  That aspect of it, developing the inter-cultural competence, will also be lost and I think it is valuable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The voice of parents is included in our submission but not reiterated orally.  It has been part of the constitution of the National Parents Council Primary for over 30 years that modern languages should be offered to all children.  The last major survey of parental attitudes to the education system was the Your Education System, YES, campaign from a few years ago.  Parents were asked about 13 issues and the lack of provision of modern languages in primary schools was the issue of greatest concern.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Several options have been proposed and I am aware that we did not get to go through them.  We are solution focused and we will look at the options to maintain modern languages in primary schools.  As John Harris from Trinity College Dublin pointed out, 20 years is the standard time from introduction to completion of a programme.  Members are familiar with the 20 year strategy for Gaeilge.  We are 12 years into a 20-year journey and the investment will be totally lost.  On behalf of all of us and the Kildare Education Centre, I would like the committee to recommend to the Minister that modern languages be maintained and that the process of further consultation be entered into.  There are opportunities here to reflect on other issues.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I cannot speak on behalf of committee because we must make a decision on it.  It is something we will discuss further.  Witnesses have given us much useful information.  We must discuss the issue and formulate a plan for the years ahead.  Our committee spans three Departments, each of which is affected by what the witnesses discussed.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is concerned with jobs, which is key, and it affects the Department of Social Protection because of the impact of jobs lost.  This is the committee to examine solutions and see what we can put together.  I will recommend that we should examine it in the long term as well.  That decision will be taken by the committee and we will engage with the witnesses again as well as linking with the Minister.  He was here last week and we have had meetings with him before.  It is not just a money issue, he genuinely believes the curriculum is full in primary school with regard to literacy and numeracy.  The witnesses may shake their heads but that is what he believes.  We must work on the issue and discuss it.  The witnesses presented interesting data to show that their programme helps literacy.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I want to emphasise that this is not a threat to any budget.  It is complementary to the budget.  With regard to the flavour of the month, the literacy and numeracy policy, this will work in parallel to it and will supplement it.  It is not in conflict with the literacy and numeracy policy.  I thank the Chairman, Deputies and Senators for listening to us.  We know they have listened with great interest and we think we have furthered their understanding of the initiative and its value.  We look forward to further discourse in one format to another.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I welcome the proposal and, as a member of the committee, I hope we can discuss it as soon as possible.  If there is any leeway, I hope we can avail of the opportunity.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I thank the witnesses on behalf of the committee.  They have made a strong case and we will work on it with the Minister.  The transcript from today's meeting will be sent to him and we will have a follow-up discussion before sending our recommendations.  I have no doubt that some of our colleagues will want to study this.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The purpose of this part of the meeting is to consider the following: a motion re a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on criminal sanctions for insider dealing and market manipulation.  The briefing has been circulated to members.  I welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and his officials.  The format of the meeting will be a briefing from the Minister followed by a question and answer session.  We have been here since 9.30 a.m., so members are coming and going.  I apologise for the low numbers but that might reduce the number of questions and I might get the Minister out of here time.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21507	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I thank the Chairman.  I am accompanied by John Kelly, Sabha Greene and Vincent Madigan.  As members will probably know, the background to this motion is that under the terms of the functioning of the EU Council, we must notify whether we are willing to be bound by directives in the justice area.  This is one such directive.  Ireland, like the UK, must decide whether to opt in to be bound by it.  In advance of that, I must appear before the Houses of the Oireachtas to seek approval that we opt in.The subject of the motion is the Commission's proposal for a directive which will, for the first time, set out a common set of offences across the Union and send a clear message that the EU will not tolerate abuse in its financial markets.  The draft directive will also require member states to provide at least a shared minimum level of criminal sanctions for those offences in their national laws, so there will no longer be an opportunity for so-called "forum shopping".Before I turn to the detail of the directive, I will set out the context for this proposal.  The original EU regime for market abuse dates back to 2003 and, as members well know, much has happened since then.  The Commission has identified a number of areas where that system is no longer fit for purpose, so it has published a package of proposals designed to update and enhance the regulatory regime.  There is a number of elements to that.  One is to extend the cover to a wider range of financial markets and products while another is provide greater powers of enforcement.  Those two are embraced in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and a new regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation also known as the market abuse regulation.  This third directive deals with criminal sanctions, so the three pieces together are intended to improvement enforcement across the EU.  The other two do not fall within the justice pillar and, as such, do not have the same procedure as that in respect of the criminal sanctions.The current difficulties with enforcement across the EU arise because the Commission found in its research that there are significant discrepancies between the existing regimes in the member states.  For example, some countries lack effective sanctioning powers while in others, criminal sanctions are not available for certain market abuse offences and this leaves scope for market abusers who can take advantage of the differences and avoid sanctions by choosing to establish in a member state with few sanctions while trading in another member state.  The divergences between the laws in member states can also hinder prosecutions for cross-border activities as enforcement agencies take different approaches or work to different rules and definitions of offences.Clearly, this situation cannot continue, so the proposed directive is designed to remove these differences between member states and so eliminate the opportunity for investors intending to abuse market rules to choose the most benign jurisdiction for their base.The directive has nine key articles.  The first two cover the scope and definitions to be used.  These are still open questions as the final scope and definitions will only be clear when the EU has adopted two related legal instruments, namely, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the proposed regulation insider dealing and market manipulation.  It is only when the negotiation on those draft regulations are complete that we will see precisely what trading activities and what types of financial instruments will be covered by this directive.Articles 3 and 4 define the main market abuse offences and these will be insider dealing and market manipulation.  The distinction here that brings the offence into the realm of criminal sanction is intent – in other words, the person must commit the offence intentionally if it is to be considered criminal - otherwise it can pursued as an offence attracting administrative sanctions.Article 5 provides that inciting, aiding and abetting either insider dealing or market manipulation will also be criminal offences while attempt of some of the insider dealing and market manipulation offences will, in themselves, be offences too – in other words, to attempt to promote that sort of insider dealing.Article 6 requires member states to introduce criminal sanctions for each of the offences above that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive as this is the first time the Commission has proposed an approximation of criminal laws in any area of law and as there is such a divergence between member states currently, it has stopped short of stipulating the penalties here.  However, article 9 of the draft directive provides that within four years of the directive coming into force, the Commission will review the operation of the sanctions and consider the need to introduce common minimum rules on the types and level of sanctions at that stage.  Articles 7 and 8 deal with the liability of corporations and ensure they can also be prosecuted in certain circumstances.As for the next steps, if the Houses give their approval to these motions, Ireland will participate in the application of this directive once it is adopted.  Of course, approval to participate does not mean we will accept all elements of the proposal.  While we already have a regime of criminal sanctions here which, to a large extent, is similar to what is being proposed, there are likely to be some features which will need further work from an Irish perspective.  For example, the Commission's proposal will extend the coverage to a wider range of markets and products, although, as I mentioned, the full scope is still not certain.  To what extent that means we will need to adapt our rules and procedures is not yet clear.  These are issues we need to tease out in determining the Irish negotiating position.  That will be done over the coming months together with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Clearly, the views of the Central Bank as the competent authority in this area will be important also.In the meantime, the Government believes it is essential for Ireland to be in at the beginning of this negotiation to work with our EU partners in the design of a modern and effective framework for combating the most serious financial crimes.  There is nothing new in saying that financial services have become more and more international in their operations and we, as legislators, need to adapt the laws to meet the challenge.  This proposal for a directive has the potential to be an important tool in facing that challenge.  I commend the proposed directive to members and recommend that Ireland participation in the adoption and application of it.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The legislation being considered is very worthwhile and it is interesting that it is coming from Europe.  One of the areas which needs to be covered is this speculation on food marketing prices and markets that contribute to the food spikes.  We have see revolutions happen around the world, such as in Egypt, due to this sort of thing but, in many ways, it also has an effect on us when we go to do our shopping.Last week, Barclays Bank won a shame award for speculating on food prices.    The award was presented at Davos by the World Development Movement, a group which stated that this type of speculation should be made illegal.  It was explained very well that what makes it illegal is the intent.  In my opinion when people invest, something like that might happen, however, if their intent is to speculate, to cause that outcome, it would have an effect.The proposed law aims to discover fraudulent activity.  I draw members' attention to information technology companies that are able to produce e-discovery.  I had not known about e-discovery - the practice of examining electronic records to unearth important data and relationships.  There is one notable case in the US that I have as an example, which was reported in The Economist in July 2011, and thanks to similar software, a link was found between several executives at a firm who had been issuing bogus invoices in order to inflate its revenue.  If we are to do something similar, there should be a way of being able to use information, in the way that the freedom of information operates.  I was impressed by the way the Swedish freedom of information works, where everything is automatically put online.  One does not have to apply to get the information.  It is available for the public.  I do not know whether we should consider that system.  I was never enthusiastic about FOI, when the legislation was introduced more than ten years ago.  Now, there is a great deal of sense in putting the information we have about what is happening online which would make it much more open to the public.  The information would be automatically available, without a person having to request it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21507	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	122	It is important to be clear that speculation in itself is not being outlawed, it is the more precise offences of insider dealing, when people in possession of inside information use that information to acquire or dispose of financial instruments.  People can speculate on the value, which would not be illegal, but manipulating information to give themselves an advantage or giving false or misleading signals as to the supply or demand is an offence.  The case that Senator Quinn cited of bogus invoices would look to fall into the category of market manipulation.  To buy in the hope that the price would rise, would not fall into that category.  Clearly whatever form of detection, be it e-enabled or otherwise, would form part of the evidence.On the issue of freedom of information, my understanding is that FOI covers information in public rather than in private sector bodies and the obligation to disclose commercial transactions would raise legal issues that go considerably beyond what we are discussing here.  I know it has been raised in the context of fair trading rules in the grocery area, which the Senator knows more about than I do.  The other issue, is that the Government is looking at whistleblower legislation, in the context of having broad based whistleblower legislation that would protect people who disclose information around practices such as these.  There is an anticipation of changes.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I call Deputy Crowe.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I would not pretend to know a great deal about this area.  The Minister stated in his submission that there are discrepancies across different states, that some states have weaker legislation.  What states have weaker legislation?  How effective is the current Irish legislation in this area?  Is it robust enough?The Minister mentioned the proposed whistleblower legislation, which is welcome, and it would be helpful if it were in tandem with the proposal that we are discussing today.  How significant is it that this proposal suggests criminal sanctions in the European Union?  Will it give rise to concerns?  I know this proposed directive arises from the Lisbon treaty, but does that mean that directives arising from the treaty will be a regular occurrence?  I do not think anyone has major problems with this specific directive on insider trading.  I am not aware, and it has not yet hit my radar, that Johnny is up before the court on such offences under our legislation.  We have seen instances where people were trying to manipulate the value of bank shares.  That is a matter for another forum.  I have no doubt but that the motion before us will be passed as the Government has a majority, but I think it raises a number of issues, which I ask the Minister to consider and respond to them this morning.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21507	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I am not sure we have the details of the different regimes in other states.  I have information on the research done by the Commission but I do not have a name and shame list from it.  I know our regime is regarded as one of the more robust.  Our sanction regime was established in 2005 and has criminal sanctions up to ten years in prison, a fine up to €10 million and the right of civil action.  The biggest case, members would have seen, is DCC v. Fyffes, which ended up with substantial damages being awarded and administrative sanctions under financial regulation.  I think our legislation would be deemed as among the effective criminal regimes.  It has clear criminal sanctions.  Following a review of the directive, four years after it has been adopted, there may be a question as to whether our sanctions are correct or if there is a need for a minimum sanction.  I understand we have the right to opt-in in each case.  If we do not like the idea that the EU would produce a directive in some area of criminal activity, we have the right to opt out.  In this instance we are saying that in the case of market manipulation and insider dealing, we regard it as good for Ireland to be part of an EU wide regime, because such crimes have the potential to have global effect and that there should be a similar regime across the European Union, so that people cannot evade their responsibilities.  Let me assure members that this would be coming through the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and it is unusual that this issue is before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  The principle of subsidiarity would be applied by the EU and it would only be adopting directives with European wide sanctions, where there was a belief that the crime required member wide sanctions.  I think there is good protection against creep, undermining the right of Parliament to decide its own affairs.I do not have a country by country breakdown.

Does our legislation in this area work in tandem with that in the United Kingdom?  Uniformity is needed across the European Union.  Will the provisions of the proposal also apply to the financial markets?  I am sure legislation on the financial sector differs across the globe, including within the European Union.  In recent years, questions have been asked about the lax approach the authorities here have taken towards the banking sector which engaged in widespread reckless behaviour.  In the United States bankers faced the law and suffered the consequences whereas no action has yet been taken in this country.  How will the proposal impact on financial services?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21507	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The United Kingdom will also be able to opt out.  I understand it is the intention of the UK to proceed but we do not yet know because the British Government must seek parliamentary approval for its position in the same way as we are seeking it.  However, the UK has indicated it is generally supportive of the proposal and we expect Britain to adopt it.The proposed directive covers financial markets.  As I indicated, the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID, is extending the range of financial instruments which will be embraced by EU directives.  As such, its scope is being broadened.  In the case of Ireland, this will mean that areas such as alternative securities markets will come within the scope of the proposed directive.  At present, these markets are overseen by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  They would be brought into the remit of the European Union and the Financial Regulator.On actions in respect of any particular offences that have occurred, I cannot comment on this matter other than to note that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has assembled the cases and the investigation is well advanced.  It will be for the Director of Public Prosecutions to act on the files that are submitted.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21507	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-02-01 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I thank members for their support.  Anyone who considers the anguish and disruption the financial crisis has caused for many ordinary people will realise the importance of tightening rules and regulations.  While it may be dusty, difficult and complex to do this type of work, it is important to try to protect people for the longer term.
