#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.Under the direction of the programme manager, the primary function of the special advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government.They are also tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, administrative and media matters and performing such other functions as may be directed by me, from time to time.Each of the advisers liaises with several Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers.  My advisers attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities.  They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government.The advisers assigned to the Government Chief Whip and to the Minister of State provide advice to the Ministers of State and monitor, facilitate and secure the achievements of Government objectives that relate to the Department of the Taoiseach, as requested by the Ministers of State.My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis.  He monitors and reports to me on progress in implementing the programme for Government.The following new staff have been appointed to my Department since the general election: Eoghan O'Neachtain to fill the vacancy for Government Press Secretary; John Downing as deputy Government Press Secretary; and Jill Collins to fill the vacancy for special adviser to the Chief Whip.While the Green Party programme manager based in Government Buildings is not a member of staff of my Department, my Department has engaged a personal assistant to provide administrative assistance to him and to the deputy Government Press Secretary.There has been no increase in the number of special advisers who assist me in dealing with the complexities and volume of Government business — in fact, there has been a decrease of two.

I am sure he would prefer to answer questions like these than other questions.What is the total cost to the State of the political advisers appointed by Government?  As a fair-minded man has he looked at the disproportion of resources available to Opposition parties to deal with the business of democracy?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I do not have an overall figure for the Government.  The cost of my own staff is approximately €600,000.  The overall cost is far less than under previous Governments when there were well over 50 or 60 advisers.  While it is not a direct parallel, when former Deputy McCreevy was Minister for Finance, substantial increases were made in the resources given to parties.

Depending on the people involved, it can streamline business for Minsters and the Government.  Does the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission have an input into considering whether parties might need extra resources?  We might also discuss the structure of committees and the range they must cover if the House is to do its  business effectively.  Opposition parties can find themselves in need of assistance if they are to work effectively in the interest of the people.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I am not opposed to that suggestion.  We set up and resourced the Oireachtas commission a few years ago.  The sum total of funds allocated was way over what it used to be in previous times.  Every Member now has a second member of staff.  The Government Whip supports the continuing expansion of research facilities which help Members to contribute to debates by facilitating them in researching matters.  Most of the issues raised by the Deputy come within the scope of the Oireachtas commission.  If he has particular issues, I will be glad to take them up with the Chief Whip.

My advisers attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities".  Today he indicated some of those within his Department who have roles in this regard.  Which of his advisers liaises with the Department of Health and Children?  Does that same party liaise with the chief executive of the Health Service Executive, Professor Brendan Drumm?  How often does the Taoiseach receive briefings from his adviser on health matters?  Are those briefings follow-ons to engagements with the Minister for Health and Children, her Department and the chief executive of the HSE?  Is the liaison between the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of Health and Children, or the respective offices of the Taoiseach and the Minister, everything it should be?  Is the Taoiseach fully conversant with the detail of the shambles of our health system in the pursuit of the delivery of health care by his Minister, her Department and the HSE?  In the light of that, will the Taoiseach revisit the matter of co-ordination?  What role will the Taoiseach's advisers play in helping to ensure he has a clear and full understanding of what is being done in his name, as premier Minister and that of Government, in collective responsibility with the Minister for Health and Children, in respect of health care provision in this State?Do political advisers or, perhaps, the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, assist or advise the Taoiseach in the preparation of scripts and various articles submitted by him for publication in what I can only describe as his now regular appearance in the Sunday Independent?

There are weekly or even more frequent meetings at official level on health reform, ongoing negotiations and so on, depending on what issues arise.  There is weekly contact between senior officials from my Department, not necessarily advisers, and officials from the Department of Health and Children and the Heath Service Executive.  The officials always meet a week or two before a Cabinet committee on health.  There is close liaison not alone on health but, in respect of health matters in particular.  There is a close working relationship between the Department of Finance, the HSE, my Department and the Department of Health and Children in respect of health matters.

Do regular meetings take place between the Taoiseach's advisers and advisers from the line Departments and are those meetings minuted?  Do they take place on a particular day of the week or, before or after the regular Government meeting?  What is communicated between advisers at those meetings and how does this differ from the communication that would take place between the secretaries of Government and the Secretaries General of the various Departments?Will the Taoiseach give a sum total of the number of special advisers now employed by his Department?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Effectively, there are three advisers employed by my Department.  A fourth person acts as a co-ordinator between all Ministers of State as they do not have advisers.Yes, is the answer to the Deputy's next question; a programme manager chairs a weekly meeting, the agenda of which usually relates to the Government's programme for that week and any other outstanding issues, perhaps, from the previous week.  For issues that require more time, the key advisers, not usually the entire team but those involved in the issue, would meet a second time during the week.   Meetings in regard to the Estimates and the budget take place at least weekly, but, normally, they take place twice a week and, at other times of the year, more frequently.

Its role is to identify and assist in progressing and resolving issues related to infrastructure planning and delivery, ensuring that they are adequately prepared for consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Housing, Infrastructure and PPPs and, where necessary, by the Government.  The cross-departmental team normally meets on a monthly basis.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	23	In regard to the construction sector, to which 25% of the economy is now linked with 12% of our workforce whereas 5% is the norm in most other countries, what is the view of the cross-departmental team regarding the recommendation of the Construction Industry Federation that a cut of 50% in stamp duty is needed to re-ignite the construction sector?  Was that recommendation deemed appropriate, real, unrealistic or just irrelevant?What is the view of the cross-departmental team regarding the comments of the CIF that only 45,000 houses will be built in 2008, some 20,000 fewer than the Government has predicted?  That will have serious implications for the construction sector.  Arising from that, what discussions, if any, took place regarding the significance of the employment content particularly of migrant economic workers from eastern European countries who will be primarily affected by a downturn in the construction sector?  Was there an assessment of how many would be likely to leave the country or how many might stay?In regard to public private partnerships and regional development, the Ennis bypass is very welcome.  The Taoiseach may have been there and seen the impact of this major piece of road.  Did the cross-departmental team have any discussion with regard to the Shannon-Heathrow connection which is central to regional development?  How does the removal of the Heathrow slots from Shannon to Belfast protect and defend the strategic interest of regional development, which was specifically identified by the Government?  Given that the Government now states we must do extra to make up for the loss of the Heathrow slots from Shannon, what ideas were thrown around at the meeting of the cross-departmental team?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and public private partnership is not involved in discussions on the Shannon to Heathrow connection.  A separate group of officials has met with a large number of the interest groups for the Shannon area, both in Dublin and in Shannon.  It has engaged with State agencies in assessing the consequences of the loss of the route by analysing the figures of the past number of years.  The group has also helped to co-ordinate efforts across a number of Departments to come up with whatever initiatives the State can take to alleviate the difficulties and to find alternatives.  It is not the team to which the questions refer but it has been very active.On the Deputy's question about housing, I have heard what the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has said.  I attended a function yesterday, in its new headquarters, relating to CIF pensions and I spoke to a number of people involved so I am aware of the views of some of them on this issue.  Stamp duty is not a matter for the Civil Service but the Department of Finance.  There has been ongoing contact with the Department and the Department does not share the CIF's view at all.  The committee tries to co-ordinate efforts and takes a big interest in infrastructure.  The key objective is to achieve the appropriate level of supply to meet demand, which has been the challenge for the past number of years.  There has been unprecedented growth in the past ten years and the market continues to be underpinned, in terms of volume, by demographic trends.  The high levels of housing output in recent years has to be viewed in the context of a relatively low ratio of housing stock for the population compared to other EU countries.  The recent report by DKM Consultants, which is the most comprehensive report on construction industry indicators and was published at the end of August, indicates the likelihood of housing completions being approximately 77,000 this year, which would appear to be consistent with the views expressed by various commentators who have said the figure will be lower next year.Price escalation is the greatest threat to the market and the committee has been trying over the years to ensure we keep supply and demand in equilibrium because that is how we keep the industry strong, and employment in the industry high.  It is also how we will bring about a moderation in house prices, which is what we have been trying to do for some time.The view expressed by the committee in the various discussions is that price escalation is the greatest threat, not only in terms of affordability but also because excessive prices increase the risk of a subsequent fallback.  The Government has issued timely cautions in the past two years about the danger of the moderation in prices being reversed.  Regrettably, our concerns proved well founded as the moderating price trend reversed dramatically, from single digit growth in early 2005 to as much as 25% in the third quarter of last year.  Even though there were a number of interest rate increases in that period the value of approvals in the second quarter of last year was almost 60% higher than in the same quarter of 2004 and the availability of so much additional funding in a heated market was, in the view of the committee and its advisers, bound to exert some pressure.  Against that background, the recent turnaround from unsustainable house price escalation, such as happened in 2005 and 2006, should be neither surprising nor unwelcome.  We are now seeing transition to a more balanced and mature market and it is in everybody's interest that the housing market evolve on an orderly and sustainable growth path in terms of prices, lending and output.  This positive overall view is reflected in the Central Bank's report of last week.  Easing prices should bring more buyers into the market, helping to ensure its continued growth.We have also taken a range of measures to help affordability, such as general reductions in taxation and the doubling of mortgage interest relief in the last budget.  We have abolished stamp duty for first-time buyers and have introduced affordable housing schemes.  There was a new record in house completions last year and, even though this year is experiencing an easing in output, the level is still likely to be high.          Investment in the NDP will help to underpin construction on the wider front.  The completion figure for the first seven months of 2007 is 44,000.  If adjustment were made month by month for delayed ESB connections, on which the figures are worked out, the trend would still be high.  There is no doubt that there will be a moderation next year.  We just have to watch how it goes during the remainder of this year and into 2008.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Taoiseach did not say whether there was any discussion about the migrant workers staying or moving as a result of the decline.  The Minister for Finance commented on the necessity to cut back on public expenditure because of the rate of public spending by Government in the past 12 months, particularly prior to the election.  In view of this was there any discussion about public private partnership, PPP, infrastructure projects that may not now go ahead in the timescale originally envisaged?  If so, have those projects been identified?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a detailed assessment of the numbers of migrant workers in each area.  If there are redundancies in the building sector that will have an effect.  Other sectors will take up a significant amount of these, for example, there is an increase in the home improvements area, and in offices and shopping centres and other developments under the NDP.  FÁS and the Department have good figures for this trend.  The latest unemployment figures up to September at 4.7% do not show any great increase in unemployment in the construction sector.  It is too early to say but that will grow based on the projections made.One of the advantages of having surpluses in good years is that if things are tight in another year we can continue to honour our capital programme.  That is our intention.  PPPs account for €13.4 billion in the NDP, many of which are in the transport area in the seven year capital programme.  There is no proposal to cut back on those projects and we intend to honour the capital programme no matter what happens.  Overspending on the current expenditure side is modest in this year's account.  There will not be much difference over the year.  The difficulty will be on the income side which will be lower, but by how much is still a matter for debate.

Does the Taoiseach agree that the Comptroller and Auditor General's update of the five schools project provided for by a PPP is directly relevant to the role of the cross-departmental team on housing infrastructure and PPPs?  Does the Taoiseach recall that in his 2004 report the Comptroller and Auditor General flagged the possibility that the schools could have been more economically provided through direct State funding?Has the Taoiseach noted the Comptroller and Auditor General's latest report's clear indication of significant disquiet on the part of the respective school managements in all such cases regarding the provision by the private contractors of the necessary maintenance and management services that formed part of the overall arrangement?  Has he noted the Comptroller and Auditor General's statement that this raises questions as to the departmental verification of payments issued?  I understand this amounts to €1.4 million in respect of maintenance and management services.  Does the Taoiseach agree this is not a small sum of money?  As for the five schools in question, there is serious disputation with the public private partnership, PPP, approach in the ongoing servicing of the school properties' needs.  What does the Taoiseach propose to do in this regard?  As a first step, does he believe the cross-departmental team has a role in addressing this highly important element of the latest report from the Comptroller and Auditor General?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	28	While the cross-departmental team is dealing with the matter, I have read the report and the Department of Finance's summary of and recommendations on the report or, at least, its commentary on the report's recommendations.  I have noted the issue regarding the schools which the House has debated a number of times.  In many cases, a public private partnership can do an excellent job efficiently, well within budget and achieve good value for money.  Its greater cost in the long run is never disputed because the State can always borrow most cheaply.In respect of the schools issue, the Deputy might recall the Department of Finance's comments regarding value for money and the speed at which it could be dealt with.  The Department noted that the Comptroller and Auditor General's value for money report which examined to contract close the five schools projects mentioned by the Deputy had acknowledged that, ultimately, the full value for money represented by the project could only be determined over its 25-year life cycle.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General recommended that the costs and benefits of adopting a PPP approach should be assessed relative to the performance of a comparable group of schools procured conventionally.  Moreover, formal evaluation of the project over, for example, the first five years of the contract's operation would be desirable.The Department of Education and Science is preparing a five-year review of the evaluation of those schools bundled into the pilot PPP project.  This review will encompass an audit of the schools, a five-yearly review and adjustment of the running costs and an evaluation of the project to date.  In addition, the rolling programme for the whole school evaluation reports will include the pilot schools to assess the impact of PPP contracts on the work undertaken to ascertain whether the figure of €1.4 million mentioned by the Deputy constitutes good value.  However, this does not prove or disprove the case.  In many cases, PPPs can be completed very quickly by using the private sector to secure, build and deliver fixed price contracts with a payout over a 25 year period.  In many programmes, such contracts have come in well under time.  The Cork School of Music is a possible exception, as it experienced difficult problems when the company went into receivership and other procurement issues arose.  However, in all other projects the PPPs have come in under budget, having been dealt with efficiently by the private sector.  However, this constitutes only a very small part of the schools building programme.It is interesting to analyse the issue and make assessments, as the Department of Education and Science is doing.  The Department of Finance has also given its views in this regard.  However, one cannot condemn PPPs on the basis of the experiences to date.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I was not going back over the main debate that we had as to whether the PPP approach was value for money.  My position and that of the Taoiseach are well noted in that regard.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General's report be referred to the cross-departmental team?  Can he provide clarification?  The cross-departmental team has responsibility for PPP.  Will it have the opportunity of scrutiny and discussion of the Comptroller and Auditor General's most recent update report on the ongoing service provision arrangements at these five schools for which there is serious concern?  There also is concern about the verification procedures within the Department on the provision of these services, the current fee for which, in case there was any doubt, is running at €1.4 million.  This is not small change.  If the services are not being delivered, there is a serious problem on an ongoing basis, apart altogether from the substantive argument regarding PPP.  The Taoiseach should revisit the entire area, but will he clarify the two matters I have raised?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	30	It is being dealt with, not by the cross-departmental team but by the Departments of Finance and Education and Science which have comprehensively answered the various recommendations that have been put in the 2007 interim report.  The Departments have given their views.  Obviously, that report is circulated to cross-departmental teams but it was dealt with by the Department of Education and Science which was doing the follow-on and the Department of Finance which did the total assessment of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	31	There are two questions I wish to pursue with the Taoiseach.  He stated this cross-departmental team held its last meeting this morning.  On how many occasions has the cross-departmental team met since this question was last asked in the House on 27 February last?Second, can I briefly pursue with the Taoiseach his response in respect of the residential construction sector?  As I understood it, he stated he would adopt a wait and see attitude to residential construction output and its implications.  He stated that he expected output of approximately 77,000 units this year, which would be reasonably good.  If, however, as is predicted, the output for 2008 will be down to approximately 45,000, then residential construction output in 2008 will be approximately half that in 2006.  That will obviously have major implications for the levels of employment in residential construction, builders' suppliers, revenues etc.  In that context, I am a little surprised to hear the Taoiseach state there is a wait and see attitude and I ask what consideration has the cross-departmental team, the Government generally or the Taoiseach given to the consequences of a downturn in residential construction activity from 90,000 units last year to 45,000 next year, if that is what transpires.  What are the implications for employment in residential construction and for tax revenues for the State in terms of income tax, VAT on building materials and stamp duties on transactions, what are the implications in terms of the social welfare budget if there is a significant reduction in the number of people employed in construction activity, and what generally are the consequences for the economy because it has been very heavily dependent on construction activity?  As the projections are that output will fall from 90,000 units last year to 45,000 units next year and I am a little surprised to hear a wait and see attitude being adopted, I would like to know what anticipation is being given to a move of that kind and what are the implications.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	32	As I stated, it looks as if the figure for this year will be approximately 77,000 units, which would be very high.  The Department's assessment is that the figure for next year will be in the order of 55,000 units plus.  Activity in other areas of construction — house refurbishment, retail and office developments — is high and will take up much of it.  That tends to be the view.It is not a question of wait and see.  A moderation in price is a good thing.  I have answered questions on this matter for the past few years.  A little over a year ago, in the third quarter of 2006, as we moved from 25,000 houses upwards we still saw a price increase of 28%.  The fact that there is a moderation in prices is good for the market.  If this means a reduction in the overall number of houses built, so be it.  We were never going to stay up at the level of 85,000 or 90,000 units.  I would far prefer to see supply and demand coming into equilibrium with a slower rate of house inflation.  That is what we have been trying to achieve for the past seven or eight years.If we moved from 77,000 units this year with no take up in the other sectors, it has been estimated that 30,000 people could be unemployed, but a substantial number of those would be absorbed into other sectors.  We are likely to see an increase in the level of unemployment in the private house construction sector.  We will hold discussions with the Construction Industry Federation and others.  I was in contact with the CIF last night and we do not foresee a position where the major contractors hold back and play a wait and see game.  They are the ones who have planning permission and can proceed with contracts.  They are waiting to see what will happen in the market.Many contractors would say the banks have tightened up on the pre-sale arrangements under which they lend to them.  Up to last year the banks allowed contractors to build up to 40 or 50 houses without them being sold but now they operate on a system of lending for five or ten houses.  I do not have that information but that is what the construction sector has said.  That would force the building sector to slow down.From all the analysis of the next few years based on population, age structure, reduced household size, immigration and housing stock being below the EU level, it still appears there should not be a reason for the figures to reduce excessively.  That is the professional analysis of people within and outside the Government.  I cited the DKM report recently.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I share the Taoiseach's wish that there will be a soft landing, as has been referred to, and that we will not see grief.  There have been indications for some time that we are moving towards a significant reduction in house construction activity.  The Taoiseach referred to the lending practices of the banks, which have been in place for building land for some time.  Indications have also come from the drop in the number of planning applications.I appreciate that on the refurbishment side, planning applications are not required.  Are there indications or is information available on whether there is an increase in planning applications for office buildings, shopping centres and the type of construction activity the Taoiseach hopes will pick up at least some of the slack if there is a downturn in construction activity on the residential side?  To my knowledge there has not been a significant increase in planning applications on that side of the equation.My basic question is whether the Government has a contingency plan.  The construction industry has been a major part of the economy, with one in eight people working in it.  If there is to be a downturn, albeit with a soft landing, what is the game plan, or is there one?  I would have thought this was the type of subject on which the cross-departmental team would have been coming up with answers.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The employment level has not dropped this year because there was very strong demand in the categories other than the non-residential sector — I believe there are five categories in total.  That is why the figures have held up so well this year, even though the level of construction reduced from 93,000 units to 77,000, and if one considers the second half of the year, it is even lower than 77,000 given the carryover.The game plan from the Government's point of view involves the enormous injection of expenditure into the capital programme across the headings.  This involves several areas.  The schools summer works programme which was directly designed for small and medium sized buildings and, in some cases, bigger buildings accounts for almost €300 million.  There is also a huge capital programme for first, second and third level education, the roads programme and the infrastructure programme.  That investment continues.  The challenge for us up to 2013 is to be able to continue to invest that level of resources and to do so without construction inflation such as we experienced in the early years of the last plan in order that we achieve far better value for money.  While we cannot control the residential and private sector market, there is the social and affordable housing programme which involves 6,600 units.  In all of the other areas of the NDP we are investing huge resources in the construction sector.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I welcome Deputies Brian Hayes and Quinn as spokespersons for their respective parties and thank them for facilitating the change to today's business.In recent years unprecedented levels of investment have been provided both to improve existing school facilities and provide extra school places where needed.  Improved forward planning has also been put in place through greater co-operation between the Department of Education and Science and local authorities and the publication of ten-year area development plans by the Department.  This combination of investment and planning has allowed extensions to be built to schools all over Ireland, while many new schools have also been built in order to meet the needs of developing areas.  Construction work this year alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils, mainly in developing areas.With regard to the specific issue of school places in Balbriggan, as raised by Deputy Hayes, the situation is as follows.  Conscious of the fact that Balbriggan is a developing area, the Department has facilitated a significant expansion in the number of school places in the area in recent years.  Established schools have been given extra teachers and accommodation, while new schools also opened in 2005 and 2006.  Educate Together had also indicated its intention to open a new school in Balbriggan in 2008.  At the same time the Department has been working with Fingal County Council to acquire land for new school buildings.Given the population expansion that has been taking place in Balbriggan, departmental officials kept the enrolments situation under review over the summer in consultation with the existing schools.  As soon as it became clear applications for the schools had grown to such an extent that a new school would be needed this year, my Department acted swiftly to secure accommodation for up to 120 children in a new school in Sunshine House.  Educate Together agreed to be the patron of the school.  I express my thanks to it for working with us to open the school within such a tight timeframe.  I also convey my thanks to the principal of the school, whom I know had a difficult first few weeks with all the media focus on the school.  I know she is deeply committed to ensuring her pupils receive a top quality education.It was never and is not the Department's intention to establish schools solely for children of a particular ethnic background.  However, in a situation where these children needed places, the new school was the only option.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The current ethnic make-up of Bracken Educate Together national school is reflective of the nature of the families that had moved to the area recently.  It is not the result of any unwillingness on the part of the existing schools to accept children of any particular ethnicity or religion.  In fact, some of the existing schools have quite large numbers of newcomer children enrolled.  I know many people in Balbriggan were very upset by the implications in some sectors of the media that there was any form of racism at play in this regard.The Department intends to work with all schools in the area to help achieve a better spread of children of all nationalities across the different schools in future years.  Common enrolment policies may be one way of achieving this.  I accept that providing sufficient pupil places in all rapidly developing areas, including those with large immigrant communities, is absolutely vital to ensuring enrolment policies do not lead to immigrants being unable to secure places.  Under the national development plan, €4.5 billion is being invested to improve existing school buildings and provide extra accommodation for an expected growth of 100,000 in the school-going population in the coming years.  Together with the improvements in planning already put in place and those provided for in the new programme for Government, this will enable my Department to meet the needs of developing areas into the future.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I thank the Minister for her good wishes to me as the new Fine Gael spokesperson on education.Is the Minister seriously suggesting to the House that she takes no responsibility for what has become, in effect, a segregated model of education in north County Dublin due to the failure of her Department over a long period to put in place additional educational facilities?  Does she agree that her Department is not fit for purpose in terms of the provision of additional educational facilities in growing new suburbs?  Will she confirm that in 1999, when one of the schools concerned, St. Mologa's national school Balbriggan, applied for a major extension of its facilities the Department lost the application and then refused to approve it, despite the fact that children from a variety of ethnic backgrounds were available to fill the places the works would have delivered?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Up to 15,000 more children are attending school than was the case at this time last year.  A great deal of work was done to accommodate each of these additional children and only 50 children were left without a place.  While phenomenal progress was made in ensuring places were made available, it can be difficult to achieve complete accuracy in this regard owing to the movement of people into and within the country.  It was a major achievement to have been within 50 places of the required number.The provision of places for junior infants in schools in Balbriggan has doubled since 2002.  While it is not desirable that a school would only have children from an ethnic background, the position is reflective of the area and the new communities which have been established in Balbriggan.  A similar situation arose in areas to which Irish people emigrated because people gravitate to areas where members of their own communities live.  Anyone living in Balbriggan would agree that, based on the people moving into the town's estates, the school in question, which is more mixed than we initially thought, is a reflection of the new town.  The provision of school places and ensuring integration continue to be the Department's priorities.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Arising from events in Balbriggan in September, I ask the Minister to consider establishing a national forum on education to address the patronage, management and ownership of schools.  Given that more than 90% of all schools are owned or controlled by the Catholic Church, does the Minister agree it would be more sensible to establish such a forum to allow the education partners to engage in a public discussion of all the relevant issues?  I understand the Minister is involved in bilateral discussions with the education partners concerning a new model she wants to establish.  Will she consider establishing a national forum along the lines I suggest as a means of having a public debate of the crucial question of ownership and control of our schools?I welcome the statement made by the Catholic bishops today regarding the church's ambition to divest itself of some schools in areas in which it controls a large number of schools.  Nevertheless, we need a much more thorough and public discussion of the issues, as opposed to a secretive, bilateral discussion between the Department, on the one hand, and the various education partners, on the other.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	39	There is nothing secretive about the manner in which the Department works.  I will give two practical examples.  First, the production of our area development plans is a public process in which consultation with every interested partner and members of the public is invited.  A number of such plans, which determine what schools are needed and where they are needed, have been published.  This is a public consultation process which takes place at local level and encourages real and active citizenship.  Second, all the new schools being approved are the subject of a public consultation process.  They are properly advertised in local areas and there is public involvement.  As Deputy Hayes stated, not only are we engaged in bilateral work with school patrons in which we continuously monitor changing circumstances, we also work closely with local authorities, which have public debates by virtue of being full of public representatives.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	40	As the Deputy will be aware, my Department has been prioritising developing areas for investment under the school building and modernisation programme.  During the period of the previous National Development Plan 2000-2006, record levels of investment and the streamlining of delivery systems allowed a major acceleration of the schools building programme.  More than €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first and second level.  This was the largest investment programme in the history of the State and delivered more than 7,800 building projects involving tens of thousands of extra permanent school places.Innovations in the delivery of school buildings, such as generic repeat designs and the use of the design and build model, have been introduced to ensure new school buildings are delivered in the fastest time possible.  Greater authority has been devolved to local school management boards to manage and deliver smaller building projects, thereby freeing my Department to concentrate on the large-scale projects.  We have improved forward planning through greater co-operation with local authorities and the publication of ten-year area development plans.  All of these developments have facilitated the provision of extra school places in extensions and new schools in developing areas all over the country.This is the first year of the roll-out of the NDP, which will involve an investment of more than €4.5 billion in school buildings, enabling us to take a pro-active approach to the provision of modern school accommodation, particularly in developing areas.  We are planning for an expected 100,000 additional school places in the plan's lifetime.  This year, approximately €540 million will be spent on school building infrastructure, with more than 1,500 projects on the school building programme.  Construction this year will deliver 700 classrooms.The commitment to a developing areas unit in the programme for Government reflects a desire to build on the improvements made in school planning in recent years and to ensure an even sharper focus on developing areas.  The unit will liaise with local authorities, identify where new schools are needed and ensure their delivery as quickly as possible.  Although we are only a few months into the lifetime of the current Government, the administrative and technical staffing requirements for the unit, including issues of grading and reporting structures, are under consideration with a view to advancing the commitment's implementation.

The programme for Government makes a specific commitment, but the Minister has been in office in the current Government for more than three months.

The Department of Education and Science has a strong development and planning unit and close links with the local councils, which are obliged to notify and consult with the Department on zonings and developments.  During the coming weeks, we will be tightening up on the individuals involved in the issue.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I can, but I did not want to mislead the House.  I apologise for the replication in my notes.The question refers to ensuring that all children have access to primary school places in September.  I have outlined the issues concerning school planning, area development plans, the NDP, the provision of money and ensuring diversity in education.The procedure to establish new schools involves notification by prospective patrons to the schools commission.  Deputy Naughten will be interested to note that in recent years the majority of new schools established have been multidenominational.  Some two thirds of schools established have been Educate Together or multidenominational.  In the current school year — the question refers to 2008 — there are 38 notified applications to establish new schools.  Of these, 21 are for multidenominational, English-medium schools, one is an interdenominational Catholic-Protestant gaelscoil and one is an interdenominational Church of Ireland-Anglican English-medium school.  These applications demonstrate a move not only to provide places but to ensure that the needs of non-Catholic students are accommodated.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Is it not the case that the public perception is that the Catholic Church is causing the problem by denying access and that the Department is facilitating the emergence of such a perception?  Is it not the case that the policy of Catholic-run schools nationally is to give priority to children within catchment areas established on a parish basis?  Is it not the case, therefore, that the real issue is capacity?  There has been a severe lack of planning by the Department to provide places on an annual basis.  It is not just a Dublin issue, but a national one.

What specific steps are being taken within the Department to reform its archaic systems which belong to a different century and continue to delay the planning and delivery of projects?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	66	It is not fair to accuse the Catholic Church of excluding children.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Deputy Naughten is not making the point the Minister says he is.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I understood that is what the Deputy said because in fairness to schools I have visited all over the country, one sees in them children of various ethnic and religious backgrounds.  They are all being welcomed into the schools.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	70	That has been going on for years.  It is not just now.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I know.  Then there is no dispute about that.  What has been emerging in recent years is demand for greater diversity.  The priority must continue to be the provision of places with the provision of diversity as the second priority.  Increasingly, newer schools, which are largely being provided in developing areas, are multidenominational.  To accommodate the needs of the new Ireland and new communities, we have decided, with Government agreement, to put forward a new patronage model that will be implemented in September 2008.  The new model will involve multi-faith schools in which all religions will be taught as well as welcomed and facilitated.We will open one school under the new model, after which we will be able to consider ways to expand this type of provision.  The new model will not represent a substitute or replacement for existing schools, but it will accommodate the new Ireland.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	72	When will we see the new model we have been promised for 12 months?  When will we see specific and detailed proposals in respect of it?  We have heard Government promises on reports and action year on year.  We need that action now.  The Minister made the point that her first priority is places and her second diversity.  She stated earlier that provision in Balbriggan, which in reality is segregated, reflects the new Balbriggan.  It is not acceptable.  The lack of places and planning has led to the lack of diversity in our schools today.  What action will be taken to make provision in 2008 rather than promises on implementation further along the road?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The issue of diversity is being addressed.  For example, among the schools that have indicated an intention to open next year, applications have been made for five new Islamic schools.  That is certainly more diverse than the current situation.  The new patronage model was not announced 12 months ago; it was announced in February of this year.  At the time, I announced the school would open under the new patronage model and that remains the plan.  We are holding detailed discussions with County Dublin VEC, which is facilitating the matter.  Given that it is new, issues naturally arise pertaining to employment and redeployment and we want to ensure the school is run in the same way as all other national schools.  However, it will open in September 2008.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Funding to schools to cover their day-to-day running costs has increased substantially in recent years.  Indeed, this year schools benefited from the largest ever increase in capitation grant.  With increases in capitation and ancillary services funding, primary schools are now getting €95 more per pupil per year than they were in 2002.  The capitation grant has been increased to €163.58 per child and the ancillary services grant has risen to €145.50 per child, bringing the total value of both grants to nearly €310 per pupil.  This amounts to €93,000 per year for a 300-pupil school.At second level, the capitation grant has increased by €50 per student since 2002, from €266 to €316.  The school support services grant which we introduced in 2000 has been increased significantly to €189 per student for voluntary secondary schools with effect from January 2007.  Voluntary secondary schools are now getting €505 per student in capitation and support services grants.  This amounts to €293,000 per year for a 500-student voluntary school.Schools have therefore benefited from major increases in funding in recent years.  A small number of schools have, however, sought assistance from my Department as an exceptional matter to deal with serious financial difficulties.  Between 2002 and 2006, my Department provided additional financial assistance for this purpose for a total of 97 schools, mainly serving disadvantaged areas.  In 2002, 26 schools received approximately €341,000; in 2003, 25 schools were allocated a total of €519,000; in 2004, €108,000 was given to ten schools; in 2005, 32 schools shared a total of €784,000; and last year, just over €112,000 was paid to four schools.It should be noted that the responsibility for sound financial management of schools' affairs rests with school authorities.  These were exceptional payments, the majority of which involved schools serving disadvantaged areas.  The Deputy will be aware that as well as general increases in capitation funding, extra financial supports are being provided for schools under the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion.  In the last school year, DEIS related grants totalling more than €17 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.This represented a substantial increase on the 2005-06 level of almost €12 million.The Government will continue to prioritise the needs of schools serving disadvantaged communities.  The emphasis on tackling educational disadvantage in recent years is absolutely unprecedented.  In 2007, we are investing nearly €730 million in measures aimed at tackling disadvantage at all levels.  This represents an increase of nearly €95 million on the 2006 figure and an almost 60% increase on the €460 million provided in 2003.As well as continuing to prioritise disadvantaged schools, we are also determined to ensure that both primary and post-primary schools benefit from increased funding over the next five years.  The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to double the standard capitation grant for primary schools.  Grants to schools for the employment of secretaries and caretakers will also be increased significantly.In summary, therefore, we have substantially increased funding for schools and will prioritise further improvements in the years ahead.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Is the admission by the Minister that a considerable number of schools have had to go to her Department, cap in hand, to be bailed out because of ongoing debt problems not evidence that the capitation regime is insufficient, particularly with regard to primary schools?  Is she aware of a survey carried out by the Irish National Teachers Organisation which shows that as many as one third of schools have to regularly organise fundraising through parents?  Does she consider it acceptable that a school has to seek voluntary subscriptions from parents for the privilege of heat and light?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	81	As I noted, the capitation grant has increased substantially over several years.  It is our hope under the programme for Government to double the rate for primary schools and substantially increase ancillary services and supports grants in recognition of the increased costs faced by schools and the way in which capitation funds are used.  Of the individual schools which received support, one had a shortfall in the funding it received for heating and roof expenses.  Last year, the same school received €28,000 through the summer works scheme and it received more than €1 million this year as part of other building programmes.  It can occasionally happen that an individual school experiences a shortfall.  In recognition of the fact that disadvantaged schools cannot come up with the same funds as other schools, we have changed the system regarding the amount of local money a school is required to possess for building projects.  Schools are allowed to request voluntary contributions, but it has come to my attention that parents have been put under pressure to make such payments.  This is wrong because schools are not allowed to put such pressure on parents.  The word "voluntary" means that parents should only make such a payment if they feel they are in a position to do so.  This matter has come to my attention and I have raised it with school principals.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	82	This is occurring all over the country and parents are being put under pressure because the State is not doing its job in terms of giving the capitation required.Regarding band one of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme, which relates to schools in the most disadvantaged areas, will the Minister consider giving additional support to such schools?  I recently visited four national schools in disadvantaged areas of my constituency that for the past three years have had an annualised debt problem.  These schools have serious problems relating to security and providing resources.  I request that the Minister examine again the issues facing the most disadvantaged schools in the country.Will the Minister comment on a commitment given in the programme for Government to double capitation over the next five years?  Why should it take five years?  Can the Minister not get on with it in the next two years?  This funding should be front-loaded as it is required to meet the escalating costs of running schools.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	83	It is our intention to double capitation over the lifetime of this Government and I accept that this action is needed.  The amount that can be achieved in any year depends upon the Estimates and budget.Regarding the DEIS scheme, priority funding goes to band one schools.  Of the amount of money I previously mentioned, an additional €13.4 million goes to 670 primary schools and 203 post-primary schools while the other €4 million is spent in a more dispersed way.  The DEIS scheme has been running for two years and the money is targeted at schools in the most disadvantaged areas so hopefully those schools that have experienced problems previously will now find they have sufficient funding.We have always recognised, especially through summer works schemes, that some schools in disadvantaged areas need fencing and security cameras and we have tried to facilitate them.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Government is determined to ensure that all students have the opportunity to acquire good information technology, IT, skills that will stand to them throughout their lives.  Equally, we are committed to realising the potential of information and communication technology, ICT, to improve the educational experience across the broad range of subjects taught in our schools.The investment of €185 million in the schools' ICT programme from 1998 to 2006 has delivered significant improvements.  The number of computers in our schools has increased significantly.  By 2005, there was one computer for every nine primary school pupils, down from one for every 16 in 2000.  At post-primary level, there was one computer for every seven pupils in 2005, down from one for every 11 in 2000.  The National Council for Technology in Education has provided over 130,000 training places for teachers in a wide range of areas, including technical courses, subject specific courses, web use, web design and digital media courses.  Through Scoilnet and other initiatives curriculum-mapped on-line resources have been made available and schools have been networked and given broadband access.Considerable improvements have been made but we are conscious that challenges remain and have set out an investment of €252 million in schools ICT under the national development plan.  A new strategy is being developed that will be comprehensive, well considered and informed by best practice in other countries.  This will ensure that schools have the right package of hardware, software, training, curricular content, maintenance services and other necessary supports available to them.The Deputy's question refers to the provision of laptops to all students, but I will take it that he means only second level students.  This would be an extremely expensive development and one that, for a number of reasons, I do not believe would be a wise investment.  To start with costs, ultimately the price of each laptop would depend on the extent to which it is possible to standardise requirements and agree volume based prices with vendors.  The machines would need to have a good suite of software included, a good memory capacity and be small enough to be relatively portable given that children would have to carry them around.  Assuming one could get all this for €500 per unit, which may well be ambitious, the total purchase cost alone of providing laptops for all 334,000 second level students would amount to about €167 million.There would of course be other very substantial costs for items such as insurance, maintenance and networking.  The issue of replacement costs would also arise as would the risk of viruses being brought into the school from home systems.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.It should also be noted that an OECD survey conducted in 2003 found that 87% of Irish young people had access to computers at home anyway.  I absolutely accept that our schools need a major investment in computer hardware but I believe that rushing out and buying 334,000 laptops would be misguided.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Given the chronic level of funding for technology in our schools, the fact that most schools must depend on Tesco vouchers to obtain additional PCs and that in Northern Ireland an interactive whiteboard is standard, which is not the case in this jurisdiction, will the Minister recognise that the proposal I have set out is sensible not only from a cost, but an environmental perspective and also in terms of encouraging greater interconnectivity within our secondary school system?Is the Minister aware of a recent project introduced under the connect programme in south Dublin in my area, in respect of which a school has been given laptop facilities, which is showing a phenomenal success rate in terms of fostering interest in school and efficiency in terms of the way time is used between pupils and teachers?  Will she give this proposal a more considered view as I believe the costs it would involve as she outlined in her reply are exaggerated?  If we were to move towards the introduction of such a project over a period, it would be cost efficient as opposed to the amounts of money she mentioned in her reply.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I genuinely do not believe that the provision of a laptop for every student is the best use of resources or the way to promote an e-learning culture in a school.  It is as important to ensure there is proper teacher training, proper technical support and good software and hardware that is relevant to the whole school.I am not convinced of the value of the provision of an interactive whiteboard for every class.  I have seen them in action in some places.  A good teacher is a good teacher with a blackboard or a whiteboard and a bad teacher is a bad teacher with a whiteboard or a blackboard.  All of this must be part of an overall strategy.  The strategy group, which is due to report to me, has been examining not only the aid of the computer in the classroom, but other aids such as digital projectors and how they can be incorporated into the curriculum.  A broader e-learning culture is important and cannot be achieved by giving each student a laptop.I am familiar with the case of the school to which the Deputy referred because I launched that project in Tallaght.  It is an exciting one but also a demanding one because, equally, the staff must be trained.  I know those involved find it a positive experience and much work has been invested in the project by the council and the staff of the school to make sure it works.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	87	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government is committed to ensuring that young people from disadvantaged communities can access third level education.  In addition to extra investment in supports aimed at improving the achievement levels of students from disadvantaged areas at school, reserving places in the third level colleges is an important component of this strategy.The commitment in the programme for Government to which the Deputy refers is, however, designed to recognise the particular advantages of attracting bright, committed young people from disadvantaged areas into the teaching profession.  Teachers are important role models both in their schools and in their communities.  While teachers as a whole are compassionate and understanding and those who choose to work in disadvantaged areas would be even more so, those who grew up in areas of significant social and economic disadvantage could be expected to have an enhanced understanding of the challenges their pupils face in their everyday lives.  The fact that a teacher has managed to overcome these challenges, go to college and get a good job is living proof to his or her pupils that it is possible to succeed even against considerable obstacles.The commitment to ensure that places are reserved in the teacher training colleges for students from disadvantaged areas therefore reflects a desire both to ensure that more young people from such areas can join this important and rewarding profession and also to provide strong role models for children in their schools.Third level colleges have been offering a direct entry route for some time, whereby students from disadvantaged areas can usually qualify for a college place with less than the standard CAO points for the relevant year.Back in April 2003, my Department informed each of the colleges of education of its support for the inclusion of the bachelor of education degree programme within the direct application scheme for third level places in order to facilitate socio-economically disadvantaged school leavers who wished to train as primary teachers.Colleges participating may reserve up to 5% of their annual intake figure, exclusive of mature students.  Colleges operating the scheme may also provide other specific support, including financial, to assist and enable students who do not have a tradition of progression to higher education to gain entry to the college and to participate fully in the various aspects of college life.The manner in which the scheme is operated differs from college to college, as each college must take a range of factors into consideration when administering the programme, such as links with other third level institutions, links to local schools, overall enrolment numbers, numbers of applications under direct entry schemes, other local circumstances, etc.In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, this scheme will continue to be implemented and its effectiveness will be kept under review.

They welcome this announcement and fully support the policy that all teacher training colleges reserve places for students from disadvantaged areas.  The message needs to be communicated by the Department to all children from disadvantaged areas that they can gain access to training colleges.  I also welcome this move by the Government on the grounds of equality and fairness.What proportions of students from disadvantaged areas have received places on teacher training courses to date, specifically in the Dublin North-East constituency?  I hope that as a result of the Government's commitment to this issue the number of places for students from disadvantaged areas will greatly increase.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I wish Deputy Terence Flanagan well.  Cuirim fáilte roimhe go dtí an Teach.  The numbers vary within the different colleges, but it is not possible to indicate from which specific constituency people come.  The Deputy will be aware of the increased participation rate in third level education from people in all constituencies, particularly his constituency, which is encouraging.  The percentage intake of disadvantaged students to St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra over the past five years has grown from 0.5% to 1%.  The figure for Mary Immaculate College in Limerick is more encouraging and has been at 5.12%, 5.12% and 4.7%.  It is hitting its target for disadvantaged students and I know some people have been offered places through different schemes.The figures for St. Patrick's College are curious.  It is not that the college is not taking disadvantaged students, but often it does not get enough applications to fill the places available, perhaps because the college has confined the places to students from DEIS and Dublin schools.  I wish to point out, to encourage students, that the college is very generous with support to students once they have been accepted.  Perhaps we need to give students that message.

Gorey is the largest town in the country with just one second level school, Gorey community school.  In the PPP bundle mentioned by the Minister, and by the Taoiseach earlier, we were given the impression that everything is rosy, but it is not.  Has the Minister got a site in Gorey for the new second level school she promised?  If not, why not?  When will she deliver on this needed project and provide this second level facility for Gorey?

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The State Examinations Commission has statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the certificate examinations, including organising the holding of examinations and determining procedures in places where examinations are conducted, including the supervision of examinations.I am informed by the State Examinations Commission that it will again facilitate external candidates to take the leaving certificate examination in 2008.  For years, approximately 4,000 external candidates have taken the leaving certificate examination each year.  Those classified as external candidates include those attending non State-funded schools, VTOS students and independent candidates.  External candidates may be admitted to the leaving certificate examination in one or more subjects on payment of the appropriate fee provided that there is a period of at least two years between the candidate's completion of transition year or the junior cycle, whichever is the later, and the sitting of the leaving certificate examination or, in the case of a candidate who has not been a recognised junior pupil or a transition year pupil, the candidate will have attained the age of 17 years on or before 31 July of the year of examination.These provisions are designed to ensure that a student who has left school will not be in a position to sit the leaving certificate examination earlier than if he or she had remained at school.  Essentially, a student will not be permitted to sit the leaving certificate examination in the year after the junior certificate examination or in the year after transition year.In regard to where an external candidate takes his examinations, each candidate must select a centre for examination and seek the approval of the school principal to sit there.  The candidate will be assigned to that centre provided he or she has obtained approval from the school principal and accommodation is available.  School authorities have been very generous in accommodating external candidates and I place on record my thanks for their support for these students.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Is the State Examinations Commission obliged to find a place to sit the exam or is that the student's responsibility?  I am aware of cases where students who want to sit the exam have been frustrated by local principals.  I know of a particular case where a student took up a full-time position but now wants to do two or three subjects for her leaving certificate, has issues with dyslexia and requires special assistance — a reader — and it has been difficult for her to find the appropriate school in that scenario.  Who is obliged to find the place — the commission or the student?

Students who attend private colleges or grind schools generally have provision made by those schools for the exams.  The once-off external student, however, must go to the local school.  I met a student who did not realise it was her responsibility to do that.Difficulties can arise when a student may have left the local school to attend a private school but then wants to go back to the local school to sit the exam.  Conflicts and considerations arise in that situation.

If a student cannot find a local school to facilitate him, there could be an appeals system within the commission which would then take responsibility for finding an appropriate place for that student to sit his examinations.  There are 4,000 external students, people of all ages, and we must encourage them instead of putting barriers in their way when they are trying to sit their State exams.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers, the scope of which reflects the wide variety of factors that are central to tackling educational disadvantage.  The DEIS action plan is designed to provide children and young people from socio-economically disadvantaged areas with a comprehensive package of extra supports.  DEIS represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing a particular aspect of the problem and adopts a multifaceted and more integrated approach.  Greater cross-departmental and interagency co-operation is also prioritised to ensure a joined-up approach to the provision of services for children at risk.With the roll-out of the DEIS action plan, many of the issues raised in this publication are being addressed, including early education, transition from primary to second level, the role of the family and community, literacy and numeracy, attendance and early school leaving, teacher retention and development, and so on.Just some of the wide range of extra supports being targeted at children in the most disadvantaged areas include the following: special literacy and numeracy programmes with intensive extra tuition to help pupils with difficulties at an early stage; smaller classes; after-school and holiday time supports, including homework clubs and summer camps; extra funding for school books schemes; and school meals.I am also conscious of the positive impact that working with parents in disadvantaged areas can have on their children's progress.  Therefore, the home-school-community liaison scheme has been extended, and a new family literacy initiative is being developed in co-operation with the National Adult Literacy Agency and other partners.This comprehensive package of extra support for children and their parents will improve attainment levels.  I know the scale of the challenges facing children and young people in disadvantaged areas but I am confident that they can be overcome.  Even before the DEIS plan was put in place there was evidence that the extra investment in social inclusion measures made by the Government between 1997 and 2005 had made a difference.  By 2005, some 85.8% of Irish 20-24 year olds had attained upper second-level education or equivalent, up from 82.6% in 2000 and putting Ireland way ahead of the EU average of 77.5%.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I thank the Minister for her reply.  I also welcome the report, which highlights the need to tackle inadequacy in our education system.  Young people from all areas must be helped and encouraged to reach their full potential.  We must tackle illiteracy head-on by making reading materials accessible to young people from an early age.  The Fatima regeneration board has introduced newspapers and magazines as part of its homework club, which will go a long way towards encouraging young people to read more.  Students must have access to a broad range of materials and in this respect additional funding is required, particularly from the Department of Education and Science.Sadly, however, many young people often cannot reach their educational potential because they are caught in a poverty trap.  This can lead to a wide variety of other problems in school, some of which the Minister has mentioned.  If children go to school hungry they cannot concentrate on homework.  A report published last year showed that in my constituency of Dublin South-Central, 28.8% of children in full-time education leave school before the age of 15.  Some 29.2% of children left with a primary education or no full-time education at all.  Additional funding is needed to ameliorate those figures.  We need to get away from labelling schools as being in disadvantaged areas because this further marginalises young people attending them.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I welcome Deputy Catherine Byrne to the House and I note her interest in disadvantaged education.  She put her finger on the matter when she referred to homework clubs and the provision of basic reading materials to improve literacy.  One of the main objectives of our disadvantage plan is to target literacy and numeracy, not just in the context of smaller class sizes but also with programmes such as First Steps, which is for junior infants, as well as focused programmes like maths recovery and reading recovery.  I have watched teachers being trained in this sector on a one-to-one basis and great progress has been made as a result of these developments.  I am sure the Deputy will be glad that children in the homework club are reading newspapers as they will be up to date on current affairs.In a community context, children in disadvantaged schools cannot reach their potential or attain the same standards as others if we do not have the support of their families.  The family literacy programme, which started this year, is an integral part of DEIS.  We are targeting parents to include them in the same manner as we do with the home-school-community liaison programme.  In that way, we will have a better chance not only of keeping children in school but also of improving their literacy levels.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	115	As Deputy Byrne has already pointed out, one of the report's recommendations is to remove the term "disadvantaged" from our vocabulary when dealing with educational issues.  Does the Minister have a view on that?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I deliberately avoided using the term "disadvantaged" to label the new programme.  It is called DEIS, which is delivering equality of opportunity in schools.  It is all about opportunity.  The word "deis" is the Irish word for opportunity, so I took it in that context.  I particularly wanted to use a word that is not an acronym, because the education sector is full of acronyms.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	119	My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects.  Progress in these areas is a vitally important part of our national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.Significant progress is being made in regard to curricular reform and in-service support for science at both primary and post-primary levels.  Science was introduced as a key component in the revised primary school curriculum in 1999 and has been implemented in all schools since September 2003.  A revised syllabus in junior certificate science was introduced in 2003 and was examined for the first time in June 2006.  This syllabus, with its hands-on investigative approach and its new emphasis on scientific process skills, will be instrumental in encouraging more students to continue their study of science at senior level.  A particularly interesting innovation in the revised syllabus is the introduction of the assessment of students' practical work.  This assessment accounts for 35% of marks in the junior certificate examination and is based on the completion of 30 mandatory practical activities carried out during the three-year course and on projects undertaken by students in the final year.Revised syllabuses in leaving certificate physics, chemistry and biology have all been examined for the first time in the past five years.  These three subjects are now included in the first phase of the senior cycle review currently being undertaken by the NCCA.  This revision of the syllabuses is intended to build on the progress achieved at junior cycle level.  Work on the revision of the two remaining leaving certificate subjects — agricultural science and combined physics-chemistry — has also been advanced.Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme.  In that context, €13 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised junior certificate science syllabus.  New and refurbished science labs have also been provided in schools as part of major building projects and through the summer works scheme.In addition, the introduction of each of the revised syllabuses has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.  The strategy for science, technology and innovation sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and to improve the uptake of senior cycle physics and chemistry.  These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach, which is now in place at junior cycle, is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used, and that there is an emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of science in society.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I accept that our objective should be to have a hands-on approach to teaching science.  The reality, however, is that there is a lack of facilities.  Coupled with overcrowded classrooms, especially at senior level, this leads to practical classes being taken on a demonstration level rather than using a hands-on approach.  Will the Minister provide a timetable for the introduction of such a hands-on approach in the leaving certificate?  When will the resources be put in place to deliver that programme?Will the Minister put resources in place to provide for school laboratory technicians in order to establish such classes?  Time and resources are needed to establish practical classes in which pupils can adopt a hands-on approach to science education.  What steps will be taken to ensure a continuous, rolling programme of upskilling teachers on new science and technology developments?  The difficulty with the syllabus approach in this country is that science and technology teachers are not being kept up to date with the latest developments in relevant sectors.

Quite a number of schools have had their laboratories upgraded.  All new schools and school extensions also have state-of-the-art laboratories.

I expect to receive recommendations on that issue.  The important thing, however, is that we will see an uptake at leaving certificate level from the junior certificate.  At junior certificate level, approximately 90% of students, if not more, when one subtracts the external students, take science for the junior certificate examination.  However, the numbers taking physics and chemistry drops to approximately 14% at leaving certificate level.  The hands-on approach to junior cycle science and the investment in laboratories are certainly working.  There are significant link schemes between industry and schools with science teachers being invited to company laboratories to carry out in-service training during the summer.

The required investment is of better use in the other areas I have mentioned.  I have no doubt that if we were to employ laboratory technicians in schools, there would be a knock on demand from all other practical subjects.  If that were the case, it would cost up to €112 million per annum.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	128	It is important to take account of the historical context that gave rise to the differentiation between fee-paying and non fee-paying secondary schools.  This differentiation arises essentially from the arrangements put in place when free second level education was introduced and those arrangements took account specifically of the position of minority religions with dispersed membership, through the creation of the block grant.There are currently 56 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant, two inter-denominational, one Jewish and the remainder Catholic.  Fee-charging schools, with the exception of the Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools for which special arrangements apply, do not receive capitation or related supports.  I have already referred to the block grant, by way of which Protestant fee-charging schools receive funding.  The block grant has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant and Jewish persuasions to attend schools which reflect their denominational ethos, and it includes payments in respect of capitation.  In addition, Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools are eligible for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant, the secretarial grant and caretaking grant.Teachers in fee-charging schools are paid by the State, irrespective of a school's religious ethos. The payment of teachers' salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions.  This may well reflect a long-standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.Minority religion schools also receive capital funding for building projects and have done so under successive Governments on the same basis as other secondary schools, while approximately 50% of capital costs for Catholic fee-charging schools building projects are met by the State.  However, school building projects, whether for fee charging schools or schools in the free education sector, are selected for inclusion on the basis of priority of need.  In that regard the Deputy should note that the proportion of the school building programme spent in fee-charging schools in recent years has been extremely small.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.It would be inappropriate for the State to depart in any fundamental way from the original intent that allowed some schools to opt to remain outside the "free scheme" and continue to charge fees and therefore I do not propose to carry out any review to that end.  This support has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments.However, it is important to take stock at this point.  While continuing to give reasonable support to existing schools, there should be no further development of the sector and accordingly I do not intend to provide state funding for any new fee paying schools.As with all public expenditure measures I will keep the funding arrangements for the schools concerned under review to ensure that they remain consistent with their original policy basis.

We must ensure, for example, to continue to protect the minority religions and that is reflected in the way fee-paying schools are funded.  I  hold the strong view that no new fee paying school will be supported by the State.  In the event of a body offering to set up a voluntary secondary school, I would not support any change in the system.From anecdotal accounts one would get the impression that there has been a major increase in the numbers attending fee-paying schools, but that is not the case.  In the 2006-2007 school year, there were 26,373 pupils in private schools, whereas ten years ago there were 24,200.  The largest increase in pupil numbers has been in Protestant schools.It is important we continue to support fee-paying schools on the basis of their history and minority religions, but I will not support any new schools setting up.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I have no wish to prolong the matter of the answers given by the Taoiseach under oath to the Mahon tribunal, nor have I any wish to concede to the views of those who would want to turn this into a personal and bitter political battle between us.  The Taoiseach will note that in comments I have made on the matter, I have never raised the issue of his marriage or private life, which is of no interest to me.  What is of interest to me, however, is the matter of public service and standards in public life.  I disagree fundamentally with the Taoiseach on several issues in this regard.  Arising from the answers the Taoiseach gave to questions that were put to him, and taking into account that a judge of the tribunal said that some of his comments were polar opposites, it now appears that the collective culture of the Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Green Party Government is that it is perfectly acceptable to receive large cash donations for personal use, and that one does not breach any ethical code as long as one does not do anything wrong.  I disagree fundamentally with that concept.In his address to the House of Commons, prior to the election, the Taoiseach was quoting Daniel O'Connell when he said "Nothing that is politically right can be morally wrong".  Will the Taoiseach perhaps answer my questions in this House, the forum of the people?  On 10 September 1997, arising from comments made here on the Dunnes payment to the late Mr. Haughey, the Taoiseach said in the House: "Mr. Haughey thereby laid himself open to the possibility ‘that political or financial favours could be sought in return for such gifts, or even be given without being sought'."  The Taoiseach went on to say: "if politicians are to give an effective service to all their constituents, or to all the citizens of the State, they must not be under a financial obligation to some constituents or some citizens only".  He went on to say further:  "we should not require of others what we are not prepared to practise ourselves".  Finally, the Taoiseach said: "We must make it clear in this House by our actions that we are going to insist on the highest standards in public life.  It would be very dangerous, if the message were ever to go out, either here or abroad, however ill-founded, that Government here operates on the principle of backhanders, or that there are golden circles with a high entrance fee.  We must nip that notion in the bud once and for all".  The Taoiseach concluded by saying: "The public is entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, officials and, above all, Ministers." It is a core value outlined by the Taoiseach, who spent 18 hours giving evidence before the tribunal, and there are still many questions.  They were the  standards the Taoiseach applied to Mr. Haughey.  They were the standards the Taoiseach set down.  Why do these standards do not apply to himself?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	134	There are two questions, first on the question of the polar opposites, I again refer Deputy Kenny to the complete transcript of 20 September 2007.  Judge Flaherty used the phrase, "polar opposites" but I encourage Deputy Kenny to read the entire transcript and see the context of the exchange rather than zoom in on one soundbite.  Judge Flaherty said the reason I gave the tribunal in public session had never previously been offered by me.  When it was pointed out to the judge that I had put that view forward in a comprehensive statement last May she accepted that clarification.  I gave the detailed reason in that statement and set out the exact context.  Deputy Kenny has taken one soundbite, which is not a reasonable thing to do.I have been a huge supporter of rules and standards regarding the declaration and recording of anything received by Members.  I have complied fully since this became a requirement in 1995.  I have given a full account of what I received.  Those regulations were not in force then but I would have given the facts if the regulations had been in force.  I made it clear that I considered the money to be loans and not contributions.  Last week Deputy Kenny tried to put a figure on the sums of money.  From three different sources I received about forty-seven thousand and paid back just short of ninety-eight thousand.  I have dealt with the matter completely and in a proper fashion.  I have not contravened anything I said.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I find this distressing.  The Taoiseach said "the public is entitled to have an absolute guarantee of the financial probity and integrity of their elected representatives, officials and, above all, Ministers".  The Taoiseach, as a Minister, was in receipt of serious cash donations.  He moved up to €300,000, in today's value, in four major lodgments which he has been unable to explain.  The problem I have with the Taoiseach is that he does not apply the standards to himself that he applies to others.  If it was wrong for Mr. Charles Haughey to receive money it was also wrong for the Taoiseach.  No Minister in the current Government has had the courage to say that.  The message this sends about our country and the way we do business does down every Member of the House.  Every time politicians speak they are branded as being all the same.  They are not all the same.  Why does the Taoiseach not apply the same standards to himself as he did to Mr. Charles Haughey?The Green Party, who are the Taoiseach's colleagues in Government and are not here today, hold the view that  taking money was wrong.

Deputy Sargent said the Taoiseach taking money from businesses and businessmen was completely inappropriate and improper, unethical and wrong.  We know from last week's vote that the Green Party has adopted a vow of silence on this matter.  Today's Daily Mail refers to a written agreement made by the Taoiseach with the Green Party’s negotiating team that he would resign if the tribunal found he had taken bribes — which claim I do not make against him — had not co-operated with the tribunal or that his evidence was unreliable.  Why was it wrong for Mr. Haughey to accept money and not wrong for the Taoiseach?  Why is there a different standard, in view of the Taoiseach’s words to the House?  Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Green Party negotiated an agreement with him on the basis of waiting for the tribunal to conclude its findings and of his resigning if he were found to be guilty of any of the three matters I cited in the fact finding conclusions of the tribunal.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	138	Deputy Kenny knows there is no written agreement.  He knows the view of the Green Party, expressed here last week, that they would await the findings of the full tribunal.  He also knows that the allegation I have been asked to answer is that I received money from Owen O'Callaghan in relation to certain issues put forward in different circumstances to the tribunal.  The tribunal is dealing with those issues.  I will be cleared of those allegations because I received nothing from Owen O'Callaghan.  I could mention several things regarding Deputy Kenny's party but I will not do so.  I have never done so in 30 years of political life.  I have served most of my political career and I will not pursue that line.  At one time in a 30 year political life I received money from two sets of very close friends and paid the money back in full and with interest.  One of Deputy Kenny's spin doctors persists in referring to three hundred thousand.  The amount in question is forty-eight thousand and I paid back just short of ninety-nine thousand.  All the evidence of that is there.  Deputy Kenny knows that.  I know he is being forced by others to continue to say this.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	145	We should not have to legislate for standards.  We should have them.Six years ago the Government published a national health strategy which stated that by the end of 2003 no adult would have to wait for longer than six months for a procedure and no child would have to wait for longer than three months.  A report by Fergal Bowers for RTE today says that at present 12,000 adults are waiting for longer than six months and 2,200 children are waiting for longer than three months for procedures.At the beginning of September, the Health Service Executive, which was established to sort out the problems in the health service, introduced a total embargo on recruitment of all staff, including nurses, doctors and paramedics.  Yesterday, the Health Service Executive extended that embargo for a further month.  The Minister for Health and Children says this will not impact on patient care.  Nevertheless, beds have been closed in Tullamore, Clonmel, Galway and Limerick and 40 staff have been let go in Sligo.  One would expect this kind of month-to-month operation by the HSE in a country on the brink of bankruptcy, not in one as well off as this one, supposedly, is.As the Health Service Executive attempts to claw back the €220 million it says it has overspent so far this year, it is clearly embarking, presumably with the approval of the Government, on a series of health cuts.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the observation of his predecessor and mentor, the late Mr. Charles Haughey, that health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Additional expenditure for the HSE this year amounts to €1.2 billion.  Its allocation for this year is €15 billion, 25% higher than it was two years ago.  I am sure the Deputy will accept that all my colleagues who administer Departments and agencies under their aegis must comply with the expenditure position.  It is in addition to a €1.2 billion increase in funding that at the end of August, the HSE was over budget by €222 million.  The HSE predicted it would over-spend by between €300 million and €350 million this year if it did not take corrective measures.  I do not believe the Deputy is advocating an over-spend as it was a Government to which his colleagues were party that introduced the measures that stipulated that health boards should live within their budgets, and that was at a time when budgets were much less than they are today.  Budgets have quadrupled in less than ten years.  The HSE, like every other organisation, must adhere as close as possible to, hopefully within, the high allocation it receives through the budget.On the other issue, I do not know whether the figures are official.  I received a briefing on this and I am not clear from where those figures came.  They do not appear to have come from the HSE or from the Department and for that reason, I cannot say whether they are right.  On the general position, one million patients are being seen at a rate of 100,000 per month.  The figures available today suggest there are 41,000 people on hospital waiting lists.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund is doing a superb job.  Persons on a waiting list for more than three months are asked to contact the NTPF.As I mentioned in the House previously, some hospitals do not refer patients to the NTPF.  I do not know if some of the hospitals mentioned in the report are among them.  Total acute hospital discharges are up by 315,000 to 1.083 million, a 41% increase.  Apart from the work undertaken by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, the HSE has, despite the many challenges and difficulties it is facing, dramatically increased the number of patients treated.  Even if there are 41,000 people on the waiting list — I am not disputing this as I do not know whether that figure is correct — this is only a small percentage of the turnover.I take this opportunity to state that anyone on a waiting list for more than 12 months and those who come within the three months' category should contact the National Treatment Purchase Fund.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	147	The Taoiseach's recitation of figures will be poor consolation to those people who are waiting for an operation.I wish to deal in particular with the HSE embargo.  This type of staggering from in one month announcing an embargo on recruitment to the next month announcing its continuation is hardly the way to run the health service.  It is also inconsistent.  I do not know if the Taoiseach read the "Situations Vacant" column in last week's newspapers which contained an advertisement for a chief nursing officer, apparently to advise the Minister for Health and Children on nursing matters.  This country hardly needs more advisers on health.  What we need is more nurses and medical personnel in the system.  It is a little incongruous that at a time when the Health Service Executive has a complete embargo on the recruitment of medical staff, the Minister remains unaffected and is free to advertise and hire more advisers in the health area.Does the Taoiseach have any appreciation of the worry, concern and sometimes pain suffered by people on hospital waiting lists?  In effect, the Taoiseach said that because one million patients go through the system, 41,000 is not a significant number?  This shows a poor understanding of the conditions which people, particularly those dependent on the public health service, have to endure.  What will the Government do, if anything, about the embargo imposed by the Health Service Executive?  Does the Taoiseach believe it is satisfactory that our health service and hospitals are managed in such a way that they stagger from one month to the next?  There was an embargo on recruitment of staff last month. That has been extended for another month and it may continue until Christmas.  Surely, it is possible, given the large apparatus established under the Health Service Executive, to organise matters so that people can obtain the treatment they deserve without having to wait for six, 12 or more months?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Let us be clear on this point.  The HSE is in receipt of €15 billion in Exchequer funding.  Its funding has increased by more than 10% per annum in recent years.  The allocation is based on the HSE's assessment of need, as is the case with every other agency.  I am not sure if the Deputy is advocating that any sector, health, education or otherwise, should disregard its agreed annual allocation and incur a huge over-spend.  That is not possible.  The HSE is not advocating it should do this.  It has, having examined its figures at the end of five months, noted it has to date spent almost €300 million of its €15 billion allocation and has taken corrective action.  I understand that will affect only a few hundred of its 120,000 posts over the remainder of the year.  The Deputy should put this in scale.I do not want to get into the mathematics of this.  However, the Deputy made a statement in respect of the number of people on hospital waiting lists.  There has been a dramatic improvement in regard to hospital waiting lists.  From the benchmark used by the HSE, the number of people on waiting lists for surgical admissions and in other fields has been halved in recent years. I accept people remain on hospital waiting lists and I agree no one should have to wait for more than 12 months for treatment — I have no difficulty agreeing with this — but the HSE has dramatically increased its throughput.I accept that anyone waiting for a medical appointment suffers a certain amount of anxiety.  However, recently published independent research carried out by the UCD School of Public Health and Population Science in respect of hospital waiting lists states that waiting times for hospital admissions for 91% of patients is less than three months, with 76% of in-patients stating they were admitted to hospital immediately upon being told they needed admission.  A further 11% of people were admitted within one month and a further 4% were admitted within three months.  I am not saying that is perfect but it is not bad.  It is a significant improvement on the position at any time during my career in this House.  That must be taken into account.  The survey also examined what people had to say in terms of GP and inpatient services and referred to people's high level of satisfaction with hospital services.  Some 83% of hospital inpatients felt they had been treated with dignity and respect, 83% of inpatients would recommend the service to another and two thirds of inpatients and almost 60% of outpatients rated their experience as excellent or very good.

It will be a challenge to get it perfect.  That is why we are providing €15 billion and 120,000 people to improve it.  That is what the Government is committed to.  The HSE, it is hoped, will be able to get back within its figures in the remainder of the year and move on with the large increase it will again receive in 2008.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I rise to pay tribute to the late Joe Sherlock, friend and comrade over many years, and an outstanding representative of the people.Three weeks ago when I attended his funeral in Cork and stood at his graveside, I was struck by the great affection that the people of Cork had for Joe Sherlock and the great respect they had for him.  I remember in particular, when the funeral was over, people who had gathered in the cemetery simply standing in silent respect for somebody who had served the people of Cork so well.  That was not surprising because Joe Sherlock had been continuously a public representative for 40 years serving as town councillor, member of Cork County Council, Member of Dáil Éireann and Member of Seanad Éireann.He was elected to this House in 1981 as the sole representative of the Workers Party.  It was a great challenge not alone to be a new Member of the House but to be the sole representative of a political party at a particularly politically turbulent time in the history of this country.  His was never an easy road in politics.  He lost his seat in 1982, regained it in 1987, retained it in 1989, lost it again in 1992, won it back in 2002, serving in the Seanad in the intervening period from 1993 to 1997.One of the things of which Joe Sherlock was particularly proud was chairing the proceedings of this House as an Acting Chairman.  His work as a representative was not confined to politics.  He was also an active trade unionist.  He was, for many years, secretary of the Mallow No. 2 branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, representing the workers in the Irish Sugar Company in Mallow where he worked and participating in the representation nationally of sugar company workers throughout the country.Joe Sherlock was passionate about politics, sometimes a little too passionate.  He was intolerant of bureaucracy standing in the way of the rights of the people he represented.  He had a great commitment to many issues, for example, Mallow General Hospital, on behalf of which he campaigned for many hears.  He did not have long to enjoy his retirement from this House but he was particularly proud of the election of his son, Seán, to succeed him.  In many respects, therefore, he died a happy man.Bhí grá faoi leith aige don Gaeilge agus do cúrsaí cultúrtha i gcoitinne.  Nuair a bhí sé i mBaile Átha Cliath i rith na seachtaine dos na suíonna Dála, téadh sé go minic go dtí na hamharclanna agus na ceolárais ar fud na cathrach.  Tírghráthóir ab ea Joe Sherlock, i ndáiríre.  Cáilliúnt mór is ea a bás don Lucht Oibre agus go háirithe dá chlann.  Ba mhaith liom mo chómhbhrón agus cómhbhrón Páirtí an Lucht Oibre a ghabháil lena chlann — Joseph, Úna agus ár chómhghleacaithe, an Teachta Seán Sherlock.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	155	On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I extend my sympathy to Deputy Eamon Gilmore, Deputy Seán Sherlock and the Labour Party on the death of Joe Sherlock.  A proud Cork man, Joe was a long-serving Member of the House.  He was born in Kildorrery in north Cork seven decades ago.  From a young age he showed great commitment to the people of north Cork and to improving the lives of those in the community who were less well off.  He had a long career, almost 20 years, in the sugar factory in Mallow and his experience there helped him to understand the difficulties of working people and their need to be represented at local level.His election to Mallow Urban District Council 40 years ago marked the beginning of a successful political career that spanned more than four decades.  In 1974, in recognition of the work he undertook, he was elected to and was honoured to serve on Cork County Council.  He was first elected to this House in 1981.  He lost his seat in 1982, regained it in 1987, retained it in 1989, and lost it again in 1992.  He was elected to the Seanad on the labour panel and in the 2002 election he was again elected a Deputy.Joe was always passionate about politics and used the Order of Business here, right up to the summer, to raise issues.  If I answered him once on the issue of the rents Bill I answered him a thousand times as he kept returning to the issue.  He knew what my answer would be but he believed the issue should be dealt with in a different way and continued to put his view forward.My dealings with Joe Sherlock go back a long time.  I was a Government Whip when he was elected to this House, leading his parliamentary party.  When its membership increased from one to three he continued doing the work of Whip and leader.  He was very straight and honest in terms of how matters stood in relation to voting.  I remember one occasion when I was Whip and his party decided not to support the Government, but he always made it clear to me when that was to happen.  I still remember the circumstances very well.Joe Sherlock was a committed public representative whose dedication and loyalty to the people of Mallow and Cork will be sadly missed.  I join with Deputy Gilmore and Members of the House in extending our sympathy to Ellen, Joseph, Seán, Úna and Joe's colleagues and friends.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I am honoured and saddened to pay a warm personal tribute to the late former Deputy Joe Sherlock on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I sympathise with Deputy Gilmore and with the young Deputy Sherlock on the loss of his father.Joe Sherlock was a thoroughly decent man.  He had a distinctive voice that one could hear in the corridors of the House long before one saw him.  At every stage of his public life he was truly a servant of his people in the trade unions, on local authorities and in the Dáil and Seanad.  On his retirement he gave an interview in which he said:I have always aimed for integrity and honesty in my dealings with people.  It would be great to be remembered as such.  I don't want any great plaudits; just to have it said that I did my best.That is certainly how he will be remembered in the House and in Cork East.In his 40 years of public life, during which he travelled up and down to Dublin week after week and, like many others of his generation, attending meetings all over east and north Cork and other places in draughty halls on bad wet nights, Joe Sherlock, God rest him, had a genuine belief in what he stood for.  He campaigned for issues concerning Mallow town in 1967 and, thereafter, when he was elected to the UDC.  He raised the issue of Mallow hospital from the Opposition benches on many occasions, campaigned on issues relating to the sugar plant and, as the Taoiseach rightly mentioned, continually campaigned for a rents Bill.  Week after week, even when his voice was not as strong as in previous years, he would ask the then Minister, Deputy Noel Ahern, when he would address the issue of a rents Bill.  I notice it has slipped off the legislative programme entirely.  Maybe, as a monument to Joe Sherlock, the Taoiseach might reinstate it.We have lost a colleague in the Dáil and Seanad and I sympathise with Joe's wife Ellen, his daughter Úna and sons Joseph and Seán, who is a Member of this House.  They have lost a husband, a father and a person who had the genuine respect and love of the people in his constituency.  I welcome Deputy Seán Sherlock to the House.  He is here on merit, by the vote of the people.  I share something with him in having come into the House after the death of my own father, as did the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, and many others.  If I may tender some advice to him, I suggest that, at times of political difficulty, he should simply ask: "What would Joe have done about this?"I remember canvassing as a young and naive Deputy in a Cork by-election in 1979.  I arrived with my loudspeaker and all the gear to speak outside Doneraile church in the driving rain and I set up my little camp across the road from the statue of Canon Sheehan.  Joe Sherlock came out of the church with a large entourage beside him, his support group for what he wanted to say.  By the time he had set up his microphone most of the people had left, because of the rain.  He came over to me and said: "We might as well say a few words — maybe Canon Sheehan himself might listen to us."He was a thorough gentleman and the people of Cork East sent to this House, and to the Seanad for many years, somebody of whom Irish people can be very proud.  Mar a dúirt tú Eamon, a chara, nuair a bhí sé sa Suíochán, úsáidfeadh sé beagáinín Gaeilge chun chuile Theachta a ghlaoch.

I was deeply saddened to hear of the death of Joe.  Untimely deaths such as this put everything into perspective.  Only weeks previously Joe celebrated what was undoubtedly one of the proudest days of his life when Seán succeeded him in representing Cork East for the Labour Party.  I know from speaking to my colleague, Senator Dan Boyle, that Joe was hugely involved in the campaign, as he had been in other campaigns over years, such as the campaign for Mallow hospital and the sugar factory, as my colleagues have said.  The work put into those campaigns by Joe Sherlock shows the level of feeling and empathy he had for the ordinary working people of north Cork.  I believe this stems from his own background in the agricultural industry and, in particular, the sugar factory, which in turn led to his involvement in the trade union movement.  His understanding of his locality and the people of north Cork was a significant factor in his ability to hold a seat for the Workers' Party in a predominantly agricultural constituency.Joe was a very hard worker and was held in very deep affection by his constituents.  He went on to contest the seat first for the Democratic Left and, later, for the Labour Party, never failing to remember his duty to the people whom he met on the farms and in the factories all around Cork.  Undoubtedly his presence in the constituency will be sorely missed, though I have no doubt his son Seán will continue his good work.This year is the tenth anniversary of the passing of another great Labour figure, Jim Kemmy, and today we mourn the loss of another great socialist, Joe Sherlock.  Like others in the House, we will miss other aspects of Joe Sherlock.  As Deputy Kenny said, we will miss his distinctive voice but I will always remember his smile and his kind words for new Deputies.  I express my profound sympathy and that of my party to the Sherlock family and Joe's friends but especially to his wife, Ellen, and his children Úna, Joseph and Seán, who now sits in this House as Joe's very able successor.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

I also extend our sympathy to Joe's widow, Ellen, his sons Seán, our colleague in the Dáil, Joe junior and his daughter Úna, as well as to the extended Sherlock family and all the bereaved.  I and others who knew Joe Sherlock better never believed that, after the parting of the ways of our respective routes in politics, he was anything other than what he had always been.  I and others have always sincerely respected Joe for being a republican, a socialist and, as I learned from my own experience of coming into this House, a gentleman.  His quiet and respectful manner and his ease with people, already referred to in the case of new Deputies, was something very much noted and appreciated.  I have no doubt that the views I have expressed are the observations of many in my party and I happy to put those views of Joe on the official record today.  Like previous speakers I will certainly miss his unique style and his particular use of language in this House, which was a feature of certain aspects of the day's schedule in which Joe was always a participant.  The short time he lived after his retirement from the Houses of the Oireachtas is a signal to us all of how short life can be and reminds us to be mindful of the passage of time in all our cases.I again extend my sympathy to Joe's son, Seán, who is present today and I have no doubt he will convey the sympathy of all colleagues to his family.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Joe Sherlock was in every sense an old-fashioned gentleman.  The few women here know that he stood back if there was a lady present.  That is not very common nowadays, certainly not in this House.  He was a terrific campaigner for Mallow.  Almost every time I met him after becoming Minister for Health and Children he raised something to do with Mallow Hospital.  After the hospital had come first in the first hygiene audit I told him it was doing so well it did not need anything else.  Shortly before the general election when we were coming to the end of the debate on either the Medical Practitioners Bill or the Pharmacy Bill, I told the officials I thought we had reached the final speaker when suddenly Joe Sherlock arrived and spoke about Mallow Hospital.  I reminded him that the legislation had nothing to do with the hospital but he never missed an opportunity to put forward its case and in other instances, the case for his constituents.Joe Sherlock was quietly effective.  I knew that he had experienced bad health in recent years but when I inquired after his health, he always spoke positively.  When I heard about his death, I thought it was sad that he had not had an opportunity to enjoy his retirement.Unlike many parents here, he was proud of the fact that his son was going into politics.  Deputy Seán Sherlock is probably unique because there are few children of politicians nowadays who are anxious to follow in their parents' footsteps.  His father particularly hoped he would succeed him and I am sure he was very proud of his success in the recent general election.  He has a hard act to follow.  May his father rest in peace.  We will all miss him very much.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I join my colleagues in expressing sympathy on the recent death of my late colleague Joe Sherlock.  I worked with Joe since 1982 and can vouch for the fact that he was a hard-working public representative who was uncompromising in his work for the constituency.   That he was elected to many bodies over 40 years was proof of the esteem in which he was held in the constituency of Cork East.  When I spoke to him before the last general election, he was hopeful that his son would be elected and on the night of the election he was very proud that he had succeeded.  I am sure he is looking down from above at us and wishing Deputy Sherlock and the rest of us well.I extend to Deputy Sherlock, Joe, Úna, his wife, Ellen, brothers and extended family my sympathy and that of the Fianna Fáil organisation in Cork East on Joe's sad death such a short time after he left this House.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

Many loved him.  He was extremely sincere which came across in the way he spoke.  He was also passionate about the issues on which he felt strongly.  I saw him in action.  He was a gentleman but woe betide anyone who got on his wrong side when he was on a roll about an issue about which he felt passionate.  He was successful because he worked hard for the people.  Everybody could go to him and many did across the constituency and he helped them.  From Mallow to Midleton, to Ballycotton and Youghal, Joe could turn up anywhere and often did.I extend my sympathy to Deputy Sherlock, to Joe's family and the Labour Party on the unexpected and sad loss of a legend.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12718	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I sincerely thank the leaders of all the political parties, of all persuasions, for those kind and wonderful words.  I thank too the staff of the House whose expressions of sympathy in the past few weeks have made us proud of the fact that when our father was a Member, he acquitted himself well, was well liked and did his best for the people he represented.Our grief for our father is personal but to be able to share it so publicly in many respects and that so many have expressed sympathy with us leaves us proud.  Our hearts are warmed by the fact that the man endeared himself to so many.I cannot say too much today but with the indulgence of the House will read some lines from a letter I received from a former colleague and dear friend of my father's who campaigned with him over many years:Joe epitomised for me all that is good, fine and noble in politics.  I was so moved to hear you speak so proudly on Thursday [the day of the funeral] about his genuine commitment to the Republicanism of Wolfe Tone and of the French Revolution, of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity, because that was what I saw Joe Sherlock live when I had the privilege of working with him.  He was an instinctive socialist, and found ease with the noble of spirit and of heart.  He thought and fought from the heart.  He could readily distinguish between nationalism and republicanism, and always knew a sham when it presented.  His was an abiding humanity, a part of himself that he could not detach or shake off.  His volcanic ability for anger never failed.  He never had to feign it — his honesty valve was set so high!For the very many of us who had the privilege of walking in Joe's considerable shadow, I must say that it was a rare privilege.  It was enriching and exciting.  He gave hope and leadership, and enabled persons to dream, and to believe that there was and is a better way of doing things.  One of the other great ironies is that while Joe was never in government, he achieved more for the people of North Cork as a campaigning politician than a Mercedes full of government ministers ever have — he made a real impact on people's lives.We should not forget Joe, and though his main monument is built in our hearts, we must not leave his inspiration slip.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Three months or 12 weeks have passed since the House met before the recess and I have become concerned regarding the structure the Taoiseach has in mind for the committee system in the House.  While a meeting was held today with the Government Whip, no information was forthcoming as to the number or nature of committees to be established.  Members are dealing with legislation without having committees to which Bills may be referred.  Progress must be made in this regard and should have been achieved before this.Does the Taoiseach accept the committees of the Houses are not instruments of Government?  They are instruments of the Dáil to deal with its business and, as such, does he accept they should reflect the proportionality of the parties as represented in the House?  The Government has an in-built majority on all such committees, which are instruments of the Dáil and not of the Government.  The Taoiseach should comment in this regard.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The Deputy has raised a number of points.  The Government is anxious to set up the committees and to get them going.  Not many changes have been proposed.  I understand that two or three changes have been suggested, on which I hope agreement can be reached, and the Government Whip was endeavouring to do so today.  Most of the other committees will remain intact.The representation of parties in the Dáil will be reflected in the committees.  While this happens automatically, it has always been the practice that the committees of the House are chaired by the Government side, with the exception of those that are considered to be what were termed many decades ago as being watchdog committees, such as the Committee of Public Accounts.  Similarly, the committee on European Affairs was established to oversee the enormous volume of directives and data that have been coming through from Europe.  Arguments have also been made regarding some other committees.  However, for the Government to get through its business and move legislation and issues through, while representation will reflect the membership of the House, it is important that such committees should be chaired by supporters of the Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I will make an observation in this regard.  There are no cases in which legislation was held up by chairmen who were non-governmental Members.  The Government will have majorities on every committee because of the manner in which this is structured.  I sent to the Taoiseach's office a document outlining the basis of what takes place in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I refer to the d'Hondt mechanism that applies in many countries in Europe.  It would provide proportional representation to the parties in the House and would not preclude work from being done.  The purpose of such committees, which are instruments of the Dáil rather than of the Government, is to deal with legislation that comes before them.  While the Taoiseach might claim that Members of Government parties should chair the vast majority of such committees, that is no reason to assert that legislation would be held up because that would not be the case given that the Government would command a majority on every committee.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	174	As Deputy Kenny knows, chairmen of committees are vital in trying to progress the agenda.  While the representation of the House will be reflected in the committees, perhaps we can agree on what committees will be established.  The Government has already stated it is prepared to extend some positions to Opposition Members.  Were such matters wrapped up, it would be ready to move with the agreement of the Whips.

This work could have been done before now.  Although I have not yet received details from the Taoiseach, I believe strongly that this should be reflected in the representation the people sent to the House.  This principle is fundamental.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I agree with Deputy Kenny on this issue and express concern regarding the delay in the formation of the committees of the House.  Such committees do not deal merely with legislation, they also deal with important matters such as consideration of the Estimates.  Does the Taoiseach intend to schedule debates on Estimates in the House pending the establishment of the committees, which, in due course will consider the relevant Estimates themselves?In respect of legislation, I note the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill 2005 is back on the Order Paper.  The Taoiseach may recall this Bill was introduced to enable the Government to wind up tribunals of inquiry.  My recollection is that the Green Party in particular expressed much concern regarding that Bill on its publication.  Does restoration to the Order Paper of that Bill have the support of the entire Government?  What are the Taoiseach's plans regarding its introduction to the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	185	The Bill in question was published at the end of 2005 and an Order for Second Stage is to be made.  Thereafter the debate will take place.On committees, the Government recommends only some minor changes.  I refer to a committee on Northern Ireland to which the Government has been committed for some years.  In addition, it has proposed a committee in which it is intended to deal with children's issues and related issues.  Obviously, using the d'Hondt system would change the entire position.  In the last Dáil, the Opposition held three chairs, including the Committee of Public Accounts, and it also held some of the vice-chair positions.  Perhaps we could make progress on the basis of something near that.  The Whip has made a suggestion that we can continue with the full range of committees.

In the absence of committees there is no provision for addressing the serious matters that he highlights.  I asked this of the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, last Thursday and he indicated he had no issue with the matter being facilitated if the whips would agree.  Also, will the Taoiseach indicate to the Chief Whip that the matter is something to which the whips could agree in the course of their deliberations tomorrow?Second, given the impending crisis in the pharmacy sector, which is relevant to the Order of Business, there are serious concerns about the contentious new payment system being introduced by the HSE.  Will the Government bring forward the Pharmacy (No. 2) Bill in order that these serious matters can be addressed in this House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	189	As I stated earlier on Question Time, the Committee of Public Accounts had raised a number of issues and the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance has replied to those issues.  I am sure they can be taken up within the Committee of Public Accounts when it is up and running again.Preparation has commenced on developing a framework for the Pharmacy (No. 2) Bill on clarification of policy objectives following the enactment of the Pharmacy Act 2007, but it has nothing to do with the contracts.

I raise this in a non-partisan way.  The issue that has been raised with the Taoiseach so far is not merely who will be the chair or vice-chair, or even the number of committees.  There is a significant difference between the select committees and committees which have a different and wider role, for example, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of which I have been a member for a long time — since 1993 — and which I sought to establish in 1987.  These committees have not had their functions defined and we need time in the House to discuss that.  For example, is the committee I mentioned, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to be responsible to this House and autonomous from the Department of Foreign Affairs, and what is the difference between the committee when it discusses issues such as the Iraq war, the Estimates, or legislation, the amount of which is small?  We have never had time in the House to discuss the fundamental role of committees.  Are they to be scrutiny committees, committees for the processing of legislation, committees in the European model for the introduction of legislation, or for seriously amending legislation, etc.?As someone who is here for more than 20 years, it is not a matter of who will fill the posts and it is not really a matter for the whips.  We need time in the Parliament to discuss what are the most appropriate terms of reference for the committees.  This is an urgent matter because after the committees are established by order, which will be introduced by the Government Whip, it will be too late to change the terms of reference and the committee chairpersons sitting as the representatives of the Government.It is a serious issue that the chairs of committees are the property of the Executive.  It is a very serious issue in the comparative politics in the European Union of which we are members.  Therefore, I am making a proper request for Government time to discuss the role of the different forms of committee in the House, with consideration and balancing of their terms of reference, the degree of their autonomy and their responsibility to Parliament and to the Executive.  After that, we can get on to the much lesser stuff of who will fill the positions.

That is for others in his party to do.  As a Member of Parliament who has sat on committees and who regularly attends committees, I make the case.  I also should confess an interest in that it is a matter upon which I, as an academic, have written.It is really absurd to be using the committees the way we are.  One of the committees on which I served for more than a decade and a half has been governed more by the availability of a room than by the importance of the issue.  The committees are governed by the availability of a room and the availability of staff, minutes published six or seven months later etc.  I am simply saying it does not matter.  Because we got away with it before in a bad way is no excuse for saying that now, at the beginning of a new session, we must do it in the same old, deadly bad way.

Would he reconsider introducing that Bill and ensuring some control of advertising in the context of the abuse of alcohol?

Higgins.  There will be at least 50 backbenchers in Fianna Fáil who will expect to survive by virtue of their work on the committees.  We need to make the committees meaningful.  Whatever about issues on which the Taoiseach has his mind made up, they must be made meaningful, as Deputy Higgins requests.Recently there was a run on the Northern Rock bank and the British authorities stepped in to provide deposit protection and indicated they will provide deposit protection up to seven and a half times that which is enjoyed in Ireland by depositors.  We need to move rapidly so we do not leave Irish savers exposed and so we do not see Irish savers considering moving to a different jurisdiction to get protection.  Can the Taoiseach indicate that there is consideration of a new deposit protection scheme for Irish savers so we match what is available?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This Bill started out as a very short item of legislation.  Just a few short sections were needed to complement the regulations which I made last February to transpose the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive or MiFID into Irish law.  The whole new MiFID regime comes into effect for the industry across the European Union with effect from 1 November next.  While the deadline for transposition of the directive was 1 February 2007, the relatively long lead-in time before it comes into effect was sought by industry throughout the EU to allow it to train staff in the new provisions and especially to make the extensive updatings required to its IT systems.The transposing of the MiFID statutory instrument is Statutory Instrument No. 60 of 2007, and it is called the European Communities (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations, 2007.  Given the volume and complexity of these regulations that run to 259 pages, it was perhaps inevitable that subsequent close scrutiny by industry and the Financial Regulator would identify a few areas where clarification, amendment or correction might be appropriate.  I was pleased to be able to meet these concerns in the amending regulations which I signed last week.The core issue that needed to be addressed in this Bill was the requirement to introduce penalties at national level for breaches of the new MiFID provisions.  Minor infringements were taken care of in the MiFID statutory instrument of last February, but the scale of the penalties for conviction on indictment for breaches of the new MiFID legislation, namely, fines of up to €10 million and-or ten years imprisonment, is such that primary legislation is required.  That requirement for primary legislation was the immediate reason for bringing forward this Bill.However, it is also necessary to empower the Financial Regulator to be able to levy fees on the financial services sector towards the cost of implementing its new MiFID functions and responsibilities in the same way as arises for other regulatory provisions enforced by the Financial Regulator.Finally, in this context, it is necessary to repeal the Stock Exchange Act 1995 as its provisions are being superseded by the MiFID statutory instrument.  I wish to make clear to Deputies that the penalties involved — fines of up to €10 million and-or ten years imprisonment — are not unique to this legislation.  Such penalties are already set out in the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005.The MiFID directive is one of the most significant items of EU financial services legislation agreed in recent times and applies to both investment firms and credit institutions when providing investment services.  The aim of the MiFID directive is to create a pan-European market in investment products by replacing a patchwork of national rules with harmonised EU-wide regulation and investor protection so as to allow investment firms to sell investment products and services outside their home markets, across the Union, based on a single licence from their home country regulator.The MiFID also aims to increase transparency and to reduce costs for users of financial instruments such as equities and shares, bonds and derivatives, for example, credit or commodity derivatives or financial contracts for differences.  This is being achieved through standardised rules on the dissemination of quotes and on pre and post-trade transparency, as well as best execution practices.The MiFID directive replaces the 1993 Investment Services Directive, the ISD.  The effectiveness of the ISD's "passport" had been undermined by member states imposing their own local consumer protection requirements.  Investment firms wishing to trade across the EU had, heretofore, to comply with 25 sets of rules.  It was essential, therefore, that investor protection provisions in this area be harmonised and also updated across the Union so that investors could avail of greater competition in investment firms' services on a cross-border basis.  It was also important to bring new services such as investment advice and new financial instruments such as derivatives within the scope of the legislation.A significant development under MiFID is the creation of a new regime for investment firms who buy and sell shares on "own account" outside of a regulated market — known as "systematic internalisers".  It clarifies that the operation of an electronic-based trading system that matches buy and sell orders, known as a multilateral trading facility, MTF, is covered by the MiFID passport.  Consequently, all share transactions will no longer be required to be executed in a stock exchange, thus facilitating competition from multilateral trading facilities.The MiFID-related provisions in this Bill are important and urgent because they need to be in place in advance of the "going live" date for this directive of 1 November next.  Similarly, the Stock Exchange Act must be repealed under this Act from that date.This directive is a further element of the comprehensive and detailed EU-wide framework for regulation of financial services which is implemented in Ireland by the Financial Regulator.  Arising from developments in global financial markets in recent weeks, I wish to reiterate briefly a number of key points which I have previously highlighted regarding the quality of Ireland's financial system and its regulatory regime.The single most important point to be made in the national context is that Ireland's banking system is well-capitalised, profitable, liquid and soundly regulated.  This is confirmed by the conclusions of the recently published IMF report which also noted that the Central Bank is satisfied major lenders here have a solid financial base.  As far as the effectiveness of the Irish regulatory system is concerned, the IMF report explicitly acknowledged the strengthening of the financial regulatory and supervisory system in Ireland over recent years which conforms to international best practice standards.It is important to highlight the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, CBFSAI, integrates within a single institutional structure both the supervision of individual financial firms by the Financial Regulator and the monitoring of overall financial stability, which is the responsibility of the Governor of the Central Bank.  This structure yields significant advantages in terms of the appropriate co-ordination of these two activities under the current legislative framework.  In addition, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland operates within the overall context of the euro system and the European Central Bank which has ensured a consistent and coherent approach across the euro area to addressing current uncertainty in financial markets.In contributing to the further development of financial services regulation at EU level, important lessons are to be learned from recent developments in global financial markets.  This process of review and examination is already under way.  A key issue following recent events in the UK is the effectiveness of deposit protection arrangements across the EU.  The European Commission has recently concluded a review of the Deposit Protection Schemes Directive which sets the framework for national schemes in the EU.  It is necessary to look again at this work and in the light of recent developments to make sure that deposit guarantees strike the right balance between protecting depositors and making sure banks are not encouraged to take inappropriate risks.When a Bill of this nature is proposed in a Department, it often affords a welcome opportunity to address a variety of other reforms which would not merit a separate Bill in their own right but which, nevertheless, are important to the stakeholders affected by the measures in question.  It is that consideration which accounts for the "miscellaneous" part of this Bill.There are nine miscellaneous provisions in the Bill as published and I shall deal briefly with them in the order in which they appear.  Section 9 provides for sanctions similar to those for MiFID which I mentioned earlier, that is, fines of up to €10 million and-or ten years in prison, for conviction on indictment for breaches of the Reinsurance Directive as transposed by S.I. 380 of 2006.  It should be noted that the intention of this provision is to provide the option of a more severe set of penalties for serious breaches of certain provisions in the reinsurance regulations.  Minor offences, as a matter of course, will continue to be dealt with through the administrative sanctions system and-or as summary offences.Section 10 is an amendment of the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995.  This Act provides protection for netting or set-off arrangements between parties to financial contracts in the event of insolvency.  Given the rapid pace of change in financial services, provision now needs to be made to widen the definition of financial contracts in response to market developments.Section 11 deals with the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 to confirm certain limitations of receiver or liquidator access to client money following the winding-up of an authorised investment business firm, and implements an important recommendation in the report of the Morrogh review group published in November 2006.Section 12 provides for a simplification of the State ownership of Icarom plc under administration — formerly the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, ICI.  The main role of Icarom is to run off ICI's pre-1985 liabilities, mainly in respect of its US risks.  The simplification of the legal structures, by removing the holding company Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta, is in the interests of making it easier for Icarom to deal with litigation in the US courts.  Given that the Oireachtas approved the establishment of Sealúchais Árachais Teoranta by way of primary legislation, the Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1985, it is appropriate that its proposed dissolution be approved by the Oireachtas.Section 13 introduces a variety of minor amendments to the Central Bank Act 1942, as follows.  First, there is an extension of the deadline for submission of its annual budget by the Financial Regulator from end-September to end-October of the preceding year.  Given the complexity of the Financial Regulator's budgetary process, an extension of the time period is required.  Second, there is an amendment regarding disclosure of confidential information from the Financial Regulator to the National Consumer Agency.  The purpose of this provision is to put beyond doubt the right of the Financial Regulator to disclose confidential information to the National Consumer Agency for the performance of the agency's functions.  This is subject to any EU confidentiality constraints on the Financial Regulator.  Third, an amendment extends the immunity from costs arising from the discharge of their duties to members of the Financial Services Ombudsman Council.  It will ensure members of the council are not liable for damages arising from the discharge, in good faith, of their statutory duties.  Fourth, an amendment relieves the Financial Services Ombudsman of a requirement to provide the Financial Regulator with certain details where it decides not to investigate or to discontinue an investigation. The Financial Services Ombudsman was established as an independent body in its own right.  The existing provision may give the impression of an element of accountability to the Financial Regulator which was never intended.  This amendment will clarify the Financial Services Ombudsman's independence.  Fifth, in order to ensure continuity of membership and to minimise any potential disruption to the efficient working of the Financial Regulator, the amendment permits the number of required compulsory retirements from the board to be reduced by the number, if any, of voluntary resignations which may have occurred between the relevant anniversary dates.Section 14 makes miscellaneous amendments to the National Treasury Management Agency Acts 1990 and 2000, as follows.  Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) extend the NTMA’s central treasury service, which currently offers competitive deposit and borrowing facilities to local authorities, to new categories of bodies such as non-commercial semi-State bodies, the Courts Service, universities and colleges, the Railway Procurement Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  The extension of the treasury service to the HFA in particular will allow the NTMA to provide the HFA more efficiently with the short-term funds needed to manage its cash-flow requirements.Section 14 also allows the NTMA to engage in swap transactions in regard to its lending activities with local authorities and semi-State bodies through the central treasury service and in lending to the Housing Finance Agency through the Post Office Savings Bank fund.  This will allow the NTMA to offer the fixed-rate loans sought by those bodies while hedging the risk involved for the NTMA through interest rate movements.  The NTMA is already allowed to engage in swaps and other derivative transactions in relation to its debt management activities, and in futures and options transactions, but not swaps, in regard to the Post Office Savings Bank fund.  In line with the NTMA legislation generally, these provisions will apply to the Minister for Finance, who will then delegate the powers to the NTMA.Section 15 is an amendment to provide that the NTMA may use the foreign currency clearing accounts established under section 139 of the Finance Act 1993 for foreign currency transactions other than debt-related transactions, namely, the National Pensions Reserve Fund.Section 16 makes amendments to the provisions dealing with ministerial pensions, as follows.  First, former office holders — Ministers and Ministers of State — on leaving service are entitled to receive severance for up to two years.  Circumstances can arise where, through oversight or otherwise, a former officer holder does not apply for the pension within the specified time period, namely, within six months of severance payments ending.  The amendment would give the Minister for Finance the discretion to backdate the payment of pension in the case of an application made outside the six-month limit to the date of entitlement and reflects a similar provision which applies to Civil Service pensions.  Second, whereas the current ministerial pensions scheme allows for a pension to be payable after two years service as a Minister, the "old" pre-1993 scheme requires three years service.  This amendment would provide for payment of a ministerial pension to a member of the "old" pre-1993 scheme who has more than two years service as a Minister.  This has been the position for members of the "new" scheme since 2001.Section 17 has been brought forward at the request of the credit union movement.  It provides for a practical interpretation of the lending limits which apply to loans where the period on the loan falls below the periods specified in the legislation.  This arises from the implementation of the report of the review group on longer-term lending by credit unions.  This change has already been effected on a provisional basis by way of S.I. 193 of 2007 — the Credit Union Act 1997 (Alteration of Financial Limits) Regulations 2007 — but the Attorney General has advised that the change should be confirmed in primary legislation, hence this provision.The reason the Bill requires early attention is that the imposition of significant penalties for conviction on indictment for breaches under this directive's statutory instrument provisions needs to be in place in advance of the implementation date of the directive on 1 November next across the EU and also to repeal the Stock Exchange Act 1995 with effect from that date.  I must advise the House, however, that I shall bring forward a number of additional measures by way of Committee Stage amendments.  Some of these are merely minor technical administrative provisions but some significant new initiatives are also included, such as the proposal to bring within the sphere of financial regulation the activities of non-deposit-taking lenders.  This will enable the application of the Financial Regulator's consumer protection code to all consumer lending, including what is described as sub-prime lending, which I undertook to ensure earlier this year.  The final details of this proposal are currently the subject of a public consultation exercise until next Friday, 5 October.  Once the public consultation has concluded, I shall move quickly to finalise my proposals in time for Committee Stage.  Details of the public consultation are on my Department's website.As I have outlined, the issues addressed in this Bill largely relate to some important, albeit technical, issues.  The Bill completes the final element of the implementation of the directive, which will yield significant benefits to both Irish investors and Irish-based investment firms as well as addressing a range of outstanding technical reforms to various Acts falling within my remit.  I trust, therefore, that the House will be amenable to a positive and constructive consideration of the Bill's provisions.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19924	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	223	The measures the Minister intends to introduce on Committee Stage are probably of more interest to us than much of what is already contained in the Bill, so I look forward to Committee Stage with interest.There is no doubt we are entering a period of considerable economic uncertainty compared to recent times.  In the past couple of months we have seen what would have been previously unthinkable — a run on a bank where many depositors have money saved, the wipeout of 30% of the value of financial stocks on the Irish Stock Exchange and a credit crunch which is continuing to exercise its grip across Europe.  The economic uncertainties in those markets are compounding difficulties we face domestically.It must be noted that these events have not come out of a clear blue sky.  The warning signs of Ireland's vulnerability have been evident for some considerable period but the Government has chosen to ignore them.  We are well past the time where one could call this credit crunch an early warning or a wake-up call.  We have been aware of this vulnerability for a considerable period and now require a comprehensive strategy for economic renewal to move the economy away from its high reliance on debt finance and the property sector.  This reliance has not only driven very high prices in those sectors but created problems in traditional sectors such as exports, on which a small, open economy depends for its survival.  We must recognise that the economy is entering a challenging period.Ministers will argue that the glass is half full whereas commentators will argue that it is half empty but no one can pretend that the challenges facing the economy are not much more serious than official Government statements admit.  If the economy fails to make a series of significant transitions, the progress made to date will be endangered.For the past two years, the Central Bank has almost been a lone voice in spelling out the financial vulnerabilities which have built up in the economy.  Last year, credit growth increased by 30%, an extraordinary rate, while dependence on debt, which currently stands at two and a half times gross national product, is far in excess of all other countries in the European Union.  These statistics clearly demonstrate a vulnerability.For some time, the Central Bank has been pointing out that the concentration on property as a basis of lending is twice as high among Irish financial institutions as it is among their counterparts in other European states.  In addition, the property market, which is considered to be significantly over-valued and is experiencing the double squeeze of rising interest rates constraining affordability and historically low rental yields, is clearly in a vulnerable position.In recent years, the Central Bank has been relentless in pointing to the widening funding gap in financial institutions.  In 2000, 77% of lending by financial institutions was covered by domestic retail deposits.  This figure has since declined to 54%, far below comparable rates in the rest of Europe.  As a result, Irish banks are particularly dependent on the inter-bank market.  For this reason, when the rates in the inter-bank markets increase far above the ECB rate it is bad news for Irish financial institutions.  It is not surprising, therefore, that their stock values have been hit.We must prepare to tackle the issues.  As the Minister noted, we can console ourselves that sub-prime lending is at very low levels here and the banks, by and large, have been exercising a more prudent approach to stress-testing mortgages than has been the case elsewhere.  While these factors provide a certain cushion against the possible consequences of the credit squeeze, we must await events in the coming months to determine the extent to which this squeeze, which has its origin in commercial paper of questionable value, will bite home.  The Central Bank has provided strong reassurance on this issue but I presume central banks and financial regulators in other countries are providing similar reassurances about their respective financial institutions.  Third quarter results produced by two banks today show considerable exposure which had not been predicted.  As Alan Greenspan colourfully explained, we will only know who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.  It will take time to discover who holds the securities whose values have been severely questioned.Apart from these financial challenges, the economy has economic vulnerabilities with which we must get to grips.  The most recent inflation figures in the HICP, the harmonised index of consumer prices which compares prices across Europe on the same basis, showed that Irish inflation, excluding mortgages, is running at 50% higher than the rate in the rest of the eurozone.  This is a serious indication that Ireland is not only the dearest country in Europe but the gap between the cost structure here and those of other eurozone countries is increasing at an accelerating rate.According to today's third quarter returns, the increase in Government expenditure, at 18%, is three times higher than the rate of tax revenue growth, at 6%.  This difference is a consequence of the Government paying more heed to the needs of the electoral cycle than to those of the economic cycle when it framed its strategy in the most recent budget.In recent years, our competitiveness has been significantly damaged across a wide range of areas, notably in public utilities under the control of Government or subject to Government regulation.  Ireland's loss of export market share for four years in a row is showing up in strains on our balance of international payments.  Productivity growth is at one of its lowest rates in more than 20 years, a reflection of the strength of the economy's dependence on the property sector.  Furthermore, productivity has slumped in trading areas, which are crucial sectors for small open economies.A review of the 2002 to 2006 period of the strategy on climate change, another major challenge coming up the track, shows that it achieved 0% of the Government's target in terms of climate change adjustment, an extraordinary figure.  While the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may not believe climate change will go away, his predecessors believed the chalice would pass them if they kept their heads in the sand.The Government must set out a strategy to tackle financial issues and other, more serious underlying challenges coming down the track.  The first of these is the financial issue.  As the Minister noted, the European Union is examining our deposit protection scheme.  The British Government has signalled its intention to raise the deposit protection cover from €35,000 to €100,000.  In such an eventuality, why would people hold money in Irish accounts if they could enjoy much greater protection by depositing money in accounts in the United Kingdom?  We must underpin confidence in the banking system, offer consumers protection and ensure we do not find ourselves out of line with our nearest neighbour.While I welcome the provisions regulating sub-prime lenders, I wonder whether it is sufficient to apply consumer codes to their operations.  The legislation will introduce suitability tests obliging sub-prime lenders to check the suitability of applicants for loans.  We also need to know about the fitness to trade of those involved in the sub-prime market.  I am not sure the code the Minister is extending to this sector addresses prudential issues and fitness to trade in a manner that provides the necessary reassurance.The Minister did not advert to the need to examine the regulation of the relevant securities or the rating agencies which have been at the heart of how these securities have been valued.  The European Union appears to be holding back on revealing its hand in this area in which conflicts of interest are clearly rampant.  Much of the problem with the sub-prime market is that those who write the business tend to sell it on within six months.  Questions arise as to whether a person who writes business he or she will no longer hold six months later will consider the long-term security of loans.  While I do not propose prohibiting the repackaging and selling on of mortgages, much greater testing of the robustness of those writing the business is necessary.  Selling business within six months of writing it creates the contagion problem because business originating in the United States may be held by a bank in Japan or a pension fund in Ireland.  One does not know where it ends up.  Rather than clog up the whole system, we must go back to the origin and ensure that mis-selling does not occur and proper standards apply.The rating agencies used to be independent bodies providing stock ratings but are now in the business of advising those seeking to have their stock rated on how to get a good rating.  As such, they take a position on two sides of the argument.  Much of the prudential controls operated by the Central Bank and Financial Regulator are based on these ratings.  For example, the Ormond Quay company was given a triple A rating, better than any Irish bank, but its parent company needed to step in with €17 billion when its rating went down.  The Minister is right to extol the strength and broad balance of our banks, but Ormond Quay had its eggs in a narrow range of baskets.  There are question marks over the agencies and how people sell their business.I do not know much about the casual occurrence of many Irish people remortgaging their homes to buy properties in emerging countries.  Who protects consumers where people set up property schemes in local hotels?  It is questionable to give five-year rent guarantees for areas where the average wage is so low that the typical person cannot afford to pay the rent for that long.Other than the sub-prime market, are there sectors in which there is potential misselling?  Perhaps "misselling" is too strong.  Are people walking into commitments with their eyes closed or without enough information and making commitments that have considerable implications for their financial stability and that of the underpinning system?  I do not want to raise hares, but there is a great deal of business taking place in which people commit large sums of money.  Do we need to examine some of these areas to determine whether they need minimum consumer protections of the sort the Minister believes should be extended to the sub-prime market?  The maximum protection in terms of a deposit scheme is 90% or €20,000, whichever is smaller.  The British will move ahead of that, as should we.While the Bill's provisions regarding credit unions are unclear, the Minister is proposing changes to how much the unions can lend.  Greater flexibility has been an issue for some time and talk of deposit protection raises the question of protection in credit unions.  I am sure that, like me, the Minister has received representations from different groups within the credit union movement.  Some stated the current system is robust while others stated it was anything but robust.  The regulator is not happy with the situation and there have been long meetings to determine whether a robust system can be developed.  As a matter of urgency, the Minister must bring those meetings to a conclusion and come up with a system in which we can have confidence.Everyone is reviewing the matter, which we have known to be problematic for some time, and we must move rapidly.  Senator O'Toole is tabling legislation in the other House.  I do not know whether it is the best way forward, but I suspect the Minister is seeking a solution short of legislation to make the savings protection scheme work and to have it and its rules seen to be transparent when intervention occurs.  As much of the scheme is discretionary, people do not know who is protected.  There must be clarity in this regard.  The Minister has raised the issue in his legislation and he must move on it as quickly and calmly as he can.  I hope that before the Bill's completion, he will reassure the House that the situation is being dealt with and the system is robust.Newspapers have questioned the soundness of the Irish regulatory system in respect of Ormond Quay, a German company.  I have been led to believe that the criticism is unfounded, the company was regulated in Germany and the Irish authorities co-operated with German oversight in a proper way.  As some newspapers have made a considerable meal of the matter, the Minister needs to make a clear political statement to the effect that the system is working adequately.According to the Minister's press release after the ECOFIN meeting, the EU believes there is work to be done in respect of the co-ordination between regulatory authorities in different jurisdictions.  Will the Minister advance this work in an Irish context to ensure robust systems for co-operation?  Many companies established here do not have Irish banking licences and, as such, are not regulated here, but they are important to the Irish economy.  If there is any suggestion of their not being properly overseen, the Minister should make a clear statement expressing confidence in the system.  He should reassure people that the system works well, there are proper levels of co-operation and information is properly used and acted on wherever appropriate.The Minister has endorsed the way in which our system, a two-headed body in one institution, overcomes the UK's problem where the regulator, the central bank and the Treasury move in different directions.  The ECB does not intervene directly in markets and depends on central banks responding when it wants to intervene.  It has been successful to date, but the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  While everyone might look smugly at the UK and its apparent difficulties, it is important to ensure at EU level that the links in the euro chain, the central banks, have been stress-tested.  We should not pretend there are no difficulties elsewhere.More needs to be done to show Ireland is dealing with financial threats than the Minister has stated.  The credit crunch has not been resolved at European level and credit here or among our main trading partners could become very tight.  We must respond to this issue rapidly to ensure the credit crunch does not develop into a credit crisis.It is time for a comprehensive strategy of economic renewal like the Culleton strategy of some years ago.  Ministers and others talk about competitiveness, but we must show that we are doing something about it by taking measurable actions in critical sectors.  The Government has not driven the productivity and efficiency agenda in the public sector with the necessary purpose.  We have lost ground in that respect, fudged the issue of reform and delayed in delegating responsibility for outcomes and holding people accountable.  We are behind the eight ball compared to other countries.  We must confront the excessive costs, many of which are generated in Government-regulated sectors.  We cannot continue to pretend this problem will not bite us.Climate change challenges are making the situation worse due to our high reliance on oil for a number of critical utilities, but there are inefficiencies in how we regulate and detect irregularities in the markets.  Ministers must set targets to reduce inflation to EU levels and below in critical areas of domestically generated costs.  We require also a much clearer statement of the investment priorities to be adopted.There is scope in the forthcoming budget to accelerate investment in good, robust projects.  It appears the building industry will have a capacity which was not there previously.  To justify the acceleration, the Minister must agree to the publication of the appraisals of the projects.  People must be properly and publicly accountable for delivery.  It is unacceptable that NDP appraisals continue to be done in secret on the basis of a pretence that they are in some way commercially sensitive.  The data must be published and Ministers and others must stand over projects and ensure they perform in accordance with the appraisals.  The issue must not be fudged as it has been in the past.  The planning model must be reformed.  In cases like that of the school in Balbriggan, we continue to see complete incompetence in departmental planning.  There was a failure of planning to match obvious growth to future need.  Where houses are built, children will follow.  The failure has to be cracked.  We must see measurable action whereby we can establish whether change is taking place.We must see measurable action also in the reskilling of workers.  We know that 30,000 people may lose their jobs in the construction sector.  They will not be easily reabsorbed in manufacturing where the traditional employment outlets are also drying up.  General operative positions are not available.  We must get set clear targets on reskilling and deliver them.We must become early movers in critical areas.  The programme for Government states that we are to cut compliance costs by 25%, but the Government has not measured their current level.  It has not set out the benchmark or starting point which is to be cut by 25%.  The benchmark has to be stated so we can know next year by what percentage costs have been reduced.  What areas is the Government to tackle and how will valuations be conducted to ensure that the reduction is by the intended 25%?  Does 25% in this context mean anything?  It must if it has been included in the programme, in which case we have to see it.  The time for rhetoric on the challenges we face is over.  We need Ministers to sign up to measurable targets in the key areas which are crucial to Ireland's long-term competitiveness.  It could undermine the great success we have had if Ministers fail to square up to their responsibilities.  Most of the challenges we face are not primarily the responsibilities of individual businesses, they are the responsibility of Government to deliver.The Minister says one of the aims of the Bill is to create a more competitive Stock Exchange.  I have been told that we are a long way behind the eight ball in stock exchange efficiency.  If an individual wishes to trade on the stock exchanges in other jurisdictions, he or she may do so directly through trading websites.  The commission may be €10 per trade as opposed to the percentile commissions which apply here.  If the Bill is intended to achieve greater harmonisation of conditions of trade, the Minister should compare the performance of the Irish Stock Exchange in this context with exchanges in other countries.  It is not sufficient to introduce the Bill with a sage nod to suggest we are doing everything the EU asks.  We must set measurable targets to achieve harmonisation and liberalisation in the markets we say we are addressing.  If we do not ensure Government accountability, functioning measures and tangible differences, the Opposition will not be doing its job.I look forward to Committee Stage on which I notice there will be all sorts of debates, including one on ministerial pensions.  The Bill contains quite a rag-bag of provisions.  Given the indication that there will be ministerial amendments on Committee Stage, I anticipate an interesting debate.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	224	This is the first opportunity the House has had to converse with the Minister for Finance on financial matters since the general election.  To paraphrase Yeats, all is changed utterly.  We received word today that the Minister acknowledges now that the deficit by the end of the year will be €1 billion, which is at least €500 million more than he indicated at budget time.  There have also been extraordinary developments with the credit crunch and collapses in banking which have seen people queue to get their money back from banks, a sight not seen in these islands for a long number of decades.The model of regulation adopted by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, which continues to be employed, involves regulation of the financial services industry with a very light hand.  The financial services industry is a very important and valuable employer providing many well-paid jobs, especially for younger people and graduates at the IFSC, and related accounting and legal employment, which are highly attractive.  Like the Minister, I have seen income and other tax revenues generated from people working in financial services.  It is important that the financial services industry, therefore, operates with prudence and consciousness of the importance of reputation.  Historically in financial services, reputation is the guarantee of future expansion and growth.  Therefore, the Minister's silence on the model he has selected of regulation with a very light hand deserves to be questioned.Much as they like to present themselves as masters of the universe, many bankers and stockbrokers have been shown at the end of a long bear market and beginning of a potentially lengthy bull market to be emperors with very little in the way of clothes.  Most people in politics recognise that comprehension of financial products, especially derivatives, is taxing.  To a significant degree, these products are developed and sold internationally from the IFSC.  Other than those who have recently obtained a business degree, accountancy qualification or in some cases a PhD, very few people, certainly in this House, understand much about modern financial transactions and products like derivatives.  In this context, the Bill is timely.  The last couple of months have shown that an Irish economy which is overly reliant on the construction sector may experience a credit crunch which affects financial services and puts at risk some of the employment they have generated.  While the Bill seeks ostensibly to implement European regulations, it represents also a welcome and important opportunity to have a conversation about the direction of our economy and financial services.  I want to raise a number of issues in that regard.  Reference is made in the Bill to the Stock Exchange.  The Minister is aware that more than 50% of the transactions made on the Stock Exchange over the past couple of years have involved contracts for difference, CFDs, a product which was not known in this country before 2002.  In his 2005 budget speech, he announced his intention to bring an amendment which would provide for stamp duty on CFDs.  Surprisingly for someone as politically robust as the Minister, he told the Dáil a couple of months later that he was withdrawing the amendment, which had already been advertised on the Revenue Commissioners' website, following advice he had presumably received from brokers.A number of Irish brokerage firms have made a lot of money from CFDs, although these contracts are now rapidly disappearing as a financial services product.  I am told that certain high net-worth individuals, probably including some of those who are happy to pay no tax, have incurred losses on a personal basis of up to €15 million on CFDs entered into on the Stock Exchange.  The investment sections of major banks have announced in recent weeks that they are no longer advising their private high net-worth individual clients to enter into CFDs because the risk for such products is too high in a falling stock market.  Given that the almost entirely unregulated market in CFDs has been very profitable for certain Irish financial institutions, what in this Bill will make any difference for the future?I listened to a household name, Nick Leeson, being interviewed on RTE yesterday.  Mr. Leeson, who is now living happily in Ireland, is fronting Paddy Power's spread betting.  That is probably a bit of fun but can the Minister tell me the difference between the spread betting advertised yesterday by Mr. Leeson and the CFDs which made up more than 50% of the volume of transactions on the Stock Exchange?  It is neither here nor there if a high net-worth individual loses €15 million, particularly if he or she is one of the many who are tax free thanks to the Minister's kindness.  However, it is a more important issue if financial instability is caused to the extent that ordinary people and businesses are squeezed by the cost of lending and the capacity for raising mortgages.  I am delighted we are having a conversation about where our financial services sector with its ultra-light regulation is going.The Minister will recall that I raised the issue of sub-prime lending on 22 November 2006 and on several other occasions over the past two years both on the floor of this House and in the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  In many poorer housing estates, sub-prime lenders are selling door-to-door and they distribute more advertisements than take away restaurants or pizza delivery companies in their efforts to persuade people to roll up their loans and re-mortgage their houses.  The lenders speak about easy borrowing but make a fortune from the people they pressure into taking such loans.  I asked whether the Minister was concerned about sub-prime lenders preying on vulnerable people and about the regulation of the sub-prime market and he replied that the sub-prime market was not really going to be regulated by the Financial Regulator because it was carefully excluded from his light regulation model and did not come under the terminology defining the authority.  He said, however, that the practice was covered by the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and if I had concerns I should make a complaint.  Given the wreckage of the international financial markets over the past few months, it was very arrogant of him to say that something which appeared so risky to those who were concerned about the prudential element of banking could be simply addressed through the 1995 Act.He also stated:the Financial Regulator has a consumer protection remit in the area of financial services.  It was established as a modern regulatory authority that would perform its function in an independent fashion.However, the Financial Regulator has had nothing to say about what has happened in the sub-prime market, which is estimated to be worth €1 billion in Ireland and, prior to the advent of the recent problems, was expected to grow to around €5 billion within the next few years.  In comparison with the losses in Ormonde Quay and Saschen Bank, €1 billion sounds like small beer but it involves a large number of vulnerable people.  In its two most mature markets, the USA and the UK, sub-prime lending has faced accusations of predatory practices.  Research shows those who access the sub-prime market are more likely to be financially vulnerable and display little financial sophistication, underlining the need to protect them from predatory lenders.  In the UK, practices have included cold-calling and loans have been granted to borrowers who have misled or lied on their application forms about their capacity to borrow.  Has the Minister even made a phone call since the crisis occurred to find out the risks involved in pedalling sub-prime and 100% mortgages or to ask whether applicants may have lied about their repayment capacity?  Even the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, referred recently to the dubious practice of loans being granted to people who are unable to repay them.  With regard to the Bill before us, is the Minister prepared to provide a more robust regulatory framework?  The era of light regulation may not be in the best interest of the banking industry if it allows the sights we have seen of people queueing on the streets to get their money back from Northern Rock.The Irish sub-prime market is dominated by new institutions specialising in the area.  If one ever watches afternoon television or listens to the radio, one will be made constantly aware of advertisements for sub-prime type lending.  Sub-prime loans are being arranged through a network of mortgage brokers, some of whom are very eager to sell products.  There are over 1,800 mortgage intermediaries registered with the Financial Regulator in Ireland.  The market stands at around €1 billion and was expected to grow to around €5 billion.  Credit is becoming more expensive and more difficult to attain and some people may have been misled into borrowing or encouraged to lie in their financial loan applications.  What will happen as interest rates rise and such people feel the squeeze and what does the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, intend to do about it?  He must strike a balance between protecting people from themselves and allowing them a choice.What steps can be taken to make ill-informed borrowers think seriously before jumping into the clutches of a sub-prime lender?  Is the turmoil in the United States sub-prime market contagious?  It will prove contagious if regulation in Ireland is so weak that nobody calls lenders to account when clear risks are taken.  There would, in turn, be an impact on the housing market.  Going back to the Minister's previous comments, as non deposit taking lenders sub-prime lenders do not fall under the remit of the Financial Regulator.  Is the Minister prepared to change this?  Is he prepared to bring sub-prime lenders that, effectively, operate through UK offshoots or offshore under Irish regulation?  This is important and people on all sides of this House with knowledge of financial markets will agree.In terms of financial derivatives there is an issue relating to what brokers have been selling and, in this regard, I have questions on the Financial Regulator.  Some stockbrokers in Ireland have been selling financial derivatives like hot cakes.  Institutions such as credit unions have had lending activities restricted and have taken in a great deal of money due to SSIA savings.  To what extent have such operators been exposed due to investments made in financial derivatives on foot of recommendations made by brokers?  Some Irish brokers have done very well through this trade and I am concerned about credit unions.  Such institutions should be well advised on the investments they make with regard to financial derivative products that may turn out to be risky.The Minister said earlier that those providing these products make money not only on the interest but on the selling fees and once one rolls them up and sells them on one makes more fees.  If one makes €1 billion in financial derivatives the key is to roll them up and sell them on.  Do we know what the picture is like for the people and institutions, such as credit unions, left holding them?The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, would gasp if I said thank God for State banks but, thank God for state banks in Germany.  Where would we be if the state banks in Germany, including the state bank that owned Ormond as it went to the wall, had not rescued the bank that went under as a consequence of the Ormond Quay investment vehicle?  This was a classic example of an operation set up in Ireland to provide a vehicle for investment partly because the German economy is somewhat less buoyant than the economy here.  People in Germany have a tradition of saving and banks are stuffed with money so they must find something to invest in.  We have had a narrow escape.The Bill seeks to raise penalties pertaining to reinsurance and the first bad press the Irish Financial Services Centre got related to Swiss Re and other reinsurance vehicles.  Risks were taken and international parent companies were very unhappy upon examination of the risk profiling involved.  Our financial services industry provides many important, well-paid jobs in this country and it is something we must look after.  However, regulating in such a weak way leaves us open to damage to our reputation and, in the long term, will put the industry at risk.  This is an issue that has attracted almost no discussion.Has the Minister met the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator with regard to what has happened in the markets recently?  On the adjournment last week I raised the need for an enhanced depositors' protection scheme for savers and depositors in Irish financial institutions.  In the case of Northern Rock the British Exchequer and the Bank of England stepped in to cover borrowings.  Our scheme is limited to 90% of deposits with an upper limit of about €20,000 and this is out of line with other schemes operating in the UK and throughout the EU.  Given the closeness of financial markets here and in the UK will the Minister use this Bill to bring forward a revised enhanced depositors' protection scheme?People queued to withdraw their money from Northern Rock in the UK but part of the problem was that the institution is almost exclusively an online bank in Ireland.  There are no real branches here that people can go to and, in the early stages of the crisis, it appears Northern Rock did not have adequate phone lines or e-mail services.  It was very difficult for people to get in touch with the bank.  Has the Minister given any thought to how such a situation can be avoided in future?  He may, correctly, say there is very high liquidity in the Irish banking system but banking is built on confidence, trust and reputation.  Once confidence, trust and reputation start to unravel there can be disproportionate punishment in an unforgiving world banking sector.  With this in mind, has the Minister met the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator?In the debate leading up to the formation of the Financial Services Authority and the establishment of the regulator, the former Minister, Michael McDowell, who was then chairman of the Progressive Democrats Party, advocated in the original report in that regard that financial regulation should be located in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment because it should be heavily consumer based.  The Central Bank and the Department of Finance fought successfully like lions with the Minister's predecessor effectively saying "Push off, financial regulation is the territory of the Department of Finance and of the Central Bank".  As a consequence, the trend in regard to the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulator is for the sector to remain as secretive as the Central Bank has ever been in regard to banking issues, while assuring us that they are looking out continuously for the prudential aspect so there is no run on any commercial bank.  They have said there is no problem but this is the first opportunity we have had to have a conversation with the Minister on economic matters.As an economy, we are facing a year end budget deficit of €1 billion, €500 million more than the Minister forecast on budget day.  The election is over and Fianna Fáil may well smile having got past the election.  It raised spending levels on the current side to 13% but what will it do to meet the challenges it now faces?  Will it just savagely cut frontline services in the way we heard of health service cutbacks, thereby reducing the number of doctors and nurses in Sligo General Hospital and other vital services in places like Waterford and Kilkenny?  Will we witness a strategy of slash and burn economics by Fianna Fáil now that the budget deficit has turned out to be much worse and some of the construction industry bubble has burst?What is the Minister's financial philosophy as we face into this more straitened period?  Will ordinary people bear the burden of the cutbacks in terms of their health, education, local authority services or higher charges as in the case of the banks?  Food outlets drop leaflets in people's front doors advertising take away pizzas and Indian meals and along with those leaflets fall others at an extraordinary rate peddling financial services and loans.  The Minister decided to stand back from regulating that kind of activity.  Will he reconsider his position and have regard for the interest of not only the masters of the universe in the banks who make lots of money on these products but for the impact of such activity down the road on the economy, the financial services sector, but more particularly on people trying to secure a mortgage to buy a house?  With the credit crunch, those house buyers will find mortgage costs much higher in the future because the financial services sector binged and thought it could sell anything to anyone at any price.  Those involved in that sector are laughing all the way to the bank.  I would be very interested to hear the Minister's response.

I welcome in particular the main reason for its introduction which is to give a legislative basis to the fines and potential ten year prison sentence for people found to be in contravention of the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID.  I question the imposition of a fine of €10 million in that regard in this day and age.  While I am aware it is a pan-European figure, when account is taken of the types of bonuses some people in security firms earn per year, €10 million, effectively, would not be a quarter of the bonus earned by the principals in one year.  There is an opportunity in the legislation to review that figure in the future.Deputy Burton stole my thunder, to some extent, in regard to CFDs because CFDs and financial spread betting is the item of the moment as such.  It came to the fore for me on Sunday night when a constituent telephoned and, effectively, said that many people were being ripped off by the stockbrokering firms in Ireland marketing and selling CFDs in particular.Like Deputy Bruton, I also listened to the radio and I heard Nick Leeson, formerly of Barings Bank, promoting paddypowertrader.com, a financial spread betting website.  Being close to a number of punters, physically and otherwise, I decided to check the website.  A pop-up screen on the website stated: "€100 Free — Jump Start your Trading" but the small print below it stated: "Just deposit €250 and place four trades by 14 October and we'll give you an extra €100 absolutely free".I refer to a company called City Index Limited, which I will mention later because it is relevant in another context.  On 23 March 2005 a press release issued from Anna Bradley, director of the Financial Services Authority, stating that the Financial Services Authority has fined City Index Ltd £35,000 for producing misleading financial promotions for spread betting and contracts for differences between certain dates.  It stated that the firm was also fined for various failures in its systems.  It communicated the financial promotions to the general public through daily national newspapers, magazines and on carrier bags used by selected sandwich shops.  The promotional strategy had the potential to attract customers to high risk investments without adequately describing the promotions, the commitment required and the risks involved with spread betting and CFDs.  This is a statement from the Financial Services Authority.  It stated further that spread bets and CFDs are both high risk investment activities as if the position moves against the customer he or she can rapidly incur liabilities far in excess of the initial stake.  It stated also that it is important that the financial promotions disclose that a customer's liability may exceed the customer's initial deposit or margin.Another paragraph in the press release relevant to paddypowertrader.com states:The FSA also found that a financial promotion communicated on carrier bags did not include a fair description of the nature of an investment offered by City Index.  That promotion referred to a "free £25 bet".  The bet was not "free" because of a requirement that a potential customer had first to place an initial spread bet through City Index in order to become entitled to the "free" bet.  The customer could lose all, and potentially much more, of the customer's initial spread bet before becoming entitled to the "free" bet.That is very similar to the situation that arose on paddypowertrader.com.

#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	228	A question arises about whether Paddy Power should be regulated by the Financial Services Regulator.  I can understand that it was a Nick Leeson, tongue in cheek, bet; it was a punt, and it is a Paddy Power type affair, but when one considers that type of affair is being carried out by stockbrokering firms which put themselves forward as being the leaders of society, one wonders about it.City Index was the company that was fined.  I will not name it but there is a major stockbroking firm in Dublin that has become high profile in selling CFDs in the past few years.  When one clicks on this stockbroking firm's CFD and financial spread betting web pages, one reads that City Index Limited, in association with the stockbroking firm, offers various spread bets and CFDs.  Providing everything is kosher, and City Index has paid the fine and served its time, it and everyone can move on.  However, looking further into the particular stockbroking firm I saw an example set out of what would happen in a case of spread betting or buying or trading in CFDs.  The example shows the spread bet on a number of shares would be far more attractive than the money made on a share trade.  Based on the figures used in the example, the return on the initial investment from trading conventional shares is 12.07%.  This can be compared to the return of 121.25% using financial spread trading.  However losses could be magnified in exactly the same way.  I accept this warning is in the small print.A similar calculation is made for CFDs.  It shows that the return on an initial investment from trading conventional shares is 1.1%, which can be compared to a return of 24.1% using the firm's CFDs.  There is no mention in this case of the possibility of increased losses.  There is no example provided of what would happen if the shares go down instead of up, which has been happening over the past four months in the current bear market.  There is a question to be asked with regard to how CFDs are being sold.The constituent who phoned me the other night was very concerned about the vulnerability of private clients.  I use the term private clients, but in England the financial services authority has what it calls intermediate clients.  Intermediate clients are people where there is sufficient evidence to support a classification of intermediate customer.  Such a person can reasonably demonstrate this and there is evidence that the person has appropriate experience and understanding with regard to the requirements set out in a code of practice.  Also, the firms should retain and record the information by which they have come to assess a particular customer as being of intermediate status, the status at which CFDs can be sold to the person.I am particularly concerned about people who fund their own pension, self-employed people who work hard and administer their own pension fund.  We know that to buy an annuity to fund the pension of an ordinary backbencher in the Dáil would cost in excess of €1 million.  Therefore, a fund of €700,000 or €800,000 would probably provide a self-employed proprietary director with a pension of €35,000 to €45,000, which is not excessive in today's terms.  If this person has €300,000 of that fund in equities, we can imagine the target he makes for unscrupulous stockbrokers who see such a margin and profit in CFDs for themselves.There was a very good article by Dominic Coyle in The Irish Times yesterday relating to CFDs.  The article stated a director of the private banking section of a major bank here said its policy “was, and still is, that the risk on these products outweighed the potential return and we never recommended investment in such propositions”.The article continued:That may be so, but CFDs have certainly been big business for stockbrokers and the Irish Stock Exchange.  It is somewhat ironic that one of the most aggressive sellers of CFDs in the Irish market has been [a company, in which the particular bank had a large stake until end-October 2006] . . .If the money of the well-heeled clients of [that private banking sector] and other like-minded wealth managers has not been directed into such highly leveraged products, the question is whose has been.  At the start of the summer, more than €1 billion of Irish investors' funds were resting in CFD contracts.The suspicion is that many of those investing in CFDs should never have been dabbling in such exotic instruments.  Either they themselves did not pay sufficient warning to the stark warnings in the small print or they were not sufficiently vetted.This brings us back to the responsibility of stockbroking firms to classify customers properly so that only those who have the capacity, knowledge, experience and excess funds areinvolved.On self-administered pension schemes, the Revenue has a set of rules which sets out what people can or cannot invest in.  I contacted the Revenue yesterday to find out whether CFDs are acceptable and they are.  Nothing has been put in place yet to stop this.  These things take time.  On the basis of CFDs being allowed, one would expect that the person with a self-administered pension scheme could also invest in paddypowertrader.com and do some spread betting, because there is no difference between the two.  There is a need to examine whether people with self-administered pensions should invest in such high risk financial products and derivatives.  When the Revenue set out what is allowed, the idea was to ensure prudence and that people would not get involved in high risk areas where their fund would be put at risk.Last Sunday in the Sunday Independent, Senator Shane Ross wrote an excellent article on the issue of CFDs.  He called a CFD a “casino for delinquents”.  He said:Irish stockbrokers love stuffing Irish punters into Irish companies.  They often double as brokers to the same companies . . . CFDs are a stockbrokers paradise . . .CFDs have nothing to do with investment.  They are gambling chips.  Borrowed gambling chips at that.  Put very simply, you can borrow up to 90% of the cost of a stock and then bet the lot on it.Brokers encouraged the madness.  They raked in the commission; they charged the punters brokerage — not just on their 10%.Therefore, if somebody put up €10,000 the brokers charged commission on the whole €100,000 at 0.5%.  The investors were therefore charged €500 on their €10,000 to buy in and €500 to sell out.  This is €1,000 commission on one €10,000 trade.  The brokers only went for people who traded actively.  Many people in stockbroking firms made a lot of money which is part of the reason their bonuses are so high.  This system is all wrong.A question must be asked with regard to the use of CFDs by companies in play and open to takeover.  We have seen stocks in the Irish Continental Group being held by Cantor Fitzgerald for certain companies.  This is perfectly kosher.

Prior to the general election both the Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach were vehement in their denials that there would be cutbacks to health services.  However, less than 100 days after their return to Government, frontline health services have deteriorated all over the country and the Government's assurances have been exposed as lies.  I have decided to use Private Members' time to expose the reality of these actions, the harmful impact these decisions are having on patient lives and the effect these decisions are having on the delivery of frontline health care services.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I accept the Chair's correction and will rephrase by saying they have been exposed as misleading statements.The Minister for Health and Children has refused to accept that patient services will be affected by the cutbacks but who can believe her, particularly when one of her own Ministers of State expresses concern?  It is glaringly obvious that patients will be affected by the loss of 30 nurses and four consultants from Sligo General Hospital; the cancellation of dental services for children in Dublin; the dismantling of accident and emergency services in Ennis; the immediate closure of breast cancer services at 13 hospitals nationally without alternative services being available; the closure of a 24 bed unit for the rehabilitation of elderly patients at Merlin Park Hospital, Galway; the disuse of a 17 bed surgical ward in Limerick; the cancellation of essential suicide prevention training courses, known as applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST; the closing of the rehabilitation ward in St. Luke's, Kilkenny; and the deferral of 184 posts in the western HSE, 169 of which are medical, mainly nurses.In setting up the HSE the Minister promised it would deliver efficiencies and value for taxpayers' money but instead she has allowed bureaucracy to spiral out of control.  The Minister's reaction has been to introduce cutbacks and to stop the recruitment of essential health specialists instead of targeting the expensive administrative and bureaucratic overload.  The Minister's spending cuts cannot be described as a drive to efficiency, as stated by the CEO of the HSE, because they are more likely to drive services into the ground.This is more than apparent in Sligo General Hospital where, in recent weeks, drastic cost-cutting measures have been introduced.  Despite Government promises immediately before the general election that there would be no cutbacks at Sligo, management at the hospital has been directed by the HSE to cut upwards of 30 nurses and four consultant posts.  The four consultants to lose their jobs are an orthopaedic surgeon, an obstetrician gynaecologist, a general surgeon with special interest in breast surgery and an ear, nose and throat surgeon.It is inexplicable how the Minister and Professor Drumm believe that patient care will not be affected by these drastic cutbacks, which will see a 25% reduction in overall services and a 50% cut in breast surgery.  It is likely that household staff will also be affected.  Where does this leave women of the north west in need of breast surgery or the 365 adults and 27 children who have been waiting for surgery in Sligo for more than 12 months?  These cutbacks are inexplicable and will undoubtedly affect patient care.  Under the Minister for Health and Children patients are punished for health service over-spending.At the same time, down the road at the Radisson Hotel in Sligo, the HSE conducted interviews for up to 200 middle management posts when these cuts were being announced.  The HSE spent €3.5 million on hotel hire for meeting rooms which, added to the €4.5 million unauthorised overspend on information technology, totals €8 million, a damning indictment of the attitude of management in the HSE.  Information technology and interviews are more important than patient care.Not only are acute services being affected, so are community services.  Schoolchildren in Inchicore and Bluebell were notified that their dentist appointments had been cancelled when a dentist who had just left the Inchicore dental service could not be replaced as a result of the HSE employment freeze.  The Inchicore dental team was given no notice of the ban on employment and as a result cannot recruit a replacement dentist.  If it had been given notice, it could have brought forward the start date of the new dentist so patient care would not have suffered.  Again, balancing the HSE books has been allowed to take priority over patient care, leaving adults and children without essential services and treatment.People are so angered at the recent cutbacks that they have taken to the streets in protest.  On Saturday, Deputies Pat Breen and Joe Carey, together with 5,000 people, took to the streets of Ennis, County Clare in protest at the Minister's cutbacks in Ennis General Hospital.  True to form, the Minister for Health and Children waited until after the general election before rubbishing the promises of local Fianna Fáil TDs.  Now, Ennis General Hospital will not only see the closure of its 24 hour accident and emergency service but the mammography unit, shut down in July, will not be reinstated.  I saw it last week, an empty room full of pristine equipment waiting to be used.This is a dark hour for the health service in Clare and these measures will undoubtedly lead to unnecessary deaths as nearly half of the 100,000 people living in the county live more than an hour away from vital accident and emergency services at the Mid-western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  While the Minister might argue that this move is part of a plan to improve the excellence of services I do not believe her.  Regionalisation and concentration of services may be desirable in some specialties but, as the Minister well knows in the case of maternity and, particularly, accident and emergency services, proximity to emergency care can be critical not just to patient welfare but to actual survival.  What about the golden hour?  People in west of Clare, in places such as Carrickagholt, Kilmihil, Kilkee and Kilrush, are well over an hour from Mid-western Regional Hospital and will not get attention within the golden hour that so influences outcomes for those who are seriously ill.  This emphasises the geographical location of Ennis.In recent months a series of cancer misdiagnoses and unreliable treatment practices have exposed the frightening reality of our cancer services.  Inquiries into practices at Barrington's Hospital in Limerick, along with the review of thousands of mammograms and breast ultrasounds at the Midlands Regional Hospital, Port Laoise, have led to a crisis of confidence in our cancer services.  This crisis of confidence is compounded by the fact that the Department of Health and Children was aware of seven separate issues concerning the quality of breast cancer services at Barrington's Hospital 19 months ago but did nothing about it and allowed these questionable practices to continue until August of this year.People feel isolated by the public health service and, if they can afford it at all, they are turning to private health care in the hope of a better service.  If we have a free hospital service, why do more than 50% of citizens opt to pay for health insurance at considerable cost to themselves?  As we now know, private patients will not always be guaranteed a better or more reliable service.Last week the HSE displayed how little has been achieved in the delivery of cancer services by announcing the supposed details of its national cancer control programme.  This implementation programme contains gaping holes and does not explain how or when the cancer centres will be operational or how much the plan will cost.  In addition, 13 hospitals have been ordered to stop providing care to breast cancer patients immediately at Naas, Tullamore, Mallow, Cavan, Ennis, Nenagh, Loughlinstown, Dundalk, Navan, Roscommon, Portiuncula, Mercy Hospital in Cork and St. Michael's Hospital in Dún Laoghaire.  We know some of these centres ceased service some time ago but when asked at last week's conference which ones, the HSE spokesperson did not know.  Such is the HSE's grasp of the health service.While we all want excellence in the delivery of cancer treatment, how can we seriously believe this is the motivation for those cuts when a letter from the board of Galway University Hospital outlines what the deferral of 184 posts in the region will mean?  It will result in fewer beds being available and therefore more people on trolleys in accident and emergency units, and this will be the position with the winter approaching.  Here is the really damning part: the letter states that deferrals will also result in the need to reduce breast cancer services in Galway from five to three days a week.  This was to be the centre of excellence in the cancer strategy for HSE west.  It is just one week old and already in tatters.The hospital's second CT scanner will now lie idle most of the time because there are insufficient staff to operate it.  Coming into the winter there will be no serology testing for atypical pneumonia, which affects many old people and is much more prevalent in winter time.  It beggars belief that if these cuts go ahead, Galway will not have the facilities to test for atypical pneumonia.Critically ill patients should not be left in a position where treatment services are withdrawn without adequate replacement services being put in place first.  Under the Government's policy it is the patient who is punished and who suffers as a result.Drastic cutbacks are affecting not only cancer patients but stroke patients also.  A 24-bed unit for elderly patients is to close at Merlin Park Regional Hospital in Galway as part of the HSE's ongoing drive to cut costs.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I thank the Deputy.  The beds in the unit were designated specifically for the rehabilitation of stroke patients.  A recent audit conducted by the Irish Heart Foundation exposed how utterly insufficient hospital services are for stroke patients nationally.  Although approximately 10,000 acute stroke patients were admitted to hospital in 2005, the audit found that there are only 12 designated stroke beds in our hospitals nationally.  It also found that only one hospital, representing 3% of relevant Irish hospitals, has a stroke unit, compared to 91% of hospitals in the UK.  Despite the revelation of these appalling statistics the Minister, Deputy Harney, thinks it is acceptable to remove what little dedicated services exist for stroke patients.The HSE now plans to move these patients to other units on the hospital campus where there are vacant beds.  These patients will not now have access to multi-disciplinary rehabilitative care that is stroke specific and more likely to meet their needs.  How does this fit in with a drive for centres of excellence or is this a policy that is only applicable when it leads to savings in the short term but will cost more in the long term both financially and in terms of patient suffering?  Some 350 to 500 deaths a year could be avoided if there was proper investment in stroke care but, yet again, it is the patient who is punished.We are told an orthopaedic unit of 24 beds is also proposed for closure shortly in Galway.  Despite the fact that two orthopaedic surgeons were recently added to the team, making a complement of eight, they will not be able to operate because patients would have nowhere to go after their procedure.  The saying "penny wise and pound foolish" springs to mind.Meanwhile, a surgical ward with 17 beds, which was closed in Limerick Regional Hospital and was due to reopen, remains closed.  The hospital, like others, is unable to recruit extra agency nurses, as an outright ban on recruitment was put in place by the HSE.  Although the HSE in the mid-west claims that there are already enough nurses in the hospital to reopen the ward, complying with such an order is likely to make staffing levels in other areas unsafe.  The result is that patients are punished.The HSE cutbacks have also affected training provided by much needed suicide resource officers.  Such officers regularly organise applied suicide intervention skills training courses around the country to teachers, gardaí, youth workers and other members of the community.  However, they have been instructed that they are no longer allowed to book venues for such courses.  So we can have hotels booked for HSE interviews for middle management, but space cannot be booked to train people in suicide prevention.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The public has been promised by the new Government that it is committed to reducing suicide rates, but it is clear that the Government's commitment to tackle suicide is meaningless.Unfortunately, the examples cited in this motion do not comprise the full list of services to be affected by the Minister's cutbacks.  This list is only the beginning of a raft of measures that will erode patient care and limit services.  In recent days we learnt that Monaghan hospital will be stripped of further services and will have to suffer the removal of yet another ward.  Where are Deputies Smith, Conlon and O'Hanlon now with their pre-election promises?The Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar has to cut medical day cases by 55 procedures a month.  The loss of an operating theatre and six surgical inpatient beds in South Tipperary General Hospital in Clonmel will reduce activity by one third.  The Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore will see the cancellation of elective work.  I have been informed by Deputy Doyle that 320 much needed ambulance staff cannot be employed because of a staff embargo.Since the return of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to Government, the exposure of their deceitful half truths about health services has completely undermined any credibility they might have had.  Patients should not be punished for HSE mismanagement and overspending while massive bonuses are paid to management.  I agree with the Minister that the HSE must manage its finances, but balancing its books should not come at the expense of frontline services and patient care.  With industrial action threatened and patient care bound to suffer, it is high time the Minister took control of the situation.  That is why our parliamentary party requests the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that essential frontline services are not further reduced and that necessary budgetary adjustments are focused on administration and bureaucracy rather than frontline services.  In short, the patient must come first.  There should be more service, transparency and accountability, with less management and administration.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Less than two weeks ago, the Minister for Health and Children came to Cork to open a brand new maternity hospital.  That hospital had been dogged by bad luck since it tried to open originally, and a severe shortage of personnel has caused stress for staff and patients alike.  At the time, the Minister said each hospital would have to operate on a budget as every other organisation does, and the health service is no different.  I contend, however, that the health service certainly is different because it deals with public health matters.The cutbacks and freezes we have seen since the beginning of September will affect patients' lives and will have a detrimental effect on their families.  The freeze on recruitment was implemented without consultation with staff or patients, and the resultant disruption is evident.  We hear talk of potential strikes, staff being upset and pressure on patients.  Most importantly, pressure is being put on existing frontline staff.  When the HSE was established we were told it would lead to efficiencies in our health service with reductions in bureaucracy, but that has not come about.  We have seen more bureaucracy and less frontline staff.When the previous health boards were amalgamated I do not think anybody was told they would lose their job or that they were surplus to requirements, yet people are suffering and are bearing the brunt of the cutbacks.  Frustrating levels of bureaucracy are hampering frontline staff in carrying out their duties.  Today we heard that more than 41,000 people are on waiting lists, yet the Taoiseach's reaction was to state that they should consult the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  While that body has a role to play, it is not the solution to waiting lists comprising more than 40,000 people.  The NTPF is specific for conditions that can be measured such as tonsillitis or hip replacement, but it is not a solution for stroke victims or those requiring long-term coronary care.  The Taoiseach knows that well and the point has been made before in this House.In recent weeks, people have attended my clinics who are directly affected by these cutbacks.  I was told by a man seeking dialysis treatment for his father-in-law that two dialysis units have been closed in Cork University Hospital since 11 September.  Because of these cutbacks the hospital cannot meet the needs of the local population.  I was contacted by a woman today whose child is receiving speech and language therapy.  However, the therapist is going on maternity leave and since there will be no replacement, the services will no longer be available for that child.  A class of 25 speech and language therapists graduated from UCC last June, but 15 of them have not gained employment and they are planning to emigrate to Canada or Australia.  That course was developed specifically to redress the lack of speech and language therapy resources, but we now find there is no place for those graduate therapists.  Patients who require such services are suffering and frontline staff are bearing the brunt of such cutbacks.  According to the 2007 European Health Consumer Index, which was published yesterday, Ireland is ranked 21st of 29 countries for value for money.  In the category of waiting time for treatment, Ireland ranks last.  We can imagine where we will be placed in next year's index following the cutbacks of the past month, with no sign of an end to the reduction in frontline staff.  Management and the HSE, not the staff and patients, are responsible for overspending the budget.  That is where the solution to the problem lies.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I support the Private Members' motion tabled by Deputy James Reilly, principally calling on the Government to "ensure that frontline health services are not reduced and that any budgetary adjustments necessary are focused on administration and bureaucracy rather than essential frontline services".  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Health and Children promised in May 2007 that there would be no cutbacks or otherwise in frontline health services.  How does the Minister reconcile that statement with the HSE's extension of its ban on recruitment for another month, until the end of October?  The ban hurts patient care, has already led to longer waiting times and will lead to more discontent as services worsen over the winter when pressure intensifies on accident and emergency departments.The Minister's cutbacks have had the following results — the loss of 30 nurses and four consultants from Sligo General Hospital, which will seriously affect the quality of care for patients in the west; the dismantling of key services at the mid-western regional hospital in Ennis; and the immediate closure of breast cancer services at 13 hospitals nationally, when no alternative services are available, an issue on which Fine Gael tabled a motion last week.While Sligo General Hospital lost 30 nurses and four consultants, the HSE booked rooms in the Radisson Hotel in Sligo to interview up to 200 candidates for middle management posts.  This is bizarre and the fact that the Minister allowed it to happen shows that she is out of touch with the situation in the health service.  The Government should issue this health warning to the public immediately: "Whatever you do, do not get sick."Fianna Fáil in Government is killing the health service with a lack of acute beds, frontline staff and hospital hygiene.  I call on the Minister to intervene with the HSE and ensure that it lifts its ban on the recruitment and replacement of key medical staff.  The embargo is a shocking decision, which is causing further hardship and inconvenience for patients.  A ban which does not differentiate between a nurse or an administrative officer cannot be justified.I thank all those who work in our health service, often under extreme pressure and difficulty for the great work they do.  These cutbacks make their job worse and are badly affecting staff morale.  Is it any wonder that unions such as IMPACT, the INO and SIPTU have reacted angrily to these cutbacks and are considering work stoppages and public demonstrations which may undermine social partnership?  Does it make sense that staff who treat patients are being penalised for budget overruns which are nothing to do with them?  Does the Minister feel that this ban on recruitment within the health service will have much impact on cost savings?  I do not think it will.The Minister's priority should be to save lives.  I appeal to her to consult the HSE without fail, to deliver new staff as quickly and efficiently as possible to the frontline to deal with new patients.  Political responsibility rests with the Minister and the Government and additional money should be found immediately for the sake of all essential health services and for the sake of staff and all patients.

Many promises were made before the last election, including the Taoiseach's promise that frontline hospital services would not be cut.  I was almost beginning to believe it but this has gone past cynical politics.  Concern is growing about the impact of the staff cuts involving 30 nurses and four consultants in Sligo General Hospital.I congratulate Deputy Devins on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.  He said he was uncomfortable about the job losses and that while the HSE told patients that care would not be affected, the staff told him a different story.  Will the Minister of State tell the Minister how much these staff cuts affect patient care in Sligo hospital?There have been far too many cutbacks in the west.  I have often raised the issue of the reduction of transport for patients to and from hospitals in the Mayo, Galway and Roscommon region.  The old health board seems to still have autonomy and has drastically cut transport for ageing patients.  Will the Minister examine that issue immediately?
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	239	The initiative to recruit 320 new ambulance staff, experienced and inexperienced, trained and untrained, to fill vacancies that have accrued over several years has been put on hold.  This jeopardises an essential frontline service and raises queries about staff morale and health and safety.The ambulance service has taken delivery of 67 new vehicles with another 67 to be provided over the next year or so.  These good plans have been brought to an abrupt halt by a unilateral decision to place an embargo on the health service.  No measure of efficiency or critical need is being brought into play in this decision.  The Minister should review the decision immediately and not just accede to a populist decision to use cuts to make the HSE seem more efficient.The former East Coast Area Health Board, of which I was chairman, was responsible for the eastern region ambulance service which ran efficiently.  The service is about to be nationalised but these cutbacks will damage staff morale and jeopardise the health and safety of the public.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	240	A woman contacted me today out of concern for her husband who is waiting for an operation for cancer.  He is aged 32 and was first diagnosed in 2002.  Unfortunately, the cancer returned last February.  He waited until May for radiation treatment, but this did not shrink the tumours, and he has been waiting since then for surgery with no date given.  That is outlandish and should not happen.An incident concerning the out-of-hours radiography services in Kerry General Hospital came to my attention recently.  Somebody who was seriously injured in a Gaelic game could not have an operation until the following Tuesday due to the lack of radiography cover.At Kerry General Hospital at present, out-of-hours radiography services are available from 5 p.m. to 9 a.m. from Monday to Friday and from 5 p.m. on Friday to 9 a.m. on Monday.  During these periods, one radiographer is available for the provision of an out-of-hours plain film service and one for the CT scanner service.  The person on general call is on duty for a 24-hour period and covers referrals from the accident and emergency department, inpatients, both mobile and ward-bound, direct referrals from the SouthDoc service and any emergency surgical procedures in the operating theatres that require radiographic input.  Given current staffing levels, the hospital cannot provide a radiographic service that will permit prolonged use of X-rays in the operating theatre out of hours.  At present, it is not possible to permit surgical procedures such as intramedullary nailing of long bone fractures or stabilisation of hip fractures out of office hours.Despite numerous requests to provide additional cover, particularly for the radiography service in Tralee, the hospital has been unable to provide this due to a lack of resources.  The number of radiographers employed at present is 14.5 whole-time equivalents, which has remained unchanged since 1996.  Were a second on-call rota to be provided with current staffing levels, the resultant time off would cause an unacceptable reduction in the resources available during normal hours.The hospital will not be in a position to start a second on-call service until the radiography staffing levels have increased to a level similar to those found in similarly-sized hospitals nationwide, that is, with 20 to 22 whole-time equivalents.  It is in the best interests of all to provide a second on-call service as the radiographer is placed in an invidious position whenever theatre cases and orthopaedic cases in particular arise.  Invariably, such cases take a relatively long time to complete, which leaves the rest of the hospital without cover and results in the on-call radiographer being completely overstretched and harassed.This problem is not caused by a lack of willingness on the part of the hospital's serving radiologists but by a simple lack of resources that prevents them from providing the necessary back-up service to cover emergency operative treatment of patients with long bone fractures at Kerry General Hospital at present.I reiterate that weekends in Kerry are busy times for activities such as field sports and obviously injuries will happen.  Such people should not be obliged to wait until Tuesday or Wednesday to have operations performed that could be carried out immediately over the weekend.  The presence of radiography cover could save a person's entire sports career.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I support the Fine Gael motion.  It appears that winter has come early to the mid-west.  First came the chilling announcement of the withdrawal of the Shannon to Heathrow service.  Today, I learned of a recruitment freeze in the airline in question.  More than one month ago, staff throughout the region were informed of the Health Service Executive's, freeze.  Effectively, it has downgraded services at Ennis General Hospital.  This was preceded by the closure of the hospital's mammography unit despite its upgrading.  Members have learned the HSE's freeze will last for another month, which will put at risk key services, will make for tougher working conditions for existing staff and will raise question marks regarding complaints about patient care in the mid-west and nationwide.The problem is that the HSE, much like the Government, is involved in reactionary policies with no obvious long-term planning and on foot of which profit and loss are put before patient care.  As the HSE has a budget of €14 billion, how can it work on a month to month basis?  Although a businessman who sought funding from a bank manager would have a business plan, the HSE has no such plan.  It operates on a month to month basis, which is disgraceful.  How can any organisation work in this fashion?How low can the Government go?  At Ennis General Hospital, services such as palliative care, respiratory care, infection control and cardiac rehabilitation are under threat.  Palliative care concerns those who are about to pass from this life and such individuals, as well as their families, require a nurse to work with them.  As for infection control, the Minister has sought improvements to such services in this House to combat MRSA.  This cannot happen.  In respect of the vital service of cardiac rehabilitation, nurses are being informed by hospital management that they must give up this service to move into hospital wards.  How can the Minister sit idly by and allow this to happen?A report was completed recently by a medic from the University of Leeds on staffing levels at Ennis General Hospital.  He recommended that a total of 26 additional nurses should be deployed at the hospital.  However, only one was appointed and that post has been lost because of the cuts under discussion.  At present, four nurses serve two 26-bed wards at night and patient care is at risk.  I spoke to a nurse today who told me she was obliged to bless herself with holy water before going on duty at night because she was afraid the service would not be there.This action is disgraceful.  Ennis General Hospital is over budget and operates above its bed capacity, which is the reason for its overrun.  At times, it operates at 117%, as its staff do not wish to turn away sick patients and should not be obliged to so do.  A public demonstration took place in Ennis last weekend, at which the people of Clare said, "hands off Ennis General Hospital".  They want nothing more or less than 24-hour consultant-led accident and emergency services at Ennis General Hospital.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The establishment of the HSE marks the latest attempt to introduce national priorities and effectiveness into the delivery of the health services.  One particular aspiration of the new HSE structure was to bring skilled and professional managers into senior positions, thereby ending the near-permanent state of budget crisis that characterised the old health boards.  It is to be regretted that the HSE should be engulfed in a budget crisis of its own making so soon into its corporate life.  As the crisis appeared out of the blue this September, were any delegated administrative and financial controls in place?  Was the entire management hierarchy asleep throughout the summer months?A total of four consultants were informed they were being let go from their posts at Sligo General Hospital.  One week later, the breast surgery and ear, nose and throat consultants were informed they were being given a three-month extension to their contracts.  Such events raise serious concerns regarding the quality of management and professionalism within the HSE.  I understand it is difficult and complex to try to introduce management control and discipline to such a large structure.  Consequently, I will accommodate reluctantly the viewpoint that lessons are being learned.  However, it is unfortunate that this is taking place at the coalface. I hope the aforementioned type of management fiasco will be brought under control.I seek a response from the Minister to some simple questions.  What performance factors are used to determine the annual bonus payment made to the HSE's management?  Is the achievement of the annual financial budget target one such factor?  Will the Minister issue a written directive to the HSE in respect of bonus performance payments this year?The HSE is an extremely large organisation with a massive financial budget.  At present, it has the appearance of a large circus elephant that is behaving badly.  While some questions arise regarding management competence at various levels, another factor is the obstructionist behaviour by various staff representative bodies.  Partnership must be a two-way street to be meaningful and to the ordinary citizen, it appears that significant management decisions on resource allocation and flexibility in work allocations are contested endlessly.  A management that is obliged to battle relentlessly with its own professional staff to achieve any worthwhile changes will be diverted from achieving its primary focus on quality patient services.  There is no national crock of gold to be tapped to keep the money pouring into the health service sector.  At present there is a bizarre combination of additional money being poured into the health services while simultaneously, front-line services are being curtailed and cut back.  I am advised reliably that the mammography services will be withdrawn from Sligo General Hospital by the end of the year.  This comes on top of the loss of 30 nursing posts and four consultant positions.  While front-line positions are being cut, there is not a single reference to administrative and management positions taking any of the pain.  To the citizens, it appears that this PD-FF-Green Government, and specifically the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has lost interest in effectively running the health service and delegated all the functions to Professor Drumm and his team.  As the Minister responsible for health sector reform, she must take firm control.  She has established this arrangement and she must ensure that it delivers real value for all the extra taxpayers' money being spent.  That is not taking place.  She cannot evade responsibility or hide behind subterfuge.  The country will not accept the continuation of this situation and I ask the Minister to deal with it.

On life expectancy, according to the European Health For All database the life expectancy at birth in Ireland has increased steeply since 1999.  In that year the life expectancy at birth was reported to be 76.12 years, while the latest figures for 2005 show it has increased to 79.59 years.  This continuous increase for a six-year period seems to be unique in Europe.  The latest life expectancy figures show that Ireland has closed the gap with the old European Union 15 member states and has life expectancy considerably higher than the new European Union 27 member states average.A recent survey of customer satisfaction was the first large-scale representative survey of customer satisfaction undertaken by the Health Service Executive.  The information from this survey can provide opportunities for learning which will assist the HSE in planning responses in areas which matter to the users of services and the results make interesting reading.Generally speaking, there is strong satisfaction with the health care services by a majority of respondents and a high degree of confidence and trust in health professionals.  Emerging from the results are areas which are positive for health service provision and the HSE.  A majority of respondents were admitted to hospital in a timely manner.  There is relatively little evidence of any GMS/non-GMS divide in experience as reported by respondents.  The level of confidence and trust in the care received in hospital and community settings is rated highly.  There is a public perception of good hygiene in health care settings, although there is an age effect evident, which suggests that younger users of the services are less tolerant of poor hygiene.A majority — 78% of inpatients, 67% of outpatients, 86% of GP patients and 78% of other community service patients — expressed definite or complete trust in the health professional they encountered.  Overall, rating their experience as excellent or of very good quality were 58% of outpatients and 84% of GP patients.According to the OECD, health spending in Ireland grew in real terms by an average of 9.1% per year between 1999 and 2004.  By comparison, the OECD average was 5.2%.  Alongside Norway, Ireland has the highest level of public capital investment in health as a proportion of national income.  At 0.6% of GNP, this is twice or more times the level of most OECD countries.The public voted funding for the Health group, including the Vote for the office of the Minister of Children, is €15 billion for this year, an increase of 11.35% on last year.  Expenditure on the health sector has increased almost fourfold since 1997 to approximately €15 billion for the current year.  All service areas have benefited from this greatly increased funding.In the past six years gross current funding for the health services, excluding the office of the Minister for Children Vote, has increased by over €7 billion to €13.9 billion in the current year.  When account is taken of the increases required to fund items such as general pay increases, benchmarking and other pay awards as well as non-pay inflation and increases in drugs costs, approximately €2.5 billion has been provided for additional investment in services.  The extra investment has provided for significant improvements in our health system across all the main service areas, including acute hospitals, primary care, disability, older people, mental health and child care.Most activities have exceeded the target levels in the HSE service plan.  This does not mean that all such activities have in turn exceeded their budgets.  However, some services have exceeded their budgets.  Therefore, Professor Brendan Drumm, as Accounting Officer, and given his statutory responsibilities to contain spending within the limits voted by Dáil Éireann, has implemented a breakeven plan.  Specifically, the HSE has determined that measures in the breakeven plan should not impact on planned front-line services.I will refer briefly to some of the points raised by Members of the Opposition regarding the acute hospital sector.  I will refer particularly to the hospital in Sligo.  The Health Service Executive has informed the Department that Sligo General Hospital is reducing temporary staff in some nursing, medical and catering posts.  This does not involve any withdrawal of the core services provided by the hospital.  The circumstances are specific to each staff category and I will explain these to the House.On nursing staff, as in previous years, in the summer months additional temporary staff were employed, mainly to cover annual and other leave.  Thirty people were employed on a temporary basis for this reason.  This compares with a total permanent nursing staff of over 700 at Sligo General Hospital in whole-time equivalent terms.On medical staff, four temporary consultant posts, which were contracted for specific temporary purposes and time periods, have recently come to the end of their contracts.  These posts were in addition to the permanent consultant complement of the hospital, which is not affected and remains the same.  In orthopaedics, one of the three permanent consultants was a member of the Medical Council until his recent retirement.  To maintain full orthopaedic services a locum was employed while this consultant was away on Medical Council business.  Following his retirement a new permanent consultant was appointed and has taken up full-time duty in Sligo General Hospital.  Therefore, there was no requirement to maintain the locum position.In obstetrics and gynaecology, one of the three permanent consultants retired in July last, his replacement having taken up duty prior to this.  In order to ensure a smooth transition, the retiring consultant was contracted on a short-term locum basis following his retirement.  This arrangement can now be discontinued and the specialty has its full complement of three permanent staff.On surgery and ENT, a temporary additional consultant was employed in both of these specialties during 2006 to help reduce waiting lists.  They were not intended as permanent appointments.  The hospital has had the benefit of these temporary appointments in reducing waiting lists and seeing more patients.  However, within its overall funding the hospital has to make choices regarding which service pressures most need to be addressed from time to time, and therefore it was decided by the management to discontinue these temporary contracts so that the funds could be used for other service priorities.  For example, the recently opened neonatal intensive care unit, which provides a much better facility for newborns, required and received more nurses to staff it.  However, I am pleased to state, as Deputy Perry outlined, that the consultants in general surgery and ENT will remain in position until the end of the year so that they can complete their necessary work.On overall consultant staff at Sligo General Hospital, additional appointments have been made in paediatrics and radiology.  Further consultants in emergency medicine, pathology and radiology have been approved, and a consultant neurologist will take up his post on 1 January 2008.From what I have outlined, it is clear that these measures do not entail a reduction in the hospital's core services.  Neither will they adversely affect the quality and safety of patient care.  Every effort is being made to ensure the hospital's resources are managed in an efficient and effective manner to protect core services and activity, and to deal with emerging service pressures.This year our health services are seeing significant increases in funding, staffing and patient services.  That is the record so far, and will be the overall outcome at the end of the year.  In this context, the Government is clearly committed to the provision of services at Sligo General Hospital.  The HSE is fully aware that it must remain within the employment ceiling negotiated with the Department of Finance.The strategy for the future of Galway's university hospitals allows for the continuation of the development of University Hospital Galway as the major emergency and complex treatment and tertiary referral centre for the region, while Merlin Park University Hospital will be developed largely as an elective hospital with planned interventions, rehabilitation, dialysis and outpatient clinics.The decision to suspend recruitment temporarily was taken as part of a financial break-even plan developed by the HSE national management team to ensure it remained within its Vote for 2007.  I emphasise the temporary nature of this measure.  As Deputies may be aware, it was reviewed by the HSE national management team yesterday.  Based on this review, the HSE has decided that the financial situation is such that it is necessary and prudent to continue the overall pause in recruitment to the end of October, after which the matter will be reviewed again.  I emphasise the importance of appropriate budget management by the HSE.Since 1997 the level of expenditure on mental health has trebled.  This year approximately €1 billion will be spent on mental health services.  This includes an additional €51 million which was allocated in 2006 and 2007 for the development of mental health services in line with A Vision for Change and for the implementation of Reach Out, the national strategy for action on suicide prevention.This strategy was published in September 2005 and represents Government policy.  The implementation of the strategy is a top priority for me and the Government.  Additional funding of €3.05 million was provided in 2006 and 2007 which brings the total funding available to support suicide prevention initiatives in 2007 to €8 million.  The funding is being used to complete the availability of self-harm services in accident and emergency departments.  Self-harm services are in place in the vast majority of accident and emergency departments whereby in addition to medical care, people presenting with deliberate self-harm also receive a psycho-social assessment following which they are admitted to the treating hospital, to a psychiatric hospital or discharged.  Another initiative is a national positive awareness campaign which will be launched next week.A key component of Reach Out is to develop and implement national training programmes.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention is engaged in a significant level of training including the ASIST, applied suicide intervention skills training, programme and has already trained 91 trainers and delivered over 200 two-day workshops to more than 5,000 people around the country.Concern has been raised about the cancellation of these training courses.  According to information available to me, three training courses have been cancelled with a view to being rescheduled and eight courses have been rescheduled.  The national office is committed to the ongoing delivery of training which has the potential to reach and inform significant numbers of people.In light of the increased information around suicide and self-harm it has been agreed with the National Office for Suicide Prevention that an interim target for a 10% reduction in suicide be achieved by 2010.  In addition, a target has been set of a 5% reduction in repeated self-harm by 2010 and a further 5% by 2016.  Deputies will agree these are ambitious targets but I am optimistic they will be achieved within the allotted timeframe.Between 1997 and 2006, additional revenue and capital funding of €851 million has been invested in health-funded support services for people with disabilities, of which €549 million was provided for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism and €302 million was provided for people with physical or sensory disabilities.  An additional sum of €75 million for revenue purposes was provided for disability services in the 2007 budget.  This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the national disability strategy, which is committed to providing some €900 million capital and revenue funding over the period 2005-09.I am pleased to say dental services for children in Inchicore and Bluebell have not been cancelled.  A vacancy arose for a general dental surgeon and this vacancy will be filled in early November.  Dental services for children in the target groups of second, fourth and sixth classes will continue from that date.An additional €255 million was allocated in budget 2007 towards improving services for older people and palliative care for 2007.  This is in addition to the €150 million package that was put in place in 2006.  In two years the Government had added in excess of €400 million to services for older people.  Almost three quarters of this is being allocated to develop further the community-based services that help older people remain in their homes and for additional residential long-stay places for those who can no longer live in the community.From 1 January 2007 there are no longer three separate rates for subvention.  Persons who apply may receive any amount up to a maximum of €300 per week.  Additional funding of €55 million was provided for this purpose in budget 2007.  In addition to the increased rate of basic subvention, additional funding of €30 million has been made available in 2007 for enhanced subvention.The Government has delivered unprecedented levels of investment in the health service.  In the past six years gross current funding for the health service, excluding the Office of the Minister for Children Vote, has increased by over €7 billion to €13.9 billion in 2007.  When account is taken of the increases required to fund items such as general pay increases, benchmarking and other pay awards, as well as non-pay inflation and increases in drugs, costs of approximately €2.3 billion have been provided for additional investment in services.We must look to developing a system that provides a real incentive for good performance, by the HSE itself and all other service providers so that these major funding increases translate into visibly better services for patients, the most important people in the health service, and all service users across the country.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Like other speakers I welcome the expenditure of €15 billion on health and compliment the Minister on the significant improvements that have been made in the health service, especially during her tenure.  I wish to focus on a number of issues in particular in this regard.One of the issues that has been close to my heart in recent years is services for older people.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children for the past ten years, especially during the tenure of the current Minister, one of the issues I raised continually related to the equalisation of subvention rates across the country.  At one stage the difference between a subvention rate in the west and the east was as much as €500 per week, which was a significant disparity.  The Minister made a commitment to the committee to address this matter and I am pleased to say she did so prior to the end of the previous Government.  Currently an equal rate of €300 applies across the country.  Provision is still available for enhanced subvention and in the east people probably receive a greater enhanced subvention than those in the west.I would urge that the needs of each individual be taken into account in addition to the costs involved.  I accept this is a criterion for enhanced subvention but it is still difficult for people in the west to afford expensive private nursing home care.  That said, the situation has improved significantly.  I also welcome the increase in home care packages, as it is preferable for a person to be looked after in his or her own home.  The provision of funding in this regard by the Government is a big step in the right direction.  I am delighted that 2,000 extra home care packages were provided in 2006.Another issue about which I complained on a number of occasions is that we in the west did not appear to be getting our share of this service.  Again, that situation has improved and I compliment the Minister on her commitment in this regard.Hospital staff is a key issue, especially since the HSE has introduced a ban on recruitment, as is the question of whether services in hospitals have been affected.In my local hospital, Mayo General Hospital, one physiotherapy position is vacant at present and has not been renewed.  I am particularly concerned with this situation, while recognising that the hospital must work within its whole-time equivalent staffing level, which is 1,046 for this year.  Staffing levels were as high as 1,088 at times during the year, which is obviously unsatisfactory and means the hospital must get back into line.  However, I am concerned about frontline services, particularly physiotherapy services, as there is a waiting list of four to five week at present for people requiring acute physiotherapy and up to nine months for people requiring routine physiotherapy.  Given the Minister's statement on this matter, I recognise she is anxious that frontline services will not be affected.  I hope this vacancy is filled as a matter of priority.Moreover, although the matter is currently under review, three radiographers at Mayo General Hospital are on short-term contracts and 14 nurses who have retired or gone on maternity leave have not been replaced.  While the hospital must operate within the complement of staff available to it, it cannot operate without 14 nurses, three radiographers and a physiotherapist without affecting frontline services.  I am particularly concerned about this matter.On cancer services, I welcome the Minister's announcement on the centres of excellence, which is the right way forward.  It is important that we focus on better outcomes for individuals who have cancer.  Unfortunately, it must be recognised that there are no centres of excellence above a line running from Galway to Dublin.  It was stated that a centre of excellence must deal with a population of 500,000, which is supposed to justify four centres of excellence in Dublin, but I do not agree with this strategy.I live in an area for which the centre of excellence will be located in Galway.  I do not have a difficulty with this but I hope that, in the next year or 18 months, it will operate in consultation with the consultants who are currently operating in Mayo General Hospital and dealing with 72 cases per annum, and with Sligo General Hospital.  Breast cancer services is the area which is probably most in the public domain due to the closure of some of the centres.  I do not have a difficulty with such closures because, like the Minister, I would agree that if a hospital is dealing with fewer than 20 cases per annum, it should not be operating in the area of breast cancer.  However, given that Mayo General Hospital is dealing with 72 cases per annum, consultants are travelling to Galway to participate in operating procedures and there is a full multidisciplinary team examining all cancers, it is important we keep an open mind and perhaps develop a network approach.The Minister suggested two years ago at the Joint Committee on Health and Children that we would visit Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York and we did so.  It operates a network service which operates very effectively.  We should keep an open mind when dealing with this issue in the west and north west.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate, particularly in light of the increase in funding of health services which was noted by my colleagues.  Recent OECD statistics suggest that from 1999 to 2004 there was an average increase of approximately 5.2% across the OECD, while Ireland experienced a 9% increase.  Some will of course suggest that we did not spend enough on health for many of the years before 1999, which I am sure is an arguable case.I also welcome the Minister's recent meeting with a group of mayors and Oireachtas Members from County Clare.  Deputy Joe Carey, who attended that meeting, is present in the House.  Whether he will share my sentiments is another question but I am sure we will hear from him at a later stage.The Minister set out clearly at that meeting what has been happening with regard to Ennis Hospital.  She demonstrated that there has been an increase in the staffing budget over five years, with the budget increasing from €14.2 million in 2001 to in excess of €22 million in 2007.  This is extremely welcome and is a vote of confidence in the staff of the hospital and in how it has been managed to ensure it delivers the best possible service to the people of the county.  The Minister recently confirmed €40 million for the capital programme at the hospital, which is welcome.  As that figure of €40 million refers to 2006 figures, I am sure it will be significantly increased by the time the project is completed.It is important the HSE, through the Department, seeks to expedite the delivery of capital projects.  It erodes public confidence when a project is awaited for a long time and is announced on a number of occasions.  By the time it is delivered, public confidence in the facility has been lost and whatever is delivered at that stage is often not accepted.  This continues to lead to the perception that there is a weakness in our overall health service delivery.The type of upgrades which will take place as part of this capital programme, such as the upgrading of the accident and emergency unit, the medical and surgical radiology department, the outpatient department and the day-surgical unit, which will have an increase of 14 beds, are all welcome and demonstrate the massive Government commitment to the delivery of health services to the people of County Clare.  Planning permission for the capital project is due in the coming days.  I appeal to the Minister, through the HSE, to expedite the construction of the project so local people do not continue to believe it will never happen.For far too long, there has been a situation where the biggest cry in County Clare from a medical perspective has been associated with the belief that the hospital will close.  While the Minister has sought to cast aside that notion on every occasion of which I am aware, I am not sure the people accept her assurances.  I accept them, and I know the efforts the Minister is making in this regard.The Minister also referred to the upgrade of the delivery of accident and emergency services at the hospital with the introduction of emergency care physicians to provide around the clock medical cover, the introduction of consultant sessions, the upgrade of the radiology capacity at the hospital and the revenue funding that has been set aside for the CT scanner.  I appeal to the Minister to use what influence she can in trying to ensure a 16-slice CT scanner is provided at the hospital instead of the six-slice scanner referred to in the revenue funding.  Work has been done on reducing the waiting list in this area.The one outstanding issue at the hospital is that of accident and emergency services and the concern for these services in light of the Teamwork report.  I appeal to the Minister to bring forward the publication of that report to as near a date as possible so we can have an informed debate on the delivery of future accident and emergency services at the hospital, taking into account the west Clare peninsula and the fact it is such a distance from Limerick General Hospital.  We need clarity on this issue and I would welcome a debate at a later stage.

I will be very delicate because I do not want to upset any negotiations that might take place but I hope the right job is done.It is important it is understood that even on the Government benches there are serious concerns about the freezing of appointments.  I do not want to appear other than a fan of the HSE.  However, Deputy James Reilly and I were colleagues for a long time on the health board at a time when the board answered questions and provided information to public representatives.  It was not left to us to get memos from other people or to read in the newspapers what is being done.  Many serious issues are being dealt with at present and the HSE should get its act together with regard to keeping public representatives informed.The Health Service Executive indicated recently that Tallaght hospital would not be rewarded with additional consultants because of the performance of its accident and emergency unit.  This policy discriminates against my constituents, the residents of the area.  If there is a problem in the hospital, the HSE should take action against those who run the hospital, to whom I do not wish to be unfair.  While people in Tallaght are satisfied with the Government's efforts to address health issues and the generous funding made available to the health service, they do not want to languish on trolleys in accident and emergency departments.The motion refers to dental services.  I was a member of a group chaired by Deputy Fiona O'Malley, which made recommendations in respect of orthodontic services.  I hope some recognition will be given to the dental service.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I wish to share time with Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin.I thank Deputy Reilly for providing a further opportunity for the House to debate the health service in Private Members' time.  My party leader, Deputy Gilmore, raised the issue of health cutbacks on Leaders' Questions.  The Government's attitude is that cuts to frontline services have nothing to do with it and are a matter for an agency, the HSE, which must live within its budget.  The HSE is not an ordinary publicly-funded body which must live within its budget.  It was established almost three years ago when the Minister took the political decision to centralise public health services under the HSE and, in so doing, depoliticise the delivery of services, an objective which has been achieved.Like Deputy O'Connor, many Deputies have raised in the House problems they have encountered in securing replies to parliamentary questions submitted to the HSE.  As a former member of a health board, I have found it much more difficult to find out what is going on in the health service than I did prior to the establishment of the HSE.It is not good enough for the Government to wash its hands of the problem of health cutbacks by arguing that the HSE has a responsibility to balance its budget.  The HSE is critically important in terms of the delivery of health services, for which the Government has responsibility.  It is difficult to ascertain what is taking place within the HSE.  Why did it fail to spend approximately €100 million of its budget last year?  I understand it returned this money to the Exchequer, yet it has already managed to go almost €200 million over budget this year.  This matter needs to be examined before deciding to cut frontline services.  It is wrong to use such a blunt instrument when, as Deputy Reilly noted, recruitment for middle management positions continues and an overspend has occurred on the information technology budget — we are all familiar with the PPARS overspend.No one knows the reason bonuses were awarded to senior HSE managers.  One would expect that a key target of any organisation would be to stay within its budget.  If that is the case, why would senior management of an organisation which failed to stay within budget be given bonuses?  A series of questions on the delivery of health services must be answered before the Government can stand over a cut in frontline services.  As the political head of the Department of Health and Children, it is incumbent on the Minister to answer these questions.Earlier, my party leader asked why advertisements for the position of chief nursing officer in the Department, which commands a salary of up to €100,000, have been placed in newspapers when frontline services are being cut.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	260	The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Devins, referred to statistics which indicate high levels of satisfaction with health professionals.  I agree that members of the public are satisfied with the high standards of service delivery across the health sector.  However, staff morale is being significantly weakened by the use of the blunt instrument of cutting services across the board.I do not propose to discuss individual examples but we have specific and definite information concerning cuts to frontline services in hospitals in Sligo, Clonmel, Ennis, Tullamore, Galway, Limerick and elsewhere.  In addition, expensive equipment in hospitals will not be used to capacity because overtime will not be provided for staff who could use the equipment in acute cancer services and other areas.  Cutting frontline services and prohibiting the recruitment of additional staff is a crude instrument.The House has not received an answer to a question raised by many Members, including some Government backbench Deputies, as to what will happen to patients in hospitals where cancer services are cut immediately.  No information has been provided on how these patients will be accommodated in the proposed centres of excellence.  I fully support the centres of excellence concept but we need to know what will happen to the patients in question and how they will be treated.  I presume, for example, that a general surgeon who currently performs a certain number of breast cancer interventions in a hospital that is set to lose its cancer service will remain in his or her current post.  In such circumstances, how will the breast cancer service he or she provided continue to be delivered.  From where will the necessary resources come?Deputies Clune and Flynn referred to cuts in paramedic services, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy.  These cuts will badly affect those who rely on these services, many of whom are on waiting lists.  The latest cohort of dieticians, another occupational group in this category, will graduate in the coming weeks.  As the recruitment freeze will still apply, they will have no alternative but to emigrate in search of work because none of them will be employed in the health service here.  Generally, graduates find temporary positions and are eventually appointed to permanent positions.  The recruitment freeze raises a strong possibility of a brain drain of expensively trained health professionals.The "HSE Watch" section on the Labour Party's website features a comment from a physiotherapist who was due to take up a permanent physiotherapy post in Dublin in the next few weeks.  Having given notice, the person faces unemployment due to the recruitment freeze and is seriously considering a career abroad, never to return "to these medieval medical services".  There is a real danger that health professionals will leave the country and possibly not return.In my previous portfolio as the education spokesperson of the Labour Party, one of the issues we discussed was the need to train more physiotherapists, dieticians, occupational therapists and speech therapists.  A degree of success has been achieved in this regard through undergraduate, postgraduate and nursing programmes.  However, if we create circumstances in which these trained professionals see no alternative but to move abroad to work, we will undo some of the good and expensive work invested in building up the professional base in the health service.MS Ireland has stated that physiotherapy, respite care and home help cuts will be inflicted on people with neurological illnesses.  The result will be a reduction in frontline services to the most vulnerable people.According to an RTE report today, there are 41,400 people on waiting lists.  The figure includes 12,000 adults who have been waiting for more than six months and 2,200 children who have been waiting for more than three months.  These figures directly contravene a commitment in the health strategy to ensure that, by the end of 2003, no adult would have to wait longer than six months and no child longer than three months for treatment.  The HSE's strategy of imposing a recruitment freeze, therefore, has a direct effect on Government policy.  The Minister and the Government cannot wash their hands of this issue because it affects Government policy on the reduction of waiting lists.  The Minister may assert that there is no proof that a cut in frontline services leads to increased waiting lists, but any reasonable person would suggest that a reduction, such as closing services at 5 p.m., would have an effect.  It is a policy issue, which is the Minister's responsibility.

We should examine the various layers of management in the HSE despite the original intention to cut down on bureaucracy.  The motion goes deeper.  The adopted strategy, a crude instrument, is not appropriate and is affecting health services.

I want to begin my contribution in support of this motion by congratulating the people of County Clare who turned out in such numbers in Ennis last Saturday in defence of their hospital.  Some 5,000 people took to the streets to oppose the disgraceful decision of the Government and the HSE to axe 24-hour accident and emergency services at Ennis General Hospital.  If such a demonstration had taken place in some quarters of this city, I have no doubt that RTE and some of our so-called quality newspapers would have covered it extensively, but this significant event received scant attention in the national media, thus suiting the agenda of the Taoiseach, the Minister and the HSE, the hospital services centralisation policy of which treats communities in the regions outside Dublin with contempt.It is scandalous that the HSE is imposing a ban on recruitment of staff at hospitals and other health care facilities in a cost-cutting exercise on top of ongoing backlogs and delays in the appointments of frontline staff in our health services.  There is a shortage of health professionals across a range of services and further hardship is being imposed on patients as hospital waiting lists will inevitably lengthen as a result of this decision.During the general election, Fianna Fáil, the senior partner in the coalition, urged people to support it to take "the next steps".  It seems the next steps are health care cuts in the public system while the Government carries on with its disgraceful plan to reward the private for-profit health system with public land and tax breaks under the notorious co-location scheme.  The HSE has cited an alleged overspend of €140 million by hospitals to justify these cuts, but the HSE announced last July its final abandonment of the failed PPARS computer system, which cost €130 million by 2005.  The Government and the HSE are jointly responsible for failed policy and gross mismanagement, leading to poorer care for patients.The disadvantaged parts of the health service will be worst hit by the recruitment freeze.  Earlier this year, the HSE announced 60 new consultancy posts for hospitals throughout the State, but none of them was allocated to the north-east region comprising Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath.  The current HSE cuts serve to compound that gross injustice.The health service unions are fully justified in contemplating protest action.  The false claims by the Minister and HSE chief executive Brendan Drumm that the cuts will not affect patient care are being fully exposed with hospitals having to curtail services.  The Taoiseach has remained silent on these cuts while both he and the Minister have attempted to hide behind the HSE, but they cannot shirk their responsibility for these unnecessary cuts.  Despite the vibrant economy of the past decade and a HSE that the Minister claims has streamlined the running of the health services, the Government is still presiding over fundamentally flawed policies and gross mismanagement, leading to poorer health outcomes for public patients.  I emphasise that they are public patients.The health service unions deserve public support in their efforts to resist these cuts.  It is right for the motion to refer to the dismantling of key services at Ennis.  As a Cavan-Monaghan representative, I know all too well the devastating effect of the axing of vital accident and emergency services.  Lives will be lost.  Further pressure will be put on neighbouring accident and emergency departments that must cope with the additional patients who would normally have had access to the closed units.  These are the facts.Currently, some 15% of the population are more than one hour travelling time from an accident and emergency unit.  If the notorious Hanly report is fully implemented, that percentage will rise to 30%.  Nearly one third of the population will be more than an hour from accident and emergency units with the inevitable result of lives lost.  Despite this, the Government and HSE centralisation drive goes on without the fully equipped and fully resourced ambulance and paramedic services being put in place as promised.In August, a survey published in Britain confirmed the link between distance travelled by ambulance to hospital emergency departments and the risk of death.  The survey published in the Journal of Emergency Medicine confirmed that increased distance from the departments is associated with an increased risk of death.  The Government must heed this warning from the neighbouring island, which adds to the voices of communities throughout the State which feel threatened with the loss of accident and emergency units.The findings of the survey may seem obvious and it is all too tragically so for the communities served by Monaghan General Hospital, which have seen deaths as a result of the longer journey times imposed by the cutting of services at our hospital.  However, this is an important study because it was carried out in the context of the British Government's proposals to close accident and emergency units in smaller hospitals.  I hope this issue will be revisited.The policy pursued by the Minister and the HSE to dangerously over-centralise all acute emergency care services has been repeatedly rejected by the people.  The Minister should not cite the recent general election results as an indication of approval for her reappointment or the configuration of the Government, as nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government must scrap its policy and ensure that existing emergency services, including hospital emergency units and ambulance services, are enhanced and developed.  Closed or curtailed emergency units, such as those at Monaghan, must be fully restored.  The threat to Ennis and other hospitals must be lifted.  It is time for the Minister and others with responsibility to realise that nothing less is acceptable.Debated adjourned.

If I had known that, I probably would have withdrawn the matter and resubmitted it at a later date.I wish to raise the issue of the replacement of staffing funding for community child care services with the proposed community child care subvention.  The change will have serious consequences, especially for rural child care facilities.  Currently, 21 community groups provide sessional, full-day and equal opportunity school-age child care in County Limerick.  A further 11 groups have recently received funding under the equal opportunities child care scheme and national child care investment programme or are in the process of applying for such funding.  The County Limerick community child care forum feels the introduction of the new scheme will result in inadequate child care provision and that children from disadvantaged backgrounds will be segregated from their peers.  It is also felt that the introduction of bands A, B and C, as proposed, will lead to classification of parents, thereby reinforcing the social class stigma.  Further, the scheme will reduce the level of funding available to community child care services which are already experiencing shortfalls.Under the community child care subvention scheme, children whose parents are in receipt of social welfare benefit will be subvented to attend community care services.  The process will require parents to complete a form outlining PPS and social welfare details which will be available to those of their peers and neighbours who are organising a local scheme.  The form will be submitted to child care services and the office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and the Department of Social and Family Affairs who will determine if a child is eligible for subvention.  According to the type of social welfare being received, a parent is labelled "A", "B"  or "C".  Subvention is made in respect of categories A and B but not C.The proposed scheme raises many serious issues.  It is calculated on foot of case studies in the mid-west that many child care facilities will be put out of commission.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, is present as I have written to him on the matter previously, as, I am sure, have many other Deputies.  The Minister of State must address the changes he is making to the circumstances of low income parents who are dependent on community child care facilities to facilitate their access to work.  It is these parents who have raised their concerns with me and told me how they have benefited enormously for the last six or seven years from the availability of valuable community child care centres.  The centres are community-based, accessible and low cost and they facilitate those who otherwise would be unable to enter employment.  These parents will be squeezed out by the changes the Minister of State proposes to implement from next January.  They will be unable to avail of prohibitively expensive private child care and their only option, as some have suggested to me, will be to become welfare dependent once more.  Many of them do very valuable work in the community.Child care facilities were intended originally to allow people to return to education and work and the proposed changes represent a backward step.  The Minister of State mentioned in his letter family income support, but such support cannot meet the cost of child care.  I ask the Minister of State to address the circumstances of parents on low incomes who will be severely affected by the proposed changes.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I submitted the matter for consideration last week on foot of a heavily attended public meeting in my constituency at the Woodlands House Hotel in Adare.  The meeting on the introduction of the new child care subvention scheme was attended by 250 to 300 child care providers operating within the community child care service as well as by parents.  The groups in question are grateful to the Government and its predecessor for the capital funding which has been made available to build very fine community-based crèche facilities.  A number of crèches in my constituency have received very significant funding, including €1.2 million for St. Coleman's community crèche in Kilcoleman, €1.4 million for Broadford community crèche in Broadford, Charleville, and €1.7 million for Rathkeale community crèche.  A further crèche is under construction in Banogue, County Limerick, with a capital grant of €525,000.  The funding is very significant.  Operators, children and parents benefit from the grants as no capital or mortgage repayments are factored into child care costs.Interested parties are saying that the subvention scheme has not been the subject of proper consultation and will create an urban-rural divide and that the existing system works against integration.  The proposed scheme will compromise job security and lead to high staff turnover with a resultant lack of continuity of care.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I thank the Deputies for raising this important matter.The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their child care costs are child benefit and the early child care supplement.  The latter payment recognises the higher child care costs of pre-school children, is the responsibility of my office and alone amounts to expenditure of over €400 million in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents regardless of income, labour market status or the type of child care they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government child care policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports at disadvantaged families.  It is in this context that the equal opportunities child care programme was established some years ago with targeted support provided through the staffing support grant scheme.Community-based, not-for-profit child care providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate with reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under the scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  The funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007 where it was considered necessary to enable services to remain accessible to disadvantaged parents.  Continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.Under the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-10, the successor programme to the EOCP, a new scheme to support community child care services with a focus on disadvantage will be introduced on 1 January 2008 and will continue to complement the universal supports in place for all parents.  The community child care subvention scheme has been allocated €153 million for the next three years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme.  Under the new scheme, services will be grant aided according to the service they provide and the profile of the benefitting parents.  In turn, the subvention received by the services will be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.I am sure the Deputies will agree that the provision of additional targeted support for disadvantaged families is a necessary component of any equitable system for supporting families with the cost of child care.  Any such targeted approach must have a cut off point and it was considered that the income limits for family income supplement were the most appropriate given the scale of the scheme and its focus.  Deputies may be aware that the current FIS limit for a family with three children under 18 stands at €625 per week, while the minimum wage currently stands at €8.65 per hour.  As of March 2007, the average industrial wage amounted to €615 per week.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community child care services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the value for money review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported.  The ceiling for funding which existed under the previous scheme is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all operational costs of services rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which are in some cases inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents will be available at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current level until July 2008.  My office is currently engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services.  A meeting with representatives of the city and county child care committees has already taken place.I do not think any purpose would be served by suspending the introduction of the scheme.  The more detailed and comprehensive data which will be generated by the new scheme between now and the end of December will be analysed by officials in my office, as was announced last July.  If appropriate, any adjustments necessary to secure the best outcomes for child care services and for disadvantaged parents and their children will be considered by the Government in early 2008 and well in advance of the commencement of the new funding levels in July 2008.  In the meantime, groups can continue to receive funding at their current rate up to the end of June 2008.  To qualify for the continued funding, groups are required to submit the information required for the assessment of the impact of the new scheme by early November 2007 and I would appeal to them to do so.  It is important to emphasise that there will be no changes between now and July 2008.It is worth repeating this Government has built a formal child care structure virtually from scratch.  Since 2000, we have created over 35,000 new child care places in the community and private sector and supported over 26,000 more.  Under the EOCP, €500 million has been allocated from 2000-06, accounting for over 3,300 grants to a mixture of community and private providers.  The successor programme, the national child care investment programme, of which the child care subvention scheme is a part, has been allocated €575 million over the next three years and is on target to create 50,000 additional child care places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for three to four year-olds and school age child care.  In real terms, this Government will have spent over €1 billion of public money on the child care sector by 2010.  Given that the new subvention scheme actually increases funding by 16% over the EOCP staffing scheme, I refute in the strongest possible terms the claim that the Government has suspended such support.  Nothing could be further from the truth and, as I have noted, any adjustments which might be considered necessary will be considered by the Government once the relevant data has been analysed.

Yesterday I attended the launch of the mid-term review of the positive ageing cross-Border project in my home town of Monaghan.  The project is the result of a strategic partnership between two of the largest older people's organisations in Ireland, Age Action Ireland and Age Concern Northern Ireland.  It is an excellent example of what can be done on the ground to bring people together across the Border and to facilitate them collectively to enhance their lives as individuals and members of the community.  The report of the positive ageing cross-Border project states that older people living in the Border counties, North and South, have failed to benefit from the peace dividend.  Many are living in isolated areas with poor public transport and dwindling services.  The report is based on consultation since January of this year with older people's groups from the nine counties straddling the Border.Positive ageing cross-Border programme development manager, Barry O'Keeffe, has stated that although many of these people have remained in their Border region community throughout the worst of times and have solidly contributed to the life of their communities, now as we look to a new peaceful future on this island, older people in the region seem to have lost out on the peace dividend.  Both Age Action Ireland and Age Concern Northern Ireland call on politicians on both sides of the Border to come together in collaborative cross-Border co-operation to seek solutions to these issues.The first and most critical issue cited by Age Action and Age Concern is the pressing need for rural public transport.  They have urged all political parties to unite and respond by expanding existing rural public transport services and taking a more integrated approach to rural and cross-Border transport issues.Age Concern Northern Ireland director of community services, Alan Herron, said rural communities were witnessing a decline in rural living marked by the withdrawal of key services including post offices, banks, pharmacies, shops and transport services.  He added that the social consequences of failing to significantly address these issues in rural Border regions will be grave.Cross-Border forums attended by older people were organised in Monaghan, Newry, Omagh, Letterkenny and Carrick-on-Shannon.  At those forums the project found that poor transport and road infrastructure in the region exacerbated rural isolation and rural depopulation.Everyone has rightly welcomed the recent introduction of the all-Ireland free travel pass.  That is something we in Sinn Féin, in common with older people's groups, have advocated for many years.  However, many older people in rural areas still have no way of accessing free travel in practise because the public transport infrastructure is simply not there.  Only today an issue was brought to my attention concerning a pensioner in my constituency who has had to repeatedly cancel medical appointments because he does not have his own transport and cannot avail of an appropriate public service.  Similar issues which present from time to time reflect the reality on the ground.  We do not have the necessary public transport infrastructure to meet people's needs.Over-centralisation of transport infrastructure in Dublin and Belfast has had a negative impact on rural peripheral and isolated Border regions.  People in rural Border areas suffer a double disadvantage as both their rural location and the division of services by the Border isolates them further.  Many older people are faced with declining local public and private services and weakened community and family supports.  For these reasons I urge the Minister for Transport and the Marine to initiate an effective public transport system for rural communities, especially so that older people can fully avail of free travel passes to help access essential services and to make possible more active and healthier lifestyles.  The Minister also needs to co-ordinate this enhanced rural public transport system with his counterpart in the Executive in the Six Counties.I want to echo the motto of the positive ageing cross-Border project which states, "Age has no borders". This is surely a reminder that, irrespective of our age or where we live, we are all ageing and must all be concerned with these issues regardless of man-made frontiers and generation gaps.  I hope the Minister of State will have some good news for those who are listening.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising this important issue, to which I will respond on behalf of the Minister for Transport and the Marine, Deputy Dempsey, due to his unavoidable absence.  The programme for Government restates the commitment to rural transport that underpins the Department of Transport and the Marine's rural transport programme, RTP, which was launched last February.  The new programme, which is administered by Pobal, is building on the success of the former rural transport initiative 2000-06 by putting that pilot initiative on a permanent mainstreamed basis with significantly increased funding provided under the programme for community transport groups to address social exclusion in their rural areas arising from unmet public transport needs.The RTP is currently operational in all counties with the exception of County Louth, from which there was no application under the pilot rural transport initiative, and 34 community transport groups are currently funded under the programme.  Some 93,000 transport services operated in 2006 and over 790,000 passenger trips were recorded on these services.  The bottom-up approach developed during the pilot rural transport initiative demonstrated the effectiveness of the community and voluntary initiative and involvement in the provision of rural transport services.  The RTP is building on that concept and the main drivers of community rural transport continue to be the local communities themselves.  The Government's role is that of facilitator, helping local communities to address their transport needs through financial and administrative support while communities themselves take the lead in developing transport services to fulfil these needs.The Government's continued commitment to the RTP is reflected in the inclusion in Towards 2016 of phased increases in the annual RTP allocation to about €18 million.  The National Development Plan 2007-13 commits some €90 million to the RTP over its full term.  The €9 million being provided for the RTP in 2007 is envisaged as leading to an increase in the frequency of existing services, extended coverage, and additional groups of customers accessing rural transport.   In making specific allocations to the individual rural transport programme, RTP, groups from this funding, the Minister for Transport and the Marine has asked Pobal to work closely with the groups to maximise the impact of the funding as well as ensure continued value for money.In addition to funding from the Department of Transport and the Marine, RTP groups also benefit each year from funding provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs arising from the application of the free travel scheme to the initiative.  Some RTP groups also benefit from local development funding by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Most also generate additional funds from their own sources.Pobal is now engaged in a process to extend the RTP on a phased basis with a goal of achieving nationwide coverage in due course.  Initially this has involved consideration of the best structural arrangements to manage the RTP at local level into the future.  In the short to medium term the primary focus is on building capacity within the programme to expand rural transport services by way of better services and wider coverage.  Specific attention is being given to rural areas that do not currently have access to public transport.Among other things, the mainstreaming of rural transport provision may present opportunities to enhance community-based cross-Border rural transport services, as Deputy Ó Caoláin said.  With that in mind, the Department of Transport and the Marine and the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland are jointly supporting a research study into community-based transport services to local cross-Border communities. A European Union INTERREG IIIA programme grant will provide the major part of the funding for the study.  This matter was discussed at the third meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, in the transport sector on 14 September 2007.  The council welcomed the research study that is under way and agreed to consider the report and its recommendations at a forthcoming meeting of the NSMC in the transport sector.I assure the House on behalf of the Minister for Transport and the Marine that the Department of Transport and the Marine, in conjunction with Pobal, will progress the development of the RTP on a nationwide basis as soon as possible.  In doing so, the Department will pay particular attention to the unique circumstances of cross-Border communities.

Given the time allotted, I must be succinct and so will offer a set of suggestions.  We must establish how many people have died and how many have been injured.  We must follow up BBC reports and find out the whereabouts of 4,000 monks who were arrested in Rangoon, removed to two places of detention, disrobed and manacled.  It is reported that they are likely to be removed to northern parts of Burma.We need to move beyond the mantra of the EU and its governments that amounted to a belief in constructive engagement.  This meant one could continue to engage with the junta that was practising widespread abuses of human rights while imagining that gradual progress was possible.  This policy has not worked, nor have sanctions been imposed by the EU because it is clear that the benefits derived by India, China, Thailand and others involved in the rape of Burma's resources undo any possible effects of such measures.Up to 800,000 people in Burma may have endured forced labour at some point and there are also issues relating to the forced relocation of people.  Ethnic minorities endure appalling treatment and the country has put up its shutters to the rest of the world.  In 1988 3,000 people were massacred and most human rights organisations suggested the situation deteriorated again in 1996. Burma behind the Mask, edited by Jan Donkers and Minka Nijhuis, published in 1996, may be the best account, from within, of what took place.The international community has been silent on Burma and this has been compounded by economic benefits derived by its neighbours.  This cannot continue.  Facilitating the junta at the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, meeting was a miscalculation, though it may have been made for the best of reasons by those who believed in constructive dialogue.  The anticipated results have not occurred and I therefore believe that an international group should now be established to visit Burma.  The EU should seek permission for a group to visit Burma to establish how many people have died, how many have been injured, how many of the 4,000 monks arrested in Rangoon have been relocated, the details of people who have endured forced labour and the position of the various ethnic and indigenous groups there.  The worst that can happen is permission will be refused and that at least means the issue will stay alive.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	272	We all condemn the appalling scenes we have witnessed in recent days of the use of force by the military junta in Burma-Myanmar in suppressing pro-democracy protests.  The brutal regime has terrorised 50 million citizens of Burma for 45 years and a similar popular peaceful protest 20 years ago saw some 3,000 people executed.  Nobody knows the true number of deaths in Burma in recent days but Associated Press figures suggest 200 people have been killed and up to 2,000 detained.  Thousands of monks have been removed from monasteries and are being detained in areas away from the public arena.The people of Burma are terrified and this is particularly evident now that the revered monks cannot protest on the streets.  The response of the international community has been lethargic and reflects double standards as little more than condemnation and hand-wringing has been forthcoming from major countries in the East and West so far.  For example, when strategic geographical and resource interests were involved in the Middle East, the United States was quick to raise the ante and intervene economically, with sanctions, and militarily.Ireland gave the freedom of its capital city to the pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and should be to the fore in demanding urgent action by the EU and world community.  We cannot simply condemn yet stand idly by.  The United Nations special envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, was given the run around in recent days as the junta in Burma clearly kept him away from trouble spots and proved unwilling to meet him until a semblance of normality had been restored.  The meeting today, a peremptory 15 minutes, was a sham and the hope for dialogue between General Than Shwe and the pro-democracy movement was totally dashed.The least we can expect from the international community is sustained pressure on China not to veto any UN resolution on this matter.  As Deputy Michael D. Higgins said, the EU should promote a special group to visit Burma and inspect conditions.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank Deputies Higgins and Costello for raising this issue.  On behalf of the Government, I welcome this opportunity to comment on the recent events in Burma.The Government remains gravely concerned at the appalling situation in Burma.  The people of Burma have made clear their demands for democracy, national reconciliation and an end to military dictatorship and the Irish Government and people stand firmly behind them.  The regime has tried to quell the voices of the monks, nuns and unarmed civilians, peacefully demonstrating on the streets, through bullets, beatings, gassings, widespread arrests and brutal repression.  We do not yet know the numbers killed, injured, arrested or missing, and we may never know them precisely.  The regime has worked to cut off communications with the outside world in the hope of covering up what it has been doing, but it has not been able to hide the evidence of its brutal regime, nor the strength of discontent and opposition to its rule among the people of Burma.The Irish Government has long taken a strong position on the situation in Burma.  We have spoken out firmly on the issue for many years at the UN General Assembly and in all other appropriate fora.  We consistently raise our concerns in meetings with ASEAN and other Asian countries.  In international meetings where our Ministers and officials have encountered Burmese Ministers or delegations, we have used the opportunity to make clear, in a forthright manner, the views of the Government and people of Ireland.Through our Irish Aid programme, we have provided some support for humanitarian causes and for the democratic process.  We maintain close links with Burma Action Ireland and the small Burmese community in Ireland, and we provide some support for their activities.  We have worked proactively to ensure that Burma remains high among the priorities of the EU and the UN and have supported discussions at the Human Rights Council, at the UN General Assembly and the Security Council.In recent weeks, the Government has stepped up its action in support of the Burmese people.  In the early days of the popular demonstrations, on 24 August, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, made a statement calling for the release of key democracy activists, and for the initiation of inclusive dialogue with opposition parties.  As the situation intensified, he followed up with a statement on 24 September in support of the demonstrators, and appealed to the regime to exercise restraint, to release all political detainees and to initiate a process of dialogue and national reconciliation.  Immediately following the widespread attacks on the unarmed demonstrators on 26 September, he forcefully condemned the use of force and called again for restraint, dialogue and reconciliation.The Minister also called on ASEAN and other Asian countries, which may exercise influence on the Burmese regime, to do all in their power to protect the people of Burma, to encourage restraint, dialogue and reconciliation and to support the role of the UN and, in particular, an immediate visit to the country by the UN Secretary General's special envoy, Dr. Ibrahim Gambari.  He followed up these statements by writing to the Foreign Ministers of China and India, calling for them to use their influence to stop the violence in Burma and encourage positive change.  These messages were delivered to the ambassadors of China and India in Dublin and by our ambassadors in Beijing and New Delhi.At the request of the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, our ambassadors in the ASEAN region have made urgent démarches to the Governments of Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.  Our ambassadors at the UN in New York and Geneva remain active in conveying these messages to Security Council members, ASEAN and Asian neighbours of Burma.  We are pleased that these representations have received encouraging responses.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in his address today to the UN General Assembly in New York, will again highlight our concerns.  He is taking every opportunity while at the General Assembly and in Washington to discuss the situation in Burma with the UN Secretary General, the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, and other leaders.The situation in Burma is truly deplorable, but we believe that the events of the past few weeks represent a possible turning point.  For the first time, ASEAN, as an organisation, has spoken out in condemnation of the brutality of the Burmese regime, expressing its "revulsion" at the violence used against unarmed demonstrators and calling for national dialogue and reconciliation.  Similarly, the Government of China — which maintains very close links with the Burmese regime — is working behind the scenes with the military leaders and has spoken out more clearly than ever before in calling not only for calm and stability, but also for reconciliation and democracy.The significance of these statements and actions of Burma's regional neighbours cannot be underestimated.  The immediate effect of the pressure brought to bear on Burma by China and ASEAN countries was the agreement of the regime to grant a visa to UN special envoy, Dr. Gambari, and its agreement to allow him to meet democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.  He met today with the junta leader, General Than Shwe, and will meet Ms Suu Kyi again tomorrow, before returning to New York on Thursday, where he is scheduled to brief the Security Council.  The Secretary General has advised the Minister, Deputy Ahern, that Dr. Gambari will return to Burma next month.At the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland actively supported the EU's call for a special session on Burma, which took place today, and delivered a strong national statement.  We very much welcome the strong resolution adopted by consensus at the Council today — including, significantly, by Burma's regional neighbours.  Among other provisions, the resolution deplores the regime's violent repression of peaceful protestors, calls for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Burma to be fully respected and demands international access to the country to investigate the situation.  We believe this sends the clearest of signals to the Burmese regime that the international community is prepared to stand together to ensure that the days of impunity are over.  Ireland and our EU partners apply a range of sanctions and restrictive measures to Burma.  Options for an extension of sanctions are under urgent consideration.  It is expected that EU Ministers will consider this question at the next General Affairs Council on 15 October.  A priority for us is to ensure that any new measures are targeted against the regime and do not cause further suffering to the people of Burma.The Government continues to stand firm with the people of Burma at this time as, I know, do the people of Ireland.  We will continue to monitor developments in Burma very closely and to work unrelentingly with EU, the UN and the countries of Asia and to keep the focus of the world on the plight of the people of Burma.

That came as a great shock to the parents, school staff and community of Kinvara.  We have waited practically 12 months for a solid commitment from the Department of Education and Science and the Minister to provide for the continuation of second level education in Kinvara.I welcome the decision by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, on 16 May, prior to the general election, to commit herself and the Government to the provision of second level education in Kinvara.  I also welcome the decision of the trustees, the Sisters of Mercy, in response the Minister's decision, to grant a concession that they would allow an intake of first year students in September of this year.  Despite the fact that this concession was granted as late as the first week in July, it is important to recognise that the parents of the area have confidence in the school, evidenced by the intake of first year students for this year.Enrolments in national schools, as of today, in the catchment area of Kinvara are as high as 800.  As recently as May of this year, the level of enrolments in the area was assessed, based on CSO figures, by the Department as being 779, but the level of enrolments has been even higher.The population of the area has increased 7% year-on-year for the past five years and is likely to increase further in the coming years.  The need for education provision in the area exists, a fact previously doubted by Department officials.Will the Minister of State indicate if the Minister, the Department or the OPW has identified a site for the provision of a school in Kinvara?  Sites have been on offer.  Has the Department investigated the suitability of a site?  If so, is it necessary to advertise for a site to be identified?  It is important that the Department proceeds quickly and follows the procedures in place to avoid further delay in this instance.I ask that the Minister clearly states that she is committed to the early start and fast tracking of the provision of a school in the area to ensure that the trustees can respond further by allowing a continuation of the intake of first year students until 2012 when they indicated they would withdraw from the provision of second level education in Kinvara.The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Kitt, and Deputy Higgins, both having represented that area over the years, understand the need for the continuation of educational provision in this area of south Galway.  I urge the Minister of State to reciprocate the positive response of the trustees.  I acknowledge that the Minister has restored the board of management under what is termed an independent chairperson.  All that has happened to date is positive.  The onus is now on the Minister and the Department building unit to move quickly so we can work positively with the community, the staff, the board of management and parent committee to ensure we will continue to have second level education in the area.  Everybody agrees the school can no longer remain a girls' only school, but that we will have a co-educational school.  We are aware of the need in that part of County Galway as there will be a deficit of approximately 1,400 school places in the area by 2012.  The continuation of an educational facility in Kinvara will help to avoid that crisis.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the position regarding the provision of post-primary education in Kinvara, County Galway.On 16 May 2007, the Minister for Education and Science announced the provision of a new second level school for the Kinvara area.  This decision was and remains predicated on the Mercy Order, as trustees of Seamount college, accepting first year students each year until the end of the 2011-12 school year.  Subsequent to the announcement by the Minister for Education and Science, the trustees did indeed accept first year students this September.  The trustees in announcing their decision also indicated that their decision to close Seamount college by 2012 stands.The Deputy will appreciate planning for a new school involves a number of processes which can take some time to complete, most notably the acquisition of a suitable site; the design of a building, the grant of planning permission, the seeking of tenders and construction.  Many of these factors are outside the direct control of the Department.  At present, the commission on school accommodation is continuing its work on the identification of accommodation needs in the south Galway area, including the position relating to provision in Kinvara.  Further progression of a new second level school to serve the area will be developed having regard to the positions I have outlined.I thank Deputy Burke once again for raising the matter.  My Government colleagues, Deputies Michael Kitt and Noel Treacy, have also pressed the Minister on this issue, as have other Deputies from the Clare area.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The Residential Institutions Redress Board was established under Statute in 2002 to provide financial redress to victims of child abuse in residential institutions in order to assist them in their recovery and enhance the quality of the remainder of their lives.I wish to advise the Deputy that expenditure associated with the Redress Board to date is approximately €714 million including €91m in legal costs. The Board has completed the process in 9,276 cases out of a total of 14,546 applications received by the Board. The average award figure currently stands at €67,755, with awards ranging up to €300,000.  At this point it is estimated that a provision of some €428 million may be required to meet the remaining award, administration and legal costs, of the Board. This would bring the total cost of the scheme to an estimated €1.14 billion. Based on the total number of applications received, the final cost of the scheme may be somewhere between €1 billion and €1.3 billion, including legal and admin costs which are running at approximately 20% of awards.  I should emphasise, however, that this revised estimate, like earlier estimates, is tentative as the Board has some 5,270 outstanding applications to process and the level of award in these remaining cases may vary substantially. The final cost of the scheme will not be known until the Board has completed its work, which may take up to a further 3 years.Of course, the final cost of the redress scheme must be viewed in the context of the Government's acceptance of its responsibilities in apologising to victims of abuse and one must consider that if the scheme had not been introduced the State in all likelihood would have been engaged in civil court actions which would have been protracted and traumatic for the victims and would have resulted in the State incurring extensive legal and settlement costs.  The Government in establishing the scheme considered it was the just and humane thing to do as the State was responsible for children that were placed in institutions by the courts and other public bodies.  The C & AG has stated that any estimate of the ultimate liability arising from the Redress Scheme is based on assumptions which are impossible to validate and should therefore be treated in a cautionary way.

In addition, they must provide certification that they have attended an approved course in the Gaeltacht.In the case of graduates of St. Mary's College, the language requirement does not arise provided students have successfully completed the Irish language stream of that course.Prior to the establishment of the Teaching Council in Ireland, my Department had traditionally granted provisional recognition to teachers who qualify in Northern Ireland and who are awarded "qualified teacher status" by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland (DENI) and registration by the General Teaching Council of Northern Ireland (GTCNI). Functions relating to recognition and registration of teachers have since transferred to the Teaching Council, which was established on a statutory footing in March 2006.From its establishment on 28 March 2006 to 31 March 2007, a total of 58 applications from Northern Ireland registered teachers were processed by the Teaching Council. A further 25 applications have been received/processed for the period 1 April 2007 to the 28 September 2007.The issue of the teacher mobility and qualifications is one of four specific areas of cooperation agreed between my Department and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.The next Education Sectoral Meeting will take place in November 2007. The issue of how best to take forward issues in respect of teachers' qualifications in order to facilitate cross-border mobility will be discussed, taking into the account the establishment of the relevant Teaching Councils in Ireland and Northern Ireland.The Irish Teaching Council has a statutory responsibility to cooperate with its equivalent organization in the North (the GTCNI) and there is an ongoing relationship between the two bodies. I would expect that the issue of mutual recognition between the Republic and the North will be advanced in this context into the future.Further, under the EU Directives for the Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications, provisions are made whereby professionals qualified in one (home) Member State can seek professional recognition of their qualifications in another (host) Member State for the purpose of practising their profession in that host Member State. These Directives apply only where the profession is regulated in the host Member State, as teaching is in both Ireland and Northern Ireland.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The ICT in Schools Programme commenced in 1998 and aims to provide all pupils with the opportunity to achieve computer literacy and acquire the necessary skills for participation in the Information Society.  There has been significant investment over the period in providing computers to schools, professional development ICT courses for teachers, improving the availability of digital content, integrating ICT into the curriculum and in supporting schools to integrate ICT into their teaching and learning.  The recent priorities under the Programme have been the development of schools' internal networking facilities and the provision of broadband connectivity for schools, which my Department has pursued in partnership with the Telecommunications and Internet Federation within IBEC.There has been considerable progress since the Programme commenced.  The number of computers in schools has increased substantially.  In this regard, the latest available Census undertaken by the NCTE in 2005, found that at primary level, there was one computer for every 9 children, while at post-primary level, there was one computer for every 7 students.  Schools have been grant-aided to develop their internal networking facilities and broadband connectivity has been provided to schools via a National Broadband Network.  Over 130,000 training places have been provided for teachers to improve their ICT skills and assist them to integrate ICT into their teaching practice, while ICT has been included within the pre-service training provided by our teaching training providers.  Scoilnet has been developed as a comprehensive resource for teachers and students and a range of relevant digital content has been created specifically to complement the curriculum.  Schools have been supported to plan for the integration of ICT into their teaching and learning by the National Centre for Technology in Education and the ICT Advisory Service.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed a draft ICT Framework as a practical tool to support teachers in planning and providing opportunities for students to develop their ICT literacy across the curriculum from primary to the end of compulsory education.  New syllabi have been developed for the four technology subjects at Leaving Certificate level, in which ICT is a compulsory integral part of both curriculum and assessment.  Two of these, Technology and Design and Communications Graphics, which involve the use of Computer Aided Design have now been introduced and will be examined in June 2009.  A new Technology Subjects Support Service has been established and schools' have been funded to upgrade their facilities.The Programme for Government sets out our commitment to implementing a comprehensive Schools' ICT Strategy.  This strategy will be underpinned by the investment of €252m in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.I appointed a Strategy Planning Group to advise me on the prioritisation of measures under the planned investment over the period of the NDP.  Among the issues which the new strategy will address are the upgrading and renewal of hardware, the provision of software and digital content for learning, teacher professional development, curriculum development, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools and technical maintenance and support requirements.  I expect to receive the Strategy Planning Group's recommendations shortly.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.Funding from my Department for adult literacy has increased dramatically from just €1 million in 1997 to €30 million in 2007. The 2007 allocation represents an increase of €7.4 million, or 21%, on 2006.As a result of this increased expenditure, the number of literacy places has increased from 5,000 in 1997 to over 40,000 in 2006.  Following on commitments in the "Towards 2016" Partnership Agreement and in the Programme for Government an extra 7,000 literacy places will be provided in the period 2007-2009. I am providing for 3,000 of these additional places in 2007.The increased financial provision this year also allows for an expansion of the Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education Programme, which was launched in 2006. In addition, a family literacy pilot scheme is being developed this autumn to address poor literacy from an intergenerational family perspective.To ensure a multi-pronged approach is adopted my Department has, in partnership with NALA, used the medium of television to reach an even wider audience. The "Read, Write Now" series, from 2000 to 2005, and the more recent "Really Useful Guide to Words and Numbers" in 2006/2007 provided learners with an opportunity to improve their literacy skills from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. Funding for a new series has been made available.There are also a number of schemes funded by my Department which target people with special literacy needs, e.g. deaf people, people with dyslexia and a literacy service in Irish for people in Gaeltacht areas.Adult literacy and numeracy are also an integral component for learners in both the part-time and full-time suite of further education programmes.In addition, there are workplace literacy schemes in operation around the country.  A workplace literacy programme, called Return to Learning Scheme, has been introduced in all Local Authority areas for outdoor workers. Under the FÁS/VEC Return to Education Scheme, participants on the Community Employment Scheme, operated by FÁS, can be released from their work experience programmes to avail themselves of intensive literacy tuition provided by the Vocational Education Committees.In 2005, and again in 2006, FÁS spent €2 million on addressing the literacy and numeracy needs of staff in the workplace. An additional €1 million is being provided in 2007, bringing the total funding to €3 million for this scheme.In addition to the wide range of initiatives I have just outlined, a far greater emphasis has been put on improving children's literacy skills in recent years. We are prioritising early intervention so that children's literacy problems do not become entrenched and carry with them into adulthood.Significant progress has therefore been made, and continues to be made, in addressing the needs of both children and adults with low levels of literacy. The Government's targets for the coming years are designed to be both challenging and achievable.

In recent years the charge has been increased from €750 for the academic year 2004/05, to €775 in 2005/06, to €800 in 2006/07 and now stands at €825 for 2007/08, an increase of €25 per student per annum.All students who are eligible for a means tested student support grant have the student charge paid on their behalf by the Local Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees, in addition to any maintenance grant and tuition fee grant to which they are entitled.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	287	In recent years, unprecedented levels of investment has been provided both to improve existing school facilities and to provide extra school places where they are needed. Improved forward planning has also been put in place through greater cooperation between the Department of Education and local authorities and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans by my Department.This combination of investment and planning has allowed extensions to be built to schools all over Ireland, while many new schools have also been built in order to meet the needs of developing areas.Construction work this year alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils – mainly in developing areas.Turning to the specific issue of school places in Balbriggan as raised by the Deputy, the situation is as follows. Conscious of the fact that Balbriggan is a developing area, the Department of Education has facilitated a significant expansion in the number of school places in the area in recent years. Established schools have been given extra teachers and accommodation, while new schools also opened in 2005 and 2006.  Educate Together had also indicated their intention to open a new school in Balbriggan in 2008. At the same time, the Department has been working with Fingal County Council to acquire land for new school buildings.Given the population expansion that has been taking place in Balbriggan, Department officials kept the enrolments situation under review over the summer, in consultation with the existing schools. As soon as it became clear that applications for the schools had grown to such an extent that a new school would be needed this year, my Department acted swiftly to secure accommodation for up to 120 children in a new school in Sunshine House.Educate Together agreed to be the patron of the school and I would like to express my thanks to them for working with us to open the school within such a tight timeframe. I would also like to convey my thanks to the principal of the school whom I know had a difficult first few week with all the media focus on the school and who is deeply committed to ensuring that her pupils get a top quality education.It was never the Department's intention to establish schools solely for children of a particular ethnic background. However, in a situation where these children were potentially being left without places, a new school was the only option.The current ethnic make-up of Bracken Educate Together National School is reflective of the nature of the families that had moved to the area recently. It is not the result of any unwillingness on the part of the existing schools to accept children of any particular ethnicity or religion. In fact some of the existing schools have quite large numbers of newcomer children enrolled. I know many people in Balbriggan were very upset by the implications in some sectors of the media that there was any form of racism at play here.The Department intends to work with all schools in the area to help achieve a better spread of children of all nationalities across the different schools in future years. Common enrolment policies may be one way of achieving this.I accept that providing sufficient pupil places in all rapidly developing areas, including those with large immigrant communities, is absolutely vital to ensuring that enrolment policies do not lead to immigrants being unable to secure places.Under the National Development Plan, €4.5 billion is being invested to improve existing school buildings and provide extra accommodation for an expected growth of 100,000 in the school-going population over the coming years. Together with the improvements in planning that have already been put in place, and those that are provided for in the new Programme for Government, this will enable my Department to meet the needs of developing areas into the future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I am conscious of the challenges that moving to a different country poses for many people, especially where a different language is spoken in the new location. These challenges are particularly acute in cases where children are involved and where neither they, nor their parents, speak the language of their new home.My Department gives an annual grant to all Vocational Education Committees for the provision of Adult Literacy and Community Education. The cost of the literacy service delivered by the VECs in 2006 was over €20 million. To cater for the needs of adult migrants there is a facility, within the adult literacy service, for those who wish to improve their English to participate in English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses. In 2005 there were 10,000 places availed of for ESOL courses and this rose to 12,000 in 2006. This later figure constitutes 30% of the adult literacy places within the adult literacy service.The language needs of migrants formed part of the negotiations between social partners in drawing up the new social partnership agreement "Towards 2016". A prioritised action included in the agreement is that the annual student cohort availing of the general national literacy service delivered by the Vocational Education Committees will be significantly increased by the provision of an extra 7,000 places by 2009, 3,000 of which will be provided this year. There will be a particular focus on increasing the number of migrants receiving an English language service (ESOL) under the terms of the agreement. We are also committed under the Programme for Government to providing dedicated funding for English language training for targeted groups.My Department, in conjunction with the Office for Integration, has commissioned an independent review to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally-resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation. This is due for completion in early 2008.In addition, information on the Irish Education system has been placed on the Department's Website (www.education.ie) in 6 languages, i.e. Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and German.The importance of addressing the educational needs of newcomers has been emphasised by the establishment by the Government of the Office for Integration and the appointment by the Taoiseach of my colleague Conor Lenihan TD as the Minister for Integration. Minister Lenihan is also a Minister of State in my Department and his Office will greatly help the development of a co-ordinated and cohesive response to the integration of newcomers to Ireland. In particular, it will focus upon the work undertaken by three Government Departments: Education and Science; Justice, Equality & Law Reform; and Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	289	As of the 31st December, 2006, there were a total of 733 Post-Primary schools operating in the State.  Of these, 91 are Community or Comprehensive Schools which are owned by my Department and 248 are Vocational Schools/Community Colleges that are owned by the relevant Vocational Education Committee. The remainder (394) are Voluntary Secondary Schools, which are privately-owned and primarily run by Religious Orders.Since 2000 my Department has invested over €3 billion as part of the upgrading of existing school infrastructure and the provision of new school accommodation in primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  This is the largest investment programme in the history of the State and delivered over 9,000 projects which have transformed the standard of accommodation in these schools.My Department's policy is to protect investment in non State owned property by way of long-term lease agreements.  The purpose of these lease agreements is to allow the State to re-coup some or all of its investment in privately-owned school properties in the event that these properties are no longer used for educational purposes. Given the numbers of projects delivered over recent years if the Deputy wishes to clarify the situation in respect of investment in individual cases then I would be happy to provide him with the information.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I am acutely aware of the need to address the demands placed on students in the Leaving Certificate written examinations each June. I have indicated that I favour a change to the current position with a view to reducing some of the existing pressures on students.  I see scope for adjusting the subject spread over the initial days of the Leaving Certificate examination in order to provide for some reduction in the writing load for students in the early period of the June exams. I have also indicated that I see scope for students to sit their first paper in Leaving Certificate English on a Saturday in May.  This would enable them to approach the initial days of the examination with another element of a major subject completed.I have asked the State Examinations Commission to engage with the partners in education on the matter and this process is ongoing.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I propose to continue to operate grant schemes towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families at primary and post-primary level and to provide additional funding as resources permit. Schools are notified of the details of the schemes each year by circular letter.For the purposes of these grants, a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, singe parenthood, or other family circumstances (such as substance abuse) which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.At primary level a total of €5,350,000 — an increase of €1,350,000 on the allocation for the 2005/06 school year — was allocated in respect of the school books scheme in the 2006/2007 school year. The allocation for 2006/2007 included an amount of €0.5m which was made available under the School Books Grant Scheme to primary schools in the School Support Programme (SSP) under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion. An additional €0.25m has been provided for this purpose in 2007.  The allocation for 2007 is €5,877,000.Schools participating in the SSP that indicated that they would operate a book/loan rental scheme in 2006/2007 received grant aid at a higher rate per eligible pupil than applied in the case of schools generally. The extra funding is aimed at supporting the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes.This schemes provides assistance towards the cost of school books thereby  ensuring that  pupils from low-income families will have access to all necessary books at a nominal fee or even free of charge.Approximately 142,000 primary school pupils were assisted under the scheme in 2006.At second level, in addition to the provision of grants towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils, my Department also provides seed capital funding to certain schools in order to assist in the establishment of book loan/rental schemes. These would be schools designated as disadvantaged or which participate in schemes aimed at combating educational disadvantage.School returns furnished to my Department to date show that approximately 132,000 pupils at second level were assisted under the scheme in the 2006/2007 school year.Expenditure on the School Books Grant Scheme in second-level schools in 2006 was €7.518m, of which some €0.8m was provided for the establishment/ongoing support of book loan/rental schemes.The 2007 allocation is €7.941m and €0.9m of this has been allocated for book loan/rental schemes.As I indicated already the question of providing additional funding under the school books grant scheme will be considered in the context of available resources.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	293	As the Deputy will be aware the Primary and Second-Level schools have a responsibility to provide a broad, balanced and appropriate curriculum for all students. Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is now part of the curriculum for all pupils in primary schools.  It provides specific opportunities to enable the child to understand himself or herself, to develop healthy relationships, and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.SPHE has been compulsory in the junior cycle of second-level schools since September 2003.  It provides students with a unique opportunity to develop the skills and competence to learn about themselves and to care for themselves and others and to make informed decisions about their health, personal lives and social development.Modules at junior cycle deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, bullying, dealing with peer pressure, coping with stress, emotional health and well-being, influences on decision-making, and relationships and sexuality education.  In third year, an awareness of the range of agencies which can help students in difficulty is promoted, as well as the skills of knowing when and how to seek help.  SPHE is designed for implementation in the context of a caring whole-school approach which is supported by the pastoral care structures in schools.The implementation of the SPHE curriculum by schools is a very important strand of Government policy in addressing a range of social and health issues covered by a wide range of policies/strategies, including the National Drugs Strategy, the National Suicide Prevention Strategy and the report of the National Task Force on Obesity.Work on the development of a curriculum for SPHE in Senior Cycle is now at an advanced stage and the Department looks forward to receiving the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's (NCCA) recommendations in the matter.Schools also use Mental Health Matters, a resource pack on mental health for 14 to 18 year olds developed by Mental Health Ireland on an optional basis as a module in the Transition Year Programme, an element of the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme, a component of the SPHE programme or an element of other subjects such as Religion or Home Economics.All post-primary schools receive ex-quota hours from my Department for the provision of a guidance and counselling service to students. The service is delivered in the majority of schools by guidance counsellors who are qualified to provide counselling support to students.Schools can also use additional resources provided by my Department under various initiatives to buy in the services of a qualified counsellor/psychotherapist if they consider this necessary to meet students' needs. For example, schools participating in Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS), the School Completion Programme and the Guidance Enhancement Initiative (GEI) can, and do, use some of the resources received under these initiatives to buy in counselling services.My Department provides funding to the Institute of Guidance Counsellors (IGC) for a programme of professional supervision for its members. In its first year, 75% of guidance counsellors participated in this programme which is operated through education centres on a national basis. Approximately 60 qualified counsellors provide support and advice on a range of counselling and mental health issues to the guidance counsellors who are participating in the programme. In addition, my Department provides funding to each of the sixteen branches of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors to support the provision of continuous professional development for the members of each branch.Through the Education Equality Initiative the Department has funded Schizophrenia Ireland to design and develop training materials for educators and students who self-experience mental illness; to implement awareness training programmes for staff in further education colleges; to set up support structures for people with self experience who aspire to attend Further Education courses and to research good practice in Ireland and abroad.Third Level Learning support services provided to students with mental health difficulties include one-to-one specialist tuition and subject specific tuition.  One-to-one specialist tuition provides students with organisation, communication and learning skills to cope with the demands of social, personal and academic integration into Higher Education.  Additional subject specific tuition may be provided to compensate for lectures missed due to absences, hospital appointments, effects of medication etc.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	294	There are approximately 3,400 primary schools in the country. The number of schools currently engaged in amalgamation discussions is difficult to determine given that the decision making authority for amalgamation ultimately belongs to the school patrons. The reasons for amalgamation can be many and varied ranging from, demography (decline in enrolments) to desire for co-education, to financial reasons, to condition of school buildings, to parental/teacher demand etc.  Should the Deputy require information in relation to a particular amalgamation, I would be happy to arrange to have this provided.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 134, 150, 158 and 384 together.The OECD report to which the Deputies refer relates to 2004 and hence does not capture the extra investment that has been put into Irish education in the past three years. In fact, the education budget this year, at €8.6 billion, is €2 billion or 30% higher than in 2004.The report also doesn't capture the thousands of extra teachers hired since 2004.  As a result of all these extra teachers, we now have one teacher for every 16 students at primary level and one for every 13 at second level. However, putting aside the progress since 2004, the report highlights that even at that point, Ireland had the second highest increase in total public expenditure on education between 1995 and 2004 of all the OECD countries surveyed.It also showed how Irish students are performing significantly better than those in other developed countries on a whole range of important measures. For example, the reading ability of Irish 15 year olds was far better than the international average. 91% of Irish 25-34 year olds had completed at least upper second level education or an equivalent course such as a FÁS qualification – compared with an OECD average of 82%. The proportion of the population aged 25-34 with higher education in Ireland at 41% was well above the OECD average of 32%. Ireland was in the top three (with Spain and Finland) most socially equitable countries in terms of educational outcomes and access to higher education. The number of science graduates per 100,000 of employed 25-34 year olds in Ireland was the second highest in the OECD. Third level drop-out rates in Ireland were also significantly below the international average.At the end of the day, in education it is the outcomes that matter and Ireland's educational outcomes are something to be proud of.This Government is determined to ensure that Irish students continue to benefit from an excellent education system. To this end, we have already committed €32 billion to education over the next seven years under the new National Development Plan.We are planning for increased enrolments in our schools, improvements in the curriculum, massive investment in our school building programme and greater participation in 3rd and 4th level education.In relation to issue of funding for third level education in Ireland, I would like to point out that public investment in higher education here has increased significantly in recent years. The overall provision for the higher education sector amounts to some €1.9 billion for 2007.  This represents more than a doubling of the funding made available in 1997.  Investment in higher education will increase further under the NDP.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	296	As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.  Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment).  In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	297	The commitment in the Programme for Government is to examine how local authorities might grant allow schools a reasonable level of usage of water and waste services without charge, and that charges would only apply when a school exceeded the allowance.The Deputy will appreciate that it is a primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to determine precisely how this commitment will be implemented.  A key consideration from my perspective is to ensure that any proposed scheme ensures that schools are treated consistently across the country.  My Department will of course input to and support the examination to be conducted by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I propose to take Questions Nos. 128, 144 and 156 together.As the Deputy will be aware, many positive developments in relation to the teaching of Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) have taken place in recent years, and these have been further strengthened through making Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) a mandatory programme for junior cycle since September 2003.  In addition, all schools are required to have an RSE programme at senior cycle.Schools are currently supported in the implementation of RSE by the SPHE and RSE Support Services which are provided in collaboration with the health sector.  The supports available to schools include guidelines on policy development, curricula and teacher guidelines, information for parents, teaching resource materials and teacher training.  Schools are also encouraged to utilise the resources produced by the Health Promotion Unit.Earlier this year I launched the report "RSE in the context of SPHE: An assessment of the Challenges to the Full Implementation of the Programme in Post-primary Schools" published jointly by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency and my Department.  The report highlighted widespread support for both the broad principles and the content of the SPHE and RSE programme from teachers, parents and health professionals and strong levels of interest and support from parents and students as to the importance of RSE in schoolsThe report also demonstrated increasing levels of implementation compared with earlier studies, with 76% of schools showing high or moderate levels of implementation, and with 90% of schools teaching RSE at some level.  However, a clear need is highlighted to strengthen both implementation levels and consistency in regard to the content of RSE.  The immediate priorities are to increase the levels of implementation of RSE and promote consistency in how the content is addressed.  To this end, the following actions are being taken: remind all post-primary schools of their obligations in this area; update and re-issue the RSE policy guidelines and finalise a template on RSE policy in order to facilitate schools in developing and implementing RSE programmes; review and update RSE materials; develop lesson plans linked to a DVD resource on contraception, sexually transmitted infections and sexual orientation, in collaboration with the Health Services Executive and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  (Contract has been awarded on this project); increase the level of information & training available to parents, building on a successful primary model and introduce a programme of subject inspections in this area with effect from 2007/8The availability of a national curriculum in SPHE at junior cycle has played a vital role in supporting increased implementation of RSE.  I am aware of the development work undertaken to date by the NCCA in relation to a Social Personal and Health Education programme at senior cycle.  This is now at an advanced stage, and I look forward to receiving the NCCA's recommendations in this regard at an early date.The Inspectorate has undertaken a thematic review of SPHE in 40 primary schools.  [RSE is a component of SPHE].  In the context of this review, which is currently underway, the Inspectorate will ask parents of 5th year pupils for their views on the SPHE curriculum and it's implementation.  Reports arising from this review along with a composite report will be published by the Department on it's website.  I am confident that these initiatives will help to ensure full implementation of this vital aspect of social education regardless of gender mix within the school.

Since then, 1.7 million students Europe-wide, including 24,292 students from Ireland, have engaged in study periods abroad under the programme. In 1987, 112 Irish students participated in the programme; this figure rose to 1567 students in 2005-06.In 2005-06, Irish students spent periods abroad at a variety of universities in 23 different countries, with the three most popular destinations being France (31%), Spain (18%) and Germany (17%).  I can arrange to have further statistical information supplied to the Deputy if required.The Higher Education Authority (HEA) acts as the Irish national agency for the Erasmus programme on behalf of my Department.  The HEA promotes, manages and allocates funding to the institutions covered by the programme to support students, teachers and staff from this country who wish to engage in mobility periods abroad. The HEA is in frequent contact with the International Officers of the participating Higher Education Institutions.  Regular face-to-face meetings are held with the International Officers to brief them on the implementation of the programme and to gather feedback on the experiences of the institutions, students and staff.  So far in 2007, the HEA has had three direct contacts with International Officers and a further meeting is planned before the end of the year.  A conference and a celebratory event to mark the 20th anniversary of Erasmus have also been held this year.  Both events had student representation present.To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of Erasmus this year, the HEA published a booklet recounting the experiences of students who had undertaken a study visit.  The experiences have been extremely positive and terms like "life changing experience", "confidence building", "language improvement", "friendships made", "networks forged" are just some of the comments made.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I would like to thank the Deputy for the opportunity to outline the services in curriculum development provided at primary school level by the relevant support services/agencies.  The Primary Curriculum Support Service (PCSP) was set up to mediate the Primary School Curriculum for teachers and to enable them to implement it in their schools.  The programme of support delivered to date has spanned the introduction of the curriculum, in-service on specific curricular areas and consolidation and review of certain curricular areas.The end of the academic year 2006/2007 saw the completion of the implementation schedule for the Primary School Curriculum.  The PCSP is being maintained to provide targeted support and assistance to schools across the spectrum of curricular issues. The Regional Curriculum Support Service (RCSS) is part of the PCSP service for schools.  RCSS Cuiditheoirí operate at local and regional level in co-operation with the Education Centre Network.  They provide school visits, drop-in sessions and afternoon/evening workshops in Education Centres countrywide.  Continuous Professional Development at primary level will focus on a number of specific areas moving from a traditional context based approach to an approach emphasising teaching methodologies and issues relating to teaching and learning, including the use of active learning and teaching approaches.Leadership Development for Schools (LDS) is a DES initiative that started in 2002.  Its brief is to provide professional development for school leaders at primary and post-primary level with a view to building capacity in schools towards sustained educational improvement for staff and children.  The Support Service operates from Clare Education Centre and offers a range of programmes aimed at both experienced and newly appointed principals.My Department also provides funding for continuing professional development to the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN) as a contribution to more effective and efficient teaching and learning in schools by providing the necessary skills and supports to principals.  The provision of direct funding to the IPPN is done within the context of policy objectives and overall strategy in relation to continuing professional development, including the need for a regional and national dimension for any supported activity.I hope the Deputy agrees that I continue, through the work of my Department, to make available in service support for teachers in the light of needs as they emerge.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	301	I take the issue of bullying in schools, in all of its forms, including homophobic bullying very seriously and my Department and I are strongly committed to removing all barriers to full participation in education, including barriers caused by the sexual orientation of students.The Deputy will be aware that the education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum.  SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.All recognised primary and second level schools are required to offer Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) which is an integral part of the SPHE curriculum at primary level and at Junior Cycle second level where it has been made mandatory for all schools.  In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable Relationships and Sexuality Education programme in place for senior cycle pupils.  Comprehensive guidelines for Junior and Senior cycle have also been published and provided to schools by the NCCA to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum.  An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is being developed.The SPHE modules at junior cycle in second level schools deal specifically with Belonging and Integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision-making, relationships and sexuality in terms of values, reproductive system, tackling myths about sex and pregnancy, personal safety, substance use and the impact of teenage pregnancy.  Two of the SPHE modules relate specifically to Relationships and Sexuality and Personal Safety.  The aims of these modules include bringing students to an understanding of the physical changes that take place during adolescence and exploring with them procedures for protecting their personal safety along with appropriate responses when their safety is threatened.  In third year, an awareness of help agencies is promoted and students' skills for obtaining access to them are developed.For senior cycle students, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable Relationships and Sexuality Education Programme in place.  The RSE programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues and, in addition, addresses issues such as pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and accepting sexual orientation.The Department of Education and Science has developed two sets of resource materials that are particularly relevant to this area for use with Transition Year and senior cycle students as part of an SPHE programme.  These are BALANCE — Who cares? and Exploring Masculinities.  These resources use a variety of materials and strategies to explore and discuss issues of gender equality.  Specific attention is paid to addressing both sexual harassment and domestic violence in both resources. Also included in the Exploring Masculinities resources are materials on bullying and child sexual abuse.The Deputy will also be aware that each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline.  Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard.  These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.The Deputy may also be interested to know that dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme.  I have also stressed to the teacher unions the importance of not just having a written policy on bullying but also ensuring a climate in which it is not tolerated in any form and in which children know that if they make a teacher aware of bullying that it will be dealt with.Responsibility for tackling bullying naturally falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established.  I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that so many supports have been put in place in recent years.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 407 together.My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students.  These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses.The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.  Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, means and previous academic attainment.The Nationality requirement as set out in the 2007 Grant schemes states that candidates must hold E.U. Nationality; or have Official Refugee Status; or have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State (prior to the Immigration Act 1999); or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or be nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland.A non-EU national who has been granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of an Irish born child does not comply with the above conditions and is ineligible for grant assistance under the nationality requirements of the schemes.Any extension to the scope of the maintenance grants schemes, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.  I do not believe that this policy is contrary to the legislation cited.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	303	As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002.  By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc.  In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year.  Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled.  The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years.  We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	304	Over the last two years, a package of measures to enhance the safety of school transport operations has been put into effect.  This includes the phasing out of three-for-two seating arrangements and the installation of seat belts on all vehicles operating under my Department's school transport scheme.  Given the progress that has been made, it is of course disappointing to note that the rate of wearing of seat belts, especially in the case of post-primary students, is not higher.  However, I would emphasise that the position is more encouraging at primary level and I would like to think that this is a positive trend which I will be seeking to reinforce.I see education and awareness-building as the best approach to promoting safety-consciousness among school transport users and their parents.  Towards that end, a safety campaign launched at the end of August, as children were preparing to return to school, highlighted the fact that it is the law to wear a seat belt and encouraged children to "belt up" whilst travelling on the school bus.  In addition, my Department and Bus Éireann, in association with the Road Safety Authority, are currently examining the feasibility of a further safety campaign specifically aimed at older children.Bus Éireann has also issued a circular to parents of children travelling on school transport, inviting their co-operation, and that of their children, to help make the school transport journey as safe and comfortable as possible.  The circular emphasises the importance of safety, the consequences of misbehaviour and the disciplinary measures which may be necessary.  I can assure the House that I will continue to promote safety-conscious behaviour on school transport services as a matter of the highest priority.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The Government published the Report of the Expert Group on Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) on 22nd March, 2007, which examined a wide range of issues in relation to potential health effects of EMF, including those produced by mobile telecommunications.  The Expert Group was chaired by Dr Michael Repacholi, former Coordinator, Radiation and Environmental Health Unit, World Health Organisation.  The Group concluded that so far, no adverse short or long-term health effects have been found from exposure to the radio frequency signals produced by mobile phones and base station transmitters and that radio frequency signals have not been found to cause cancer.While I am aware of some media attention on the question of health effects associated with wireless local area networks in schools in the national media and in the UK, the UK Health Protection Agency has similarly concluded that on the basis of current evidence, it does not consider there to be a problem with the safety of wireless local area networks.The latest data available on the types of networks used by schools is contained in the 2005 Census on ICT infrastructure in schools undertaken by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE).  The Census found that 3% of primary schools, 1.4% of post-primary and 2% of special schools used a wireless link only, while 7.2% of primary, 16.3% of post-primary and 8.8% of special schools used a combination of fixed and wireless networks.  I am aware that many schools have availed of the grants provided by my Department since December, 2004 to schools to develop their internal networking capability.  The NCTE drew up guidelines on Computer Networking in Schools which set out the requirements to be met by schools in relation to the expenditure of these grants.  While these grants may, in some instances, have been expended on wireless networks, the NCTE observed in its guidelines that in general, wired networking should be used noting that wired networks can, in many situations, be more reliable than wireless networks.I would also mention that since 2004, all school building projects are required to comply with my Department's ICT Infrastructure Guidelines for Schools which involve complete cabling installation.  These Guidelines acknowledge that in some existing schools it may not be possible to install a complete cabling installation, e.g. in listed buildings, larger schools with limited distribution zones or existing remote buildings.  In these cases, the Guidelines allow the use of a wireless Ethernet to be considered as a component of an overall structured cabling infrastructure.As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has transferred responsibility for the health effects of EMF to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister will be bringing details of the broader mandate for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to the Cabinet for approval.  The Government has also agreed to establish a national research programme to undertake further research in Ireland on the health effects of exposure to EMF and I will be liaising with my colleagues to ensure that my Department is kept appraised of any developments in relation to the health effects of wireless local area networks.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I believe that standardised testing, carried out on a systematic basis, has great potential to enhance the quality of teaching and learning for our students at classroom level, and to provide valuable information for parents about their children's learning.I have accepted the advice from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) that, as part of a range of assessment approaches, all pupils should take standardised tests in English reading and Mathematics at the end of first class or the beginning of second class,and at the end of fourth class or the beginning of fifth class.My Department has issued a Circular Letter to primary schools requesting that they ensure that standardised testing is implemented on an annual basis in the relevant classes beginning in the calendar year 2007. With effect from 2007/8, the results of testing will be reported to parents in respect of their own children in accordance with a broader reporting template, designed to report progress on children's learning to parents. This template was piloted in a number of selected schools by the NCCA.The introduction of the measure is being supported by a national programme of teacher professional development in assessment for learning. This will aim to support teachers in placing assessment at the heart of the teaching and learning process, supporting children's cognitive, creative, affective, physical and social development. It is intended that all teachers and principals will have access to the programme on a rolling basis.A grant of €1.65m issued to schools in December 2006 for the cost of test materials, teachers' manuals, test scoring services or test-related software.  It is intended that the implementation of standardised testing at school level will be complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring so that national trends in different categories of school can be tracked over time.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	310	My Department does not  intend to distribute world maps using Peters projection to schools.  Post-primary schools are supplied with an equipment list and specifications for a Social Studies room in the context of a refurbishment, extension or the provision of a new school building. This equipment list and specifications (coded as Environmental and Social Studies — ESS) is also available on my Department's website and can be accessed by schools and subject departments for guidance in updating their teaching resources. This ESS equipment list and specifications was updated in 2005 in line with syllabus changes at Leaving Certificate Geography and History. This revised list includes the  Political Wall Map of World  Winkel equal area projection.Prior to 2005 it was recommended that schools purchase maps using Peters projection through the ESS Social studies room equipment list and specifications.  This was changed to a Winkel projection following the 2005 revision of syllabi.  Schools may have purchased world maps using Mercator's projection in the past but these were not recommended in the ESS list and specifications.Geography and History teachers use wall maps and globes as teaching resources.The globe is a true three-dimensional representation of the earth's shape and structure. A wall map will always be an approximation as it uses a projection to represent a sphere on a two-dimensional flat surface. The Mercator projection, created in 1569, was used by sailors and navigators as it represented lines of longitude and latitude as straight lines. However, the Mercator projection distorts the shape of land masses and shows both Africa and South America as being significantly smaller in size.  This projection increases the size of land masses in the northern hemisphere and reduces those in the southern hemisphere.  This issue came into particular focus as development studies began to address inequality and population growth in the developing world. Mercator's projection seems to present a "first world" view of economic development based on colonialism and exploitation by distorting the physical area of the earth and the poorest "third world"areas.This was challenged by the Peters projection of 1973.  This is one of many equal area projections. The maps using these projections represent land masses in proportion to their areas. The Peters projection is favoured by development agencies as it more accurately represents the size and shape of countries in the developing world.  However this projection is visually challenging for students as the northern hemisphere is flattened and elongated.My Department now recommends, through the ESS equipment list and specifications, that schools purchase the world map using the Winkel equal area projection. This projection reduces the distortion of the shape and area of landmasses and visually represents the relative proportion and position of landmasses and ocean areas for geography students.In the Primary School Curriculum and in the revised Leaving Certificate Geography Syllabus students and their teachers are encouraged to challenge perceptions of the shape of the earth created by projections. The presence of Mercator's, Peter's or Winkel's projection in the classroom should assist teachers to critically evaluate these representations of the earth.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The Joint Committee Report of the Provision of Educational Services in a Multi-Ethnic/Multi-Cultural Society, which was published in April of 2004, is an important snap-shot of the educational needs of newcomers at a particular point in time.I am pleased that since its publication, a great deal of work has been done in this area, which addresses the issues highlighted in the Report.The importance of addressing the educational needs of newcomers has been emphasised by the establishment by the Government of the Office for Integration and the appointment by the Taoiseach of my colleague Conor Lenihan TD as the Minister for Integration. Minister Lenihan is also a Minister of State in my Department and his Office will greatly help the development of a co-ordinated and cohesive response to the integration of newcomers to Ireland. In particular, it will focus upon the work undertaken by three Government Departments: Education and Science; Justice, Equality & Law Reform; and Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs.Since the publication of the Joint Committee's Report, my Department has secured a number of achievements in regard to the educational integration of newcomers. These achievements are as follows:Language Support Teachers are provided at primary and post-primary levels to those schools which have newcomer pupils who do not have English as their first language. As Minister, I removed the ‘cap' of two Language Support Teachers per school and extended the provision of language support beyond two years. As a result, some schools with a large number of newcomer children without English as their first language have up to 6 Language Support Teachers.Towards 2016 provides for the provision of an extra 550 language support teachers by 2009 including 200 teachers (175 primary and 25 post-primary) in 2007, with a further 150 in 2008 and 200 in 2009. This will bring the overall number of such teachers to approximately 1,800 by 2009 (there are currently 1,450).Language assessment kits, based on best international practice are to be provided to all primary schools during the 2007/08 school year. The kits will enable accurate initial and on-going assessment of language proficiency of newcomer children with a particular focus upon assessing whether language support needs to be provided beyond the current two year limit.NCCA intercultural guidelines to support teachers and schools in developing a more inclusive learning environment and in providing students with knowledge and skills they need to participate in a multicultural world. Corresponding guidelines for intercultural education in post-primary schools have also been made available by the NCCA.My Department continues to provide funding to Integrate Ireland Language Training (IILT) to provide Language Support Teachers with in-service training to assist them in meeting the English language needs of their pupils/students.The Department has distributed a resource book ("Up and Away") for English Language Support Teachers to all primary schools which will serve as the basis for induction seminars for newly appointed Language Support Teachers.Information on the Irish Education system has been placed on the Department's Website (www.education.ie) in 6 languages including Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and German.An information pack for newcomer parents has been developed on a North/South basis. The pack will include information on education services, adult and community education programmes along with information on the health services, welfare entitlements, housing allocations, etc.A practical toolkit for schools has been developed to facilitate capacity building for intercultural issues on a whole-school basis which will be targeted at mainstream classroom teachers. this will be distributed to schools in 2008.The Department, in conjunction with the Office for Integration, have commissioned an independent review to assist in the development of a national English language training policy and framework for legally-resident adult immigrants based on extensive stakeholder consultation. This is due for completion in early 2008.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	314	There are currently 56 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant, 2 Inter-denominational, one Jewish and the remainder Catholic.  Fee-charging schools, with the exception of the Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools for which special arrangements apply, do not receive capitation or related supports.  Protestant fee-charging schools receive funding through a block grant.  This grant has its origins in the desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant and Jewish persuasions to attend schools which reflect their denominational ethos, and it includes payments in respect of capitation.In addition, Protestant and Jewish fee-charging schools are eligible for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant, the secretarial grant and caretaking grant.  Figures for the allocation of these grants in the 2007/08 school year are not yet available.  The Deputy should note that fee-charging schools not embraced by the Block Grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports.Teachers in fee-charging schools are paid by the State, irrespective of the school's religious ethos.  The payment of teachers' salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions.  This may well reflect a long standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.  Salary figures for teachers in fee-charging schools for the 2007/08 school year are not yet availableMinority religion schools also receive capital funding for building projects and have done so under successive Governments on the same basis as other secondary schools while approximately 50% of capital costs for Catholic fee-charging schools building projects are met by the State.  However, school building projects, whether for fee charging schools or schools in the free education sector, are selected for inclusion in the Schools' Building and Modernisation Programme on the basis of priority of need.  In that regard the Deputy should note that the proportion of the school building programme spent in fee-charging schools in recent years has been extremely small.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	315	The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism, receive an education appropriate to their needs.     I am determined to ensure that all children get the support they need to reach their full potential. I am particularly conscious that the parents of children with special needs are under much pressure and give much dedicated time and commitment to their children. It is also true that the record of the State over decades in providing for children with special needs was very poor and that we are still playing catch-up. However, significant advances have been made in recent years, improving the lives of children with special needs and their families.With regard to specific provision for children with autism, the Government believes that as each child with autism is unique; such children should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.Applied behavioural analysis, or ABA, is one of the methods used in special classes for children with autism. An issue of contention which arises is whether one particular methodology should be the dominant in some settings.Advice received from international experts on autism, the National Educational Psychological Service and the inspectorate inform the Department of Education and Science's view that a range of approaches should be used, rather than just one. An analysis of research, including the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism, also supports this approach, and autism societies in other countries also caution against relying on just one method. By enabling children in special classes to have access to a range of methods, including ABA, the Government is doing what we are advised is in the best interests of such children.The use of ABA as part of the range of interventions is particularly useful for addressing behavioural issues. The Department of Education and Science therefore supports the use of ABA and training is provided for teachers in its use. However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that it should be the only method used. Whereas ABA helps to improve behaviour, other methods, such as TEACCH and PECS, are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.It is important that children have access to a range of methods so their broader needs can be met. Children in special classes have the benefit of fully-qualified teachers trained in educating and developing children generally and who have access to additional training in autism-specific approaches, including ABA. The level of such training available to teachers has improved dramatically in recent years and is a major priority for the Government.Children in special classes also have the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration into mainstream classes and of interaction with other pupils.In excess of 265 autism-specific classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, while more are being set up all the time. At primary level there are a maximum of six children in each special class with a teacher and at least two special needs assistants. Extra assistants are provided where the children need them.  An individual child can have his or her individual SNA if he or she needs one.Again I reiterate my commitment to ensuring that all children including those with special needs can have access to an education appropriate to their needs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The Higher Education Policy Institute report (2007) references data derived from the Eurostudent Survey of 2005 and from a more detailed survey that took place in England and Wales.   In Ireland the Eurostudent Survey was undertaken by the Higher Education Authority who commissioned the ESRI to manage the survey.The Higher Education Policy Institute report indicates that of the 8 European countries referenced, Ireland has the second shortest duration of study leading to a first degree.  The country with the shortest duration (England and Wales) is only slightly below Ireland. These findings indicate that the implementation of the Bologna process has yet to lead to much reduced programme lengths outside of Ireland and the UK.   It is anticipated that this pattern will change over the coming years with an increasing focus on countries to reduce the length of programmes associated with a first degree.There is no suggestion in the report that the length of study directly correlates with the quality of learning and the quality of the outcomes attained. Nevertheless, the survey does highlight the need to ensure that continuous measures are undertaken within higher education to ensure that the quality of outcomes is maintained and enhanced.  In this regard, the establishment by Ireland of the National Framework of Qualifications is a vital development as are the quality assurance arrangements that underpin Irish higher education.    The Framework is one of the first two National Frameworks in Europe to be formally aligned with the Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area.  It is also noteworthy that all Irish quality assurance agencies will have completed reviews in relation to their compliance with European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance by mid-2008.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	317	While schools are requested to return the information by 31 October each year — 4 weeks after the Census date — in many cases schools do not make a return until much later.  It is not possible to finalise the Primary school database until all schools have been returned.  In recent years, some schools have been outstanding as late as June following the Census.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The Department is aware that there are extensive housing developments and population increases in the greater Dublin area and that this has led to increased demand for school places.Earlier this year, the Department published a Draft Area Development Plan setting out infrastructural requirements for the foreseeable future for the north Dublin, east Meath and south Louth areas. This Plan covers the areas referred to by the Deputy.The Commission on School Accommodation has completed a public consultation process on the Draft Plan and it is the Commission's intention to publish a final plan shortly. When this is published, it will become the framework against which capital investment for the areas concerned will be made for the foreseeable future.The Draft Plan shows that considerable interventions have already been made by the Department to increase pupil places in the areas concerned and that these interventions are being backed up by a significant capital investment programme.To underpin infrastructural requirements, the Government is investing €4.5 billion in school buildings under the National Development Plan to ensure that school places are available where they are needed. This year alone will see construction work to provide over 700 classrooms in new schools and extensions to existing schools — most of these in the developing areas. When complete, these classrooms will provide modern facilities for over 17,500 pupils. The Department expects this level of activity to continue for the foreseeable future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	319	It is generally accepted that our primary school system has served the country very well over the years. Primary schools have always been an important feature in communities and provide a base in which social inclusion is fostered and where the involvement and support of parents and the broader community is well recognised. Since the advent of greatly increased immigration to Ireland, primary schools have played an extremely important role in providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for newcomer children.The very high level of activity on the Schools Building and Modernisation Programme reflects the rapid population increase being experienced here in recent years. The Department is planning to provide sufficient pupil places in all rapidly developing areas, including those areas where there might be large immigrant communities. This year alone will see construction work to provide over 700 classrooms in new schools and extensions to existing schools – most of these in the developing urban areas. When complete, these classrooms will provide modern facilities for over 17,500 pupils. The Department expects the need to provide similar levels of additional accommodation to continue for the foreseeable future.I fully accept that from the perspective of ensuring integration of new communities in the country it is not desirable that children should be educated separately.  Indeed the House will be aware that my Department makes substantial extra provision for schools in respect of language needs of pupils in a large number of schools with children from an immigrant background. In excess of 1,450 language support teachers are currently employed in primary and post primary schools.Other measures have also been taken to assist school in this area. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has also produced intercultural guidelines to support teachers and schools in developing a more inclusive learning environment and in providing students with knowledge and skills they need to participate in a multicultural world. Corresponding guidelines for intercultural education in post-primary schools have also been made available by the NCCA.My Department also provides funding to Integrate Ireland Language Training to provide Language Support Teachers with in-service training to assist them in meeting the English language needs of their pupils/students.In order to assist newcomer parents, information on the Irish Education system has been placed on the Department's Website (www.education.ie) in six languages including Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Russian, Spanish and German. It is intended to include further languages as the need arises.It is not the intention of the Department to establish schools solely for children of a particular ethnic background. However, in a situation where these children were potentially being left without school places, the Department had to act immediately and take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that they were accommodated.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	320	It is a matter for individual schools to determine their enrolment policies. In doing so schools must act in accordance with the requirements of the Education Act and equal status legislation.As the Deputy will be aware, the vast majority of primary schools in this country were established by the Catholic Church.However, they have historically welcomed pupils from all backgrounds and continue to do so. In fact, many Catholic schools would now have large numbers of newcomer children with a diversity of faiths enrolled. My Department is determined to continue to support this practice by ensuring that sufficient school places are available in all areas.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The cost of any site is determined both by the amount of land required to accommodate the size of the school together with the value of land pertaining in the actual location of the proposed school. The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally. In certain circumstances local authorities also acquire sites on behalf of my Department.The use of compulsory purchase procedures can be quite protracted and it would not necessarily mean the faster acquisition of sites. Neither would compulsory purchase orders mean the acquisition of sites at a price below market value. In all cases my Department undertakes a valuations of the sites prior to purchase and acquisitions are pursued on the basis of this valuation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	322	The National Educational Welfare Board is developing a nationwide service on a continuing basis that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that my Department's Estimates for 2007 includes a provision of €9.808 million for the National Educational Welfare Board. This represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level. This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk. Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.An additional 15 staff have been allocated to the NEWB in 2007. This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWO's and 72 EWO's.The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.  Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it. The EWOs also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.Since January 2004, 20,000 cases involving students with reported school attendance difficulties have been resolved by the Board. The NEWB has also issued an Information Leaflet to every family with children of school going age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in relation to education and school attendance and where they can get help.The first national data on school attendance has been collected and is being used to inform the Board's work. In relation to the effectiveness of the service, it is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved by 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year. Attendance data relating to the 2005/06 school year is currently being analysed by the NEWB.It should, however, be remembered that the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school. In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and services such as breakfast clubs and homework clubs. In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies. Access to these services is being increased with the continued rollout of services under DEIS the Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage.This government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education. I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB's staffing under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I am aware of the situation to which the Deputy refers. However, the use of school property not owned by the State is entirely a matter for a Board of Management and the Patron. The only concern for the Department is to ensure that any non-mainstream school usage of the school premises does not impede the delivery of the curriculum.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The total number of teachers teaching in primary schools as at June of this year, was 28,735. 28,117 of that number were qualified primary teachers, a further 175 qualified post-primary teachers but not qualified primary teachers, and 443 were unqualified teachers.Currently there are 3,213 students pursuing Bachelor of Education degrees in the Colleges of Education, approximately one third of which are due to graduate in 2008. There are a further 299 students pursuing the 18 month Post Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary Teaching) in those Colleges. The number of Post Graduate students represents just one cohort of entrants — February 2007. These students are also due to graduate in 2008.  Another cohort will enter in February 2008.There are a further 775 students currently enrolled in 18 month Post Graduate distance learning course with the Hibernia College. 255 of those are due to graduate in summer 2008, 260 in autumn 2008, and 260 in summer 2009.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 412 together.As the Deputies may already be aware, I plan to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students and to consolidate the administration of this unified grants scheme in the VEC sector. This will, I believe, provide for a more coherent administrative system. The scheme, which will be underpinned by a new Student Support Bill, will facilitate consistency of application, improved client accessibility and timely delivery of grants.The Student Support Bill is at an advanced stage of preparation, and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at second-level, mainly in the case of language subjects, decisions on which textbooks to use in first and second-level schools are taken at school level.Syllabus planners are conscious of the need to avoid over-frequent changes to textbooks, primarily in order to minimise increases in the cost burden for parents. However, textbooks have to be changed periodically to enable teachers to keep their own and their students' work educationally stimulating and to ensure that content and methodology are kept up to date.School authorities have been advised that books should be changed only to the extent that is absolutely necessary.My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for pupils from low-income families in schools at first and second-level. Schools are notified of the scheme each year by circular letter.Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases.My Department will provide funding amounting to some €13.8m under the schemes in 2007.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I am aware of the comments made by CORI last week. Funding from my Department for adult literacy has increased dramatically from just €1 million in 1997 to €30 million in 2007. The 2007 allocation represents an increase of €7.4 million, or 21%, on 2006.As a result of this increased expenditure, the number of literacy places has increased from 5,000 in 1997 to over 40,000 in 2006. Following on commitments in the "Towards 2016" Partnership Agreement and in the Programme for Government an extra 7,000 literacy places will be provided in the period 2007-2009. I am providing for 3,000 of these additional places in 2007.The increased financial provision this year also allows for an expansion of the Intensive Tuition in Adult Basic Education Programme, which was launched in 2006. In addition, a family literacy pilot scheme is being developed this autumn to address poor literacy from an intergenerational family perspective.To ensure a multi-pronged approach is adopted my Department has, in partnership with NALA, used the medium of television to reach an even wider audience. The "Read, Write Now" series, from 2000 to 2005, and the more recent "Really Useful Guide to Words and Numbers" in 2006/2007 provided learners with an opportunity to improve their literacy skills from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. Funding for a new series has been made available.There are also a number of schemes funded by my Department which target people with special literacy needs, e.g. deaf people, people with dyslexia and a literacy service in Irish for people in Gaeltacht areas.Adult literacy and numeracy are also an integral component for learners in both the part-time and full-time suite of further education programmes.In addition, there are workplace literacy schemes in operation around the country. A workplace literacy programme, called Return to Learning Scheme, has been introduced in all Local Authority areas for outdoor workers. Under the FÁS/VEC Return to Education Scheme, participants on the Community Employment Scheme, operated by FÁS, can be released from their work experience programmes to avail themselves of intensive literacy tuition provided by the Vocational Education Committees.In 2005, and again in 2006, FÁS spent €2 million on addressing the literacy and numeracy needs of staff in the workplace. An additional €1 million is being provided in 2007, bringing the total funding to €3 million for this scheme.In addition to the wide range of initiatives I have just outlined, a far greater emphasis has been put on improving children's literacy skills in recent years. We are prioritising early intervention so that children's literacy problems do not become entrenched and carry with them into adulthood.Significant progress has therefore been made, and continues to be made, in addressing the needs of both children and adults with low levels of literacy. The Government's targets for the coming years are designed to be both challenging and achievable.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	328	In the State examinations all candidates who attempt an examination in a particular subject are awarded a grade ranging from an A (85% and above) to an NG (less than 10%). In the Leaving Certificate, the A grade is sub-divided into an A1 and A2. Irrespective of the grade obtained, all candidates receive a certificate that records all their grades and no candidate is deemed to have failed any examination.I am broadly satisfied that the Leaving Certificate results obtained in most subjects this year followed a generally similar pattern to those of previous years. The results patterns and variations will be the subject of further comment in the State Examinations Commission (SEC) 2006 Annual Report.Leaving Certificate Maths at all three levels – Foundation, Ordinary and Higher – has seen improvements this year in the proportion of students scoring at Grade A. The EFNG rate at all three levels is marginally higher than in 2006, but still below the levels of 2005.In Leaving Certificate Physics, at Higher level, a greater proportion of students scored at Grade A this year. There was a small increase in the percentage scoring at Grades E, F and NG compared with 2006, but the rate was still below the 2005 rate. At Ordinary level the A rate was down marginally but the overall ABC rate was up; while the EFNG rate was up slightly, it too was below the 2005 value.In Chemistry at Higher level there was a decrease in the proportion scoring at Grade A, but the overall ABC rate was higher than last year; the EFNG rate was lower than in either of the two previous years. At Ordinary level the A rate in Chemistry was higher than last year. The proportion scoring Grades E, F and NG at this level was higher than last year – 16.8% compared with 15.5%. However, it should be noted that, since the cohort is small, these percentages represent quite small numbers of students – just over two hundred in each case.In Leaving Certificate Biology, at Higher level, a greater proportion of students scored at Grade A this year, while there was an increase in the percentage scoring at Grades E, F and NG compared with 2006. At Ordinary level the A rate was somewhat lower while the EFNG rate was up, although it was still below the 2005 value.Overall, these variations are modest and are broadly consistent with the patterns in previous years. While the EFNG rates in Maths and the sciences at Higher level are higher than the corresponding rates in many other subjects it may be noted that the A rates in these subjects also tend to be significantly higher than in most other subjects.The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) has undertaken a review of mathematics provision across second level. A discussion paper was circulated to schools in October 2005 and this was followed by a three-month consultation period. A report of the consultation was published in April 2006. Following on this process the NCCA submitted proposals for a phased revision of the Junior and Leaving Certificate syllabuses in June of this year. I am currently considering the most appropriate approaches to progressing these proposals.With regard to the sciences, revised syllabuses have been introduced in Leaving Certificate Biology, Physics and Chemistry. All of these were examined for the first time in the last five years. A revised syllabus has also been introduced in Junior Certificate Science; the first examination in the revised syllabus was in 2006. This provides for a more investigative approach to science education with some 30 experiments and investigations which have to be carried out over the period of the programme. This hands-on approach is seen as critically important to enhancing the attractiveness of the subject and to encouraging more students to choose the physical sciences at senior cycle. All of these developments are being, or have been, supported by national inservice programmes for teachers. In addition, some €13m was issued to schools in 2004 to provide resource grants to support the implementation of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus.The three Leaving Certificate science subjects are now included in the first phase of the senior cycle review currently being undertaken by the NCCA. This revision of the syllabuses is intended to build on the progress achieved at junior cycle level. To this end the revised syllabuses will be presented in terms of learning outcomes and will have an increased emphasis on science process skills and on an investigative approach to teaching and learning.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 to 166, inclusive, together.The main bodies under the remit of my Department are the National Statistics Board, the National Centre for Partnership and Performance, the National Economic and Social Council and the National Economic and Social Forum.  Details of their respective memberships and recent appointments are attached at Appendix A.  The Law Reform Commission operates under the aegis of my Department and so details of this membership are also included.The National Statistics Board was established on a statutory basis inNovember 1994, under the Statistics Act, 1993. The Board has no paid staff and no budget. Expenses incurred relate to the payment of stipends to five Board members, to the holding of meetings and to the publication of reports.The National Economic and Social Council (NESC), the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP) and the National Economic & Social Development Office have been in operation for various periods of time on a non statutory basis. Under the National Economic and Social Development Act, 2006, the bodies were established on a statutory basis as constituent bodies of the National Economic & Social Development Office (NESDO). The provisions of the Act came into force by order of the Taoiseach, as provided for in the Act, on 1st January, 2007.  Details of staffing levels and budgets for each body are attached at Appendix B.The All Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution was established in 1997. To date, it has been funded by a grant administered by my Department. Members have been appointed by Party Leaders at each change of Government and the secretariat has varied over the past 10 years between 2 and 3 full-time staff at various times. The Budget has risen from £250,000 per annum to approx. €400,000. The Committee is to become a Joint Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the 30th Dáil.In addition, the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership in Dublin was established in 2001 under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and has been under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach since January 2004. It has a membership of 13 and the staff comprises a Director, an Assistant Director and one member of support staff.  Its costings since 2004 are just under €1.2 million.Following on from the work of the Information Society Commission, an eInclusion Stakeholders group was established by my Department in 2006 to continue the work that the ISC were doing.  It has a membership of 28 including representatives of the Social Partners, Government Departments and Agencies, academics and those engaged in the delivery of eInclusion projects and programmes at local and EU level.  The group will monitor progress on a national eInclusion strategy, which addresses those in each lifecycle stage that are digitally excluded.   The secretariat for the group is provided by the Information Society Policy Unit in my Department.The following are the most significant bodies under the remit of my Department which have been abolished:—The first Information Society Commission was established by the Government in May 1997, in response to the Report of Ireland's Information Society Steering Committee: "Information Society Ireland: Strategy for Action".The Commission was an advisory body whose main function was to monitor and advise Government on the development of an Information Society in Ireland.  One of the most important of the Commission's tasks was to raise awareness amongst the general public and industry of the opportunities and benefits offered by the Information Society.  The Commission completed its term of office in December 2000.The Commission had 10 members and 8 secretariat staff.  The budget for the Commission in 2000 was: £560,000 (€711,053).  The Commission had a staff complement of 8 in its final year.The second Information Society Commission (ISC) was appointed by me in November 2001 and completed its term of office on 31 December, 2004.  In its final year there were 20 members of the second ISC and 8 secretariat staff.  The budget for the ISC in 2004 was €700,000.  The ISC was established as an independent advisory body to Government.   It had a key role in shaping the evolving public policy framework for the development of the Information Society in Ireland.   It reported directly to the Taoiseach and drew on high-level representation from the business community, the social partners and the public service.  The membership of the ISC in its final year was 20.The National Millennium Committee was established in 1998 to examine and to make recommendations on projects of national significance to be included in the Government's Millennium Programme.  The Committee's work was done by April 2000, following the commitment by the Government of Committee funds to the recommended projects.  The total amount allocated to the Committee for the Millennium Programme was €30.09 million — all of which was allocated by April 2000.  A small office of four Civil Servants, provided the secretariat to the Committee.  This Office remained in place until June 2002, when it was abolished, to supervise the drawdown of the allocated funds according to agreed drawdown arrangements. The staffing cost of this Office in 2002 was €132,000.  The Board had 13 members at the time of its abolition.The National Centre for Partnership (NCP) ceased to exist in October 2000 and was replaced by the National Centre for Partnership & Performance (NCPP) in 2001.I established the Taskforce on Active Citizenship on 18 April, 2006 to examine the extent to which citizens engage in the issues that affect them and their communities.  There were 20 members of the Taskforce which completed its work in March 2007, when it presented a set of recommendations to Government.  The recommendations were accepted by Government, in principle, and at the launch of the Report on 28 March, 2007, I announced my intention to establish a Steering Group, to be chaired by Mary Davis, to lead the implementation of the Report.  The membership of the Group will be announced in the near future.  The Secretariat to the Taskforce comprised 4 civil servants from the Department of the Taoiseach.  The annual budget for each of the years 2006 and 2007 was €200,000.The Commission of Investigation (Dublin and Monaghan Bombings 1974) completed its work and presented its Final Report to me in March 2007.

They differ from bookmakers in that they facilitate the matching of bets between outside parties unlike a bookmaker who takes the bet and the associated risk involved. Consequently betting exchanges are treated, for tax purposes, as normal companies, and as such are subject to corporation tax on their profits, which in the case of betting exchanges, comes from commissions charged on transactions.  The question of regulating the services of such companies does not arise in tax law.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Commissioners of Public Works are currently sourcing a suitable site in the Swords area for the development of a new Garda Headquarters and a new Court House on the same campus.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 to 171, inclusive, together.One of the measures contained in the Phoenix Park Transportation Study, dated October 2006, relates to the provision of a public bus service to the city, through the Phoenix Park. Arising from this, the OPW entered into discussions with Dublin Bus who responded recently to the effect that in order to make the service feasible, the provision of at least some level of bus lanes would be necessary.The provision of bus lanes is a new proposal and was raised after lodgement of the Planning Application by OPW for renewal of Chesterfield Avenue in July this year.  If it is decided to install bus lanes on Chesterfield Avenue, a Planning Application for such work would be required.The OPW has also been in discussions with Dublin Bus in relation to the provision of a Shuttle Bus service in the Phoenix Park, another measure contained in the Transportation Study and intends to seek expressions of interest in this regard shortly.The introduction of a one way traffic system at Chapelizod and Islandbridge gates and the closure of Military road to through traffic, for the increased safety of all Park users, was implemented in July this year with the full co-operation of Dublin City Council.  This was another measure contained in the Transportation Study but did not require planning permission. The changes affected traffic movements only and did not involve any alterations to the actual gates, which are protected structures.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Section 17 of the Finance Act 2003 prohibits the repayment of tax outside the four-year period. The documentation including tax deduction certificates relating to the tax years 1999/00, 2000/01 and 2001 received from the taxpayer concerned were outside the time limit for making such claims and therefore the credit unfortunately cannot be refunded.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have no record of receiving a request from the individual for a P21 for 2006. On receipt of the Deputy's query a review was carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and a P21 issued to the individual concerned on 25 September 2007.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	337	The Commissioners of Public Works have no responsibility for maintenance of the river in the area concerned. However, the Office of Public Works is happy to assist with technical advice and guidance in this matter.To this end, Officials from the OPW met with Officials from Mayo Co. Council, together with an elected member of Mayo Co. Council last year and a possible solution was proposed which is still being considered. In the circumstances, the meeting requested by the Deputy would be more appropriate to the Local Authority.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	338	A formal re-opening will take place at Swiss Cottage in March 2008 and the site will be open from mid-March to mid-October.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The position is that the VAT regime and indeed the rating of all goods and services are subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can retain the zero and livestock rating provisions which were in existence on 1 January 1991, we cannot introduce any new ones.  Therefore, it is not possible to apply either a zero or livestock rate to the supply of live poultry.Under Annex III of the VAT Directive, VAT registered hatcheries are liable to VAT at the 13.5 per cent rate on their supplies of live poultry. VAT registered farmers are entitled to claim VAT on their input costs which would include VAT paid on live poultry.In relation to unregistered farmers, the Deputy will be aware that such farmers receive compensation for VAT paid on their inputs through the farmers flat rate addition. The flat-rate scheme is a simplified and practical method of applying value-added tax to farming. It compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for the VAT charged to them on their purchases of goods and services. This is achieved without applying the normal VAT rules on registration and returns. The farmers VAT flat-rate addition for unregistered farmers was increased in my last Budget from 4.8 per cent to 5.2 per cent. In this regard, the Government's position of maintaining the farmers flat rate addition at the appropriate rate has not changed.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	340	Both of the towns mentioned by the Deputy have benefited from designation for tax incentives in the recent past. Youghal was designated for tax incentives under the Seaside Resort Scheme which ran from 1995 to 1999, while Cobh was among the 42 towns and cities that had integrated areas designated for tax relief under the 1999 Urban Renewal Scheme. Cobh still benefits from this designation.Following a major review of various property and area based tax incentive schemes I announced in Budget 2006 that most of the existing reliefs were being terminated subject to certain transitional provisions. These included the Urban Renewal and Town Renewal Schemes.   There are no plans to re-introduce schemes along the lines of those terminated in Budget 2006.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	341	In the Civil Service, for which I am primarily responsible, subject to certain conditions an officer may consider purchasing service where s/he has a potential shortfall in service at the relevant retirement age — in other words the officer may be in a position to make additional provision in order to accrue the maximum 40 years' service required for full superannuation benefits by their retirement age.  Any superannuation benefits already accrued by the officer in other employment (other than Social Welfare benefits) are taken into account when determining the maximum amount of service the officer may purchase.  Any officer wishing to purchase service must apply to his/her Personnel Section.  An officer who is permitted to purchase service may opt to do so either by lump-sum payments or by periodic contributions from salary.In the wider Public Service, it is a matter for each public service body to decide if it wishes to offer a purchase facility to its staff.  As I understand it, most if not all public service bodies offer such a facility based on the scheme applicable in the Civil Service.The AVC schemes operating in the Civil and Public Service are separate from the main pension schemes.  In the Civil Service, they are administered by Trustees nominated by the relevant Union under an approved Trust Deed.  My Department or other relevant employer (e.g. the Department of Education for teachers, individual State bodies, etc.) co-signs the Trust Deed as Principal Employer.  The Trust Deed for each AVC plan makes it clear that the employer's role is primarily a facilitatory one, and that no liability attaches to the Exchequer in relation to the investment and management of the Fund or the payment of benefits under the plan.  AVCs are a private arrangement between the individual and the provider.  An AVC scheme in the Civil or Public Service is no different to an AVC in the private sector in that it is set up under Trust Law, requires Revenue approval and is subject to the same regulatory regime as an AVC in the private sector.  For the purposes of regulation by the Pensions Board (under the Pensions Act) an AVC scheme is classified as a Defined Contribution (DC) scheme.I am aware of recent comments in the media concerning AVC Schemes operating in the public service.  As regards the relative merits of the purchase of service scheme vis-à-vis an AVC scheme, this would be a matter for the officer to consider in the context of his/her own individual circumstances.  If in doubt about the matter, independent advice could be sought by the officer.In relation to the availability of information, detailed information on the purchase of notional service scheme in the Civil Service is available on the Government's website www.cspensions.gov.ie together with some basic information on AVCs.  Furthermore, a letter issued from my Department to all Heads of Departments in December 2006 in which they were advised of the requirements to provide specified pensions information to scheme members under the Occupational Pension Schemes (Disclosure of Information) Regulations [S.I. 301 of 2006], including information on the availability of purchase and AVC arrangements.  They were also advised that the obligations apply to bodies under the aegis of their respective Departments and that they should ensure that those bodies are formally made aware of the disclosure requirements.

The Vendor's Solicitor and the Chief State Solicitor are currently concluding the legal arrangements, as a priority, in order to finalise this transaction.The purchase price will be made public on completion of all legal formalities.  Legal ownership of the site remains with the vendor and transfers to the State on completion of the acquisition.On completion of the acquisition, procurement of the new Garda Station building will commence.  Discussions are underway with An Garda Síochána to determine the best method of procurement in this case.  It is not possible at this early stage to predict when construction will start.  However, it is expected that work on site could commence in 2008.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Intercountry adoption is regulated by the Adoption Acts 1952 — 1998.  The Acts which are most relevant to intercountry adoption are the Adoption Act 1991 and the Adoption Act, 1998.There are a number of statutory procedures regulating intercountry adoption.  For example, for an adoption to be recognised in Ireland, all prospective adoptive parents habitually resident in Ireland must be assessed and obtain a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt.  This requirement applies to all intercountry adoptions, regardless of whether the country of origin of the child is outside the EU jurisdiction or not.  This is one of a number of requirements under the Adoption Act, 1991, including, inter alia, the comparability of the adoption law of the country of origin of the child and Irish law.  The Adoption Board produces a number of booklets for prospective adoptive parents which explain the processes relating to assessment and adoption in detail.All procedures are in line with international best practice.  The Deputy may wish to note that the current system of intercountry adoption is currently being examined in the context of the forthcoming Adoption (Hague Convention, Adoption Authority and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2007 which is being drafted.  The Bill will give the force of law to the Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption (Hague Convention 1993).

These will provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke's.  However, I intend to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Over 120,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the number of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals employed in the public health services.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement.  In that regard, it is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of the Actual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  The Executive is the appropriate body to consider the matter raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued to the Deputy.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	352	As the Deputy may be aware, an additional sum of €75m for revenue purposes was provided to the Health Service Executive for Disability Services in the 2007 Budget.  This sum incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism.The Deputy's question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal social services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG/McCann Fitzgerald.The HSE has indicated that the scheme is progressing as speedily as possible and every effort is being made to make repayments.  The HSE has indicated that the delays in making repayments under the scheme have been due to legal and technical issues.  Firstly, over 13,400 estates who lodged claims to date had not extracted a grant of representation in respect of the estate of the deceased patient.  In these instances the person entitled to extract the grant of representation has to be identified before an application can be processed and to date over 6,500 certificates of entitlement permitting individuals to apply for a repayment have issued.  Secondly, there has been a high incidence of claimants providing insufficient information and these claims have taken longer to process as the scheme administrator must be provided with certain information in order to ensure that the correct person and correct amount is repaid. Thirdly, it has been necessary for the scheme administrator to visit over 330 HSE facilities to scan records which form the basis for the calculation of repayments.  The format in which this information is held varies widely between institutions and usually includes a mixture of paper files, handwritten files and computer files.In an effort to address some of the issues mentioned above, the HSE and the scheme administrator are currently conducting an intensive national roadshow campaign throughout the country.  The project is part of the ongoing promotion of the scheme and is also aimed at meeting existing applicants directly to resolve form deficiencies.  Open days have been held over the past 6 weeks in Dublin, Dundalk, Waterford, Cork, Galway and Limerick.  Further open days will take place in Sligo, Athlone and the Cavan Monaghan area in the coming weeks.  These events have been widely promoted through advertising and public relations campaigns on local radio and regional media. The open days have been well attended and have resulted in positive progress in resolving deficiencies and progressing applications.The closing date for receipt of applications is 31st December 2007 and the HSE has indicated that final repayments should be made by mid 2008.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons  who were wrongly charged  for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.Persons who were in publicly contracted beds in private nursing homes are covered by the terms of the Supreme Court judgment.  The provisions of the judgment do not apply to individuals in private nursing homes who have entered these homes under the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme.  In the case of private nursing home care the contract is between the individual and the private nursing home owner.

I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million to the National Cancer Screening Service for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.I have also made available an additional €26.7m capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of seven additional mobile units and state of the art digital equipment.  The static units at University College Hospital Galway and the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork are due to be completed in late Autumn and BreastCheck has confirmed that the roll-out will commence in October.  The BreastCheck clinical unit in the Western Area at University College Hospital Galway will have three associated mobile units.  BreastCheck has already commenced screening in the West, with the provision last May of a mobile unit at Roscommon County Hospital.Screening in individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck's management and operational considerations.  The Deputy's specific questions in relation to operating costs of mobile units, numbers of patients screened in each month, location over the periods in question and detailed phasing and timelines are the responsibility of the National Cancer Screening Service.  Accordingly, my Department  has requested the Chief Executive Officer of the Service to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the matters raised.

This new oral health strategy will be undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the HSE. The development of a new strategy will allow a critical examination of the many challenges and issues currently facing the dental sector, including orthodontic services.In regard to the Deputy's question in relation to waiting times to improve orthodontic services, the position is that the new Programme of Government contains a commitment that orthodontic cases can be referred to the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) by creating an orthodontic fund to treat children who have been waiting the longest for treatment. Officials from my Department will examine the steps involved in advancing this issue while also having discussions with the National Treatment Purchase Fund.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 and regulations made thereunder regulate and control the import, export, production, supply and possession of a range of named narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the Schedules to the Act.  Substances are scheduled under the Act in accordance with the Department's obligations under international conventions and/or where there is evidence that the substances are causing significant harm to public health in Ireland.  The Act also limits packaging and labelling of controlled drugs.  Herbal ecstasy is a term used to describe a combination of herbs which are marketed as a ‘natural high' and which are not scheduled substances under Misuse of Drugs legislation.  The list of scheduled substances is kept under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular, the Department reviews any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.  For example, last year the law surrounding psychotropic (magic) mushrooms in their raw state was clarified in the light of evidence of increased availability and significant harm being done and it is now an offence to sell or possess magic mushrooms.  There are no plans to add herbal ecstasy to the list of scheduled substances.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The General Mortality Register, the main source of information on drug-related deaths prior to the establishment of the National Drug Related Deaths Index in 2005, shows that the number of cocaine-only deaths was two in 2002, one in 2003 and nine in 2004, which is the latest year for which data are available.  The statistics in the General Mortality Register are collected by the Central Statistics Office which measures — as it is required to do — direct drug-related deaths based on an international classification system.  It does not have a reliable measure of deaths which are indirectly related to drug use and so does not provide the full picture of drug-related deaths.  For example, a death resulting from an infectious disease contracted through drug use may not feature in the General Mortality Register as drug-related.  To remedy these limitations, the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform jointly asked the Health Research Board to establish a National Drug-Related Deaths Index.  This index was established to comply with Action 67 of ‘Building on Experience: National Drug Strategy 2001-2008'.  The index is a census of drug and alcohol-related deaths and deaths among substance users in Ireland which is one of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction's key indicators to measure the consequences of the drug situation.  The data for the index is drawn from a number of sources including the General Mortality Register; the Coroner's Service; the Hospital Inpatient Inquiry; and the Central Treatment List.A committee that is co-chaired by the two aforementioned Departments, provides general and technical advice on the development of the index.  Retrospective work done to date on the index indicates that there were 14 cocaine-related deaths in 2002 compared to seven in 2001 and five in each of 1998, 1999 and 2000.  Of the 14 deaths in 2002, 12 were of known drug users and 11 involved more than one drug.  Eleven of those who died were living in the Dublin area.  According to incomplete data for 2003, there were four cocaine-related deaths in that year, although data collection is Dublin has not yet been completed.  The data presented above from the National Drug Related Deaths Index includes statistics from the coroner's service on "sudden and unexpected deaths with positive drug toxicology or a history of drug dependency".  This data is extracted from closed coroner files.  Files may not be closed for a period of time due to a number of reasons such as awaiting toxicology results, pathology results, Garda reports and delay in criminal court proceedings.  These processes must be complete before an inquest is held and the file closed.  For example, for some deaths which occurred in 2003 the inquest was held in 2005.  This indicates that there may be up to a two-year delay before the cause of death is ascertained and the file is closed.

The national roll-out of the Programme is planned for January 2008.  The Service is planning to have cervical screening managed as a national call/recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call/recall, smear taking, laboratories, colposcopy and treatment services will be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated national service.  Accordingly, the Service is not planning to roll out the programme incrementally on a regional basis.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 to 236, inclusive, together.I am committed to ensuring that the BreastCheck service is rolled out to the remaining regions as quickly as possible.  I have allocated additional revenue funding of €8 million to the National Cancer Screening Service for this year to meet the additional costs involved.  The full complement of 111 staff for roll-out has been approved.  I have also made available an additional €26.7 million capital funding for the construction of two new clinical units and the provision of seven additional mobile units and state-of-the-art digital equipment.  The static units at University College Hospital, Galway and the South Infirmary Victoria Hospital in Cork are due to be completed in late Autumn and BreastCheck has confirmed that the roll-out will commence in October.  As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck has already commenced screening in the West, with the provision last May of a mobile unit at Roscommon County Hospital.  The BreastCheck clinical unit in the Western Area at University College Hospital, Galway will have three associated mobile units.  Screening in individual counties will be dictated by BreastCheck's management and operational considerations.The expert advice from BreastCheck and the National Cancer Forum, as contained in the National Strategy for Cancer Control, is that following the national extension of the current programme, the upper age limit should be extended to women aged 69.  As the priority of BreastCheck is to screen women who have not yet been screened, it is fully focused on the commencement of the first round of screening in the West and South.  I will consider extending the age limit as recommended when the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered.  Any woman irrespective of her age who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.  The Deputy's specific questions about the operation of mobile units, the number of patients screened in Roscommon and detailed phasing and timelines are the responsibility of the National Cancer Screening Service.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Chief Executive Officer of the Service to respond directly to the Deputy about these matters.

Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the Health Service Executive as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility to health services under either category 1 (medical card holders) or category 2 (limited eligibility).  While people in category 2 are liable for a charge for attendance at accident and emergency departments, people in both categories are entitled to outpatient public hospital services including consultant services free of charge.  Therefore, when a person with either full or limited eligibility attends a GP and is then referred for public hospital outpatient services, including diagnostic tests, those services are provided without charge.  Work is under way in my Department on a new legislative framework to provide for clear statutory provisions on eligibility and entitlement for health and personal social services, including appropriate charging mechanisms.  The aim is to produce a clear set of statutory provisions that ensure equity and transparency and to bring the system up to date with developments in service delivery and technology that have occurred since the Health Act 1970.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 and 247 together.My Department and the HSE have been reviewing the pharmaceutical supply chain, with a view to seeking value for money in the State's drugs bill in order to better fund existing and innovative therapies without compromising continuity of supply or patient safety.  An HSE-led negotiating team, including officials from my Department, engaged with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) and the Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of Ireland (APMI), representing the proprietary and generic supplier representative bodies, and completed new agreements with these bodies in mid-2006.  These agreements are in place.As wholesale margins are not addressed in the new IPHA and APMI Agreements, it was intended to negotiate direct formal arrangements with the wholesale sector.  Following completion of the manufacturer agreements and in line with the process agreed by the Cabinet Committee on Health, the negotiating team entered talks with the wholesaler representative body, the Pharmaceutical Distributor's Federation (PDF).Early in discussions, PDF refused to negotiate a new margin for community supply, based on its own legal advice that this was a contractual matter between individual wholesalers and retailers. Subsequent legal advice to the HSE, confirmed by legal advice to my Department, indicated that, under section 4 of the 2002 Competition Act, PDF as an association of undertakings may not collectively negotiate fees, prices or margins on behalf of its members. Given the fact that the Irish Pharmaceutical Union is also an association of undertakings, it is not possible for the State to negotiate with PDF or the IPU on fees or margins as such negotiations would place these bodies at risk of prosecution.In light of the legal position arising from the wholesaler legal advice, the negotiating team re-considered how best to address the review of pharmaceutical supply.  Based on the legal advice, a consultation process accompanied by independent economic analysis was considered the most appropriate means to allow for the determination of new reimbursement arrangements.  Following the completion of this process, and informed by independent economic analysis, new reimbursement arrangements were announced by the HSE on 17th September 2007.In its examination of the issues involved, the negotiating team considered a reimbursement level that reflects the market value of pharmaceutical wholesale services, and security and continuity of supply at current levels to patients.  The evidence on which the decision is based, following examination of the issues, direct consultation and independent economic analysis, all indicates that the State is currently paying a premium for the services in question.  It is possible and necessary for revised arrangements to be put in place without a substantial impact on the delivery of such services.Information available to the negotiating team indicates that small and rural pharmacies typically receive discounts of 2-3% on the existing wholesale margin, while larger urban pharmacies and chains typically receive discounts of up to 12%.  Therefore, smaller and rural pharmacies would be proportionately less affected by the revised arrangements.  I would point out that pharmacists provide services under the medical card scheme under the terms of a contract agreed with the HSE. In the light of the legal advice received, and following consultation with the IPU, a separate procedure was also agreed to examine available options for advancing contractual negotiations in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.  This process is being chaired by Mr Bill Shipsey, SC.  This process is continuing.

This amount incorporates the 2007 element of the Government's multi-annual investment programme for the National Disability Strategy.  This Strategy is committed to enhancing, the level and range of multi-disciplinary support services to adults and children with an intellectual, physical and sensory disability and those with autism, including Therapy Services.

Approximately  €1 billion will be spent on mental health services in 2007 which includes an additional €51 million which was allocated in 2006 and 2007 for the development of mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change".  This is one third of the total cost of €150 million estimated by the Expert Group to fully implement the mental health strategy over 7 years.  Future funding will be considered in the context of the estimates process for 2008 and subsequent year.The proportion of overall health spending on mental health is frequently used to make a point on the adequacy of funding.  However, it is not entirely valid to make this comparison, as the nature and scope of health services change, funding ratios automatically change."A Vision for Change" recommended there should be flexibility regarding catchment area size and composition, taking inter alia deprivation into account in catchment areas for populations of between 250,000 and 400,000.  Organisation and management of services within each catchment should be coordinated locally by Mental Health Catchment Area Management Teams and managed nationally by the HSE.In 2006, the HSE developed a population based allocation model for allocating additional mental health funding to areas of greatest need and this model was further developed this year.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.

The Child Care (Pre-School Services) Regulations 1996 and (Amendment) Regulations 1997, which were introduced to give effect to this provision, were replaced with effect from 3 September 2007 by the revised and improved Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006.  The Regulations apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, crèches, childminders looking after more than three children and other similar services which cater for children under six years of age.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for implementing the Regulations and services are required to notify to the Pre-School Services Inspectorate.  In addition to an advisory role in assisting pre-school services to comply with the Statutory requirements, the Inspectorate also carries out annual inspections of pre-school services to ensure that they comply with the regulatory standards.  With the coming into effect of the revised 2006 Regulations, new arrangements have also been put in place by the HSE to meet the commitment given to standardisation of the inspection process and to making the outcome of inspections publicly available.  It is considered that the increased transparency of the new system will provide further protection for parents and their children.  In addition, a Working Group on Standards has been set up under the Office of the Minister for Children and will examine a best practice approach to developing qualitative standards to assist the inspection process as well as the more general advisory role of the Inspectorate.

Subject to the necessary further feasibility, commercial and regulatory work, it also presents a unique opportunity to provide significant additional port capacity in a prime location on the east coast. It is intended to develop the new facility in a number of phases. The actual capacity of the first phase will be determined by the joint venture partners in the light of the further work referred to above which has yet to be carried out.Amendment of the Harbours Act 1996 will be necessary to enable the joint venture to proceed.  More generally, the existing legislation is more than ten years old and requires updating. My Department has made substantial progress in preparing the Heads of a new Harbours Bill to further support implementation of ports policy and to update existing legislation. I propose to seek early Government approval for the drafting of the Bill and I intend to pursue its enactment as quickly as possible.I believe the Bremore project will help to promote competition while relieving congestion at Dublin Port. I think it is also important to reiterate that this proposal is being advanced as a stand-alone project and is not dependent or linked to any relocation of capacity from Dublin Port.

Dublin City Council is the local authority for Dublin City and, as the Deputy indicates, my Department has responsibility for national ports policy.  Last week, Dublin City Council launched an 8 week public consultation period on its Dublin Bay Study, ending 30 November 2007. That looks at a wide range of economic, amenity, recreational and environmental issues linked to Dublin Bay, including the port area.In a submission to the consultants carrying out the study, my Department pointed out that Dublin Port currently handles the vast majority of the trade for the Greater Dublin Area and beyond and as such is of vital strategic importance to the economy. Some 79% of the State's RoRo trade and some 62% of the LoLo trade was handled at Dublin Port in 2006. The National Spatial Strategy identifies strategic merit in relieving pressure on Dublin through targeted interventions in building up port capacity elsewhere.The National Development Plan indicates that the Government will undertake a comprehensive study of the role of Dublin Port, taking account of locational considerations, in the context of overall ports policy on the island of Ireland, wider transport policy, urban development policy, the National Spatial Strategy and national economic policy.  Dublin City Council has indicated that their Dublin Bay study is aimed at launching a public debate. The Council will submit the findings of their report and any public submissions they receive thereon to my Department for consideration as part of the NDP study. Preparations for this study will be initiated in the near future. I have no proposals for a task force on Dublin Bay.

This report was delivered to the Department in June 2006.  Seven ports made detailed submissions regarding their proposals for increasing unitised capacity. In October 2006, the Department published an Information Paper outlining the broad conclusions of the study, which is available on the Department's website www.transport.ie. My Department is continuing to actively monitor the capacity situation. I am encouraged by the fact that the ports continue to make significant progress with their proposals.

When the question of introducing such an arrangement on the Waterford-Dublin route was raised in 1993, I understand that the E.U. Commission refused to sanction the proposal because the route is relatively short and because Waterford was already adequately served by other transport modes.  In the interim, the relevant surface transport links have been upgraded and continue to be improved.  In the circumstances, I have no proposals to revive the question of including the airport in the Irish PSO air service programme.The Government's decision in February 2007 to allocate almost €86 million for capital investment at the regional airports included a substantial allocation for projects at Waterford Airport.  In addition to improving operational safety, the new infrastructure is intended to make a major contribution to the airport's efforts to develop additional services operating on a commercial basis to a number of destinations.

In the case of Dublin Bus in particular, the 142 service is using the Tunnel and my Department is open to authorising additional services through the Tunnel, given the benefits it offers.  However, where a proposed bus service through the Tunnel is likely to conflict with a prior application for a similar service, my Department follows its normal Departmental procedures and this is the case in relation to the Route 41X where my Department considered that the proposal from Dublin Bus conflicted with a prior application from a private operator for services on or along the route in question.On the 22nd March, 2007, Dublin Bus notified my Department of its proposal to re-route four of its existing Route 41X services from Swords via the Port Tunnel. At that time, my Department advised the Company that the proposal was in conflict with a prior application from a private operator for a high frequency bus service from Swords via the Port Tunnel to the City Centre.  Therefore, in accordance with normal Departmental procedures, Dublin Bus was advised that a decision on its proposal was being deferred until the prior application was finalised. Dublin Bus is aware of these procedures.Consideration of the prior application has been completed. My Department is in contact with the applicant and it is expected that the licence will issue shortly.  It is a condition of all licences that the services authorised must be in operation in their entirety within four months from the date of issue of the licence.

Work is now well underway by the Railway Procurement Agency on the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement and the documentation required to support an application to An Bord Pleanala for a Railway Order (the legal permission needed to build and operate Metro North).Metro North will run underground from St. Stephen's Green to north of Ballymun before continuing on above ground to south of Dublin Airport. Here it will move underground beneath Dublin Airport before continuing above ground via Swords to Lissenhall. It will have underground stops at St. Stephen's Green, O'Connell Bridge, Parnell Square, Mater, Drumcondra, Griffith Avenue, Dublin City University, Ballymun and Dublin Airport. It will have above ground stops at Santry Demesne, Metropark, Fosterstown, Swords, Seatown and Lissenhall.  RPA are currently engaged in ongoing consultation with residents and other stakeholders related to design options for Metro North along its entire route.On 13th September 2007 the RPA announced the outcome of the first stage of the procurement process for Metro North.  This involved the selection of those candidates who have been prequalified for the tender stage of the project.  In all, 14 candidates have passed the pre-qualifying stage – 4 infrastructure providers, 5 rolling stock providers and 5 operators.  Qualified candidates have until 2 November to form bidding groups and the tender documentation will be issued to those groups by the RPA early in 2008.  The RPA now expect to commence construction work on Metro North in 2009, subject to having an enforceable Railway Order in place.

Following a detailed public consultation exercise which involved the consideration of two possible route options, the Board of the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) chose a preferred route alignment for Metro West which was announced on 5th July last. The Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) is progressing this project, which is on target for completion in 2014.While Transport 21 involves a very large commitment of financial resources, those resources are also finite.  It has therefore been necessary to prioritise the investments to be made over the ten year period.  There is no financial provision in Transport 21 for the construction of a spur from Metro West to serve the areas mentioned in the Deputy's question. However, Transport 21 does include provision for a spur off the Maynooth suburban rail line to Navan.  The first phase of this project will be to construct a twin track railway line from Clonsilla Station to the planned M3 Interchange at Pace linking into the city centre at the new Docklands Station. Two new stations are proposed along the route at Dunboyne and a major Park and Ride facility at Pace. Provision is also being made for a third station at Hansfield, which is to be developed as a Strategic Development Zone.The route will be convenient for commuters from the Tyrrelstown, Damastown and Clonee/ Ongar areas, with ample parking spaces to be provided at all sites, particularly the Pace/M3 Interchange site.

The new Programme, administered by Pobal, is building on the success of the former Rural Transport Initiative (2000-2006) by putting that pilot initiative on a permanent mainstreamed basis with significantly increased funding with the objectives of expanding existing services and extending the scheme geographically.Some Euro 9 million has been provided for the Programme in 2007. This is in line with the undertaking in Towards 2016, the Social Partnership Agreement, to steadily increase annual funding for the RTP over a period to some four times the 2005 level of Euro 4.5 million. In support of this undertaking, the National Development Plan 2007-2013, Transforming Ireland, commits some Euro 90 million to the Rural Transport Programme over its full term.I am satisfied that the individual Rural Transport groups working with Pobal and supported by funding at this level will deliver on the Programme for Government as far as rural transport is concerned.

It comprises a programme of projects that will greatly improve our national roads and public transport systems over the ten year period to 2015, at a cost of €34 billion.  It will provide integrated, safe and accessible transport networks that will improve the quality of life of all our citizens.I consider it essential that the general public and all interested parties are made aware of the proposals in Transport 21 and are kept up-to-date on the progress being made.  To help in achieving this objective, my Department has developed an information and communications strategy and now proposes to engage the requisite skills, resources and experience to assist in the implementation of the strategy, by creating a high-level of public awareness and understanding of Transport 21.The funding for this information and communications programme will be determined in the overall context of my Department's Estimates provision for 2008.

This new line will be approximately 15 km in length and is expected to add some 25 million extra passengers per annum to the Luas network.  The expected journey time from Lucan to the city centre is about 42 minutes.Two main route options, together with a number of local sub-options, have so far been identified by the RPA.  The public, and indeed all interested parties, have now been asked to submit their views and comments to the RPA on the route which this new Luas line should take.The first route option identified by the RPA runs from Lucan Village to Trinity College via Ballyowen Park, Liffey Valley, Cherry Orchard, Ballyfermot, Inchicore, James's Hospital and Christchurch.  The second option runs from Newcastle Road in Lucan to St. Stephen's Green via Castle Riada, Collinstown Park, Park West, Drimnagh, Rialto, The Coombe and Kevin Street.I am delighted to see that the RPA is maintaining the momentum on the suite of Luas and Metro projects under Transport 21 which will, when completed, serve to ease congestion, increase accessibility and improve the public travel experience throughout the Greater Dublin Area.

They have been reiterated in a national statement by Ireland at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 27 September.We have expressed our full solidarity with the people of Burma and our admiration for the courageous monks, nuns and other citizens who are exercising their right to free speech and free assembly.  The violent response of the Burmese authorities, which has now resulted in numerous deaths, hundreds injured, and which threatens to plunge Burma into chaos, is utterly unacceptable and reprehensible.The Burmese regime must immediately end its violence and repression of protesters.  It must also, at long last, engage in a meaningful process of dialogue to bring about democratisation and national reconciliation.  I repeat the call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all political prisoners, including all those detained over the course of the recent protests.I intend to highlight the issue in my address today to the United Nations General Assembly, and in a meeting with Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon.  I welcome the consultations that have taken place in the Security Council, under French chairmanship, but regret the fact that it has not yet been possible for the Security Council to consider the matter formally.  The Burmese regime must engage constructively with the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy, Dr Ibrahim Gambari, and I welcome the fact that Dr Gambari has been able to visit the country over the weekend, and to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders.  I hope that Burmese authorities will take this opportunity to cooperate with this good offices mission, and to respond positively and actively. I also met with the Chairperson and representatives of Burma Action Ireland on 28 September, which among other things allowed me to hear the views of Burmese in exile.It is vitally important that the international community maintain pressure for positive change by the Burmese authorities at this time.  I have appealed strongly and directly to the Foreign Ministers of China and India to use their influence in this regard and it would appear that the Chinese authorities, in particular, are conscious of their responsibilities.  I welcome China's diplomacy behind the scenes, and in particular its role in facilitating Burmese cooperation with Dr Gambari.  I will also be discussing the issue tomorrow in Washington with the US Secretary of State.The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) also has an important role to play in convincing the Burmese government to respect the basic human rights of its own people.  In this regard, I very much welcome the unprecedented statement delivered by the Chairman in Office of ASEAN in New York on 27 September 2007, which expressed ASEAN members' revulsion at the use of violent force by the Burmese authorities, and called for utmost restraint and renewed efforts towards a peaceful transition to democracy in Burma/Myanmar.  I also highlighted the issue in a meeting yesterday with the Indonesian Foreign Minister in New York.Our Ambassadors in the region have made demarches to a number of Foreign Ministries seeking the cooperation of their governments in bringing pressure to bear on the regime in Burma.  Senior officials in my Department have delivered similar messages to Ambassadors from the region based in Dublin.Ireland and our EU partners apply a range of sanctions and restrictive measures to Burma, referred to as the EU Common Position.  In a statement of 25 September 2007, the EU underlined to the Burmese authorities that it would not hesitate to reinforce and strengthen the existing sanctions regime, should violence be used against the unarmed and peaceful demonstrators.  Now that this has occurred, options for an extension of sanctions are under urgent consideration.  It would clearly be important that these be targeted against the régime, and not cause further suffering to the people of Burma.Ireland will continue to work with all partners, including within the EU and UN, and with those countries which wield influence with the Burmese regime, to encourage positive change in Burma.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I continue to be gravely concerned at the ongoing deterioration in the situation in Zimbabwe.  The hardship and deprivations being experienced by ordinary Zimbabweans are an affront to values which Europe and Africa share.  The dire situation gives added urgency to the efforts being made by President Mbeki and SADC to broker a political accommodation between the parties and an economic rescue plan which will respond to the catastrophic current situation.  We support President Mbeki's efforts in this regard.  I believe that Zimbabwe's neighbours are best placed to keep up the necessary pressure on President Mugabe's government to alter the failed policies which have brought economic collapse and misery to its people.Ireland supports and looks forward to the EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon from 8-9 December 2007.  I believe that this Summit will be timely and important for strengthening Europe's overall relationship with Africa and reaffirming our tradition of mutual engagement.  The EU and Africa share an interest in working together to tackle the full spectrum of global challenges, including achieving the Millennium Development Goals, peace and security, human rights, migration, the environment, energy and trade.  There are also specific country situations on which we share common concerns.  The preparation of a Joint EU-Africa Strategy which will be adopted at the Lisbon Summit this December gives us an opportunity to define together how we can co-operate on these issues going forward.The EU and the African Union will have to work together to find a formula for Zimbabwe's representation at the Lisbon Summit.  The question of how the situation in Zimbabwe might be addressed at the Summit is also under consideration.Ireland believes that it would be better if President Mugabe did not attend the Summit, and we have urged the Portuguese Presidency to explore creatively all other options for Zimbabwean representation.  For example, at EU-ASEAN Summits, Burma/Myanmar has been represented by its Foreign Minister.  However, I am aware that many African countries feel strongly on this issue.  Likewise, many EU Member States do not wish the EU's relations with an entire continent to be held hostage to one country's problems.  Invitations to the EU-Africa Summit have not yet been issued, and until all avenues have been explored it would be premature to comment further on how the issue will unfold.Partnership with Africa is a priority for the Government and a focus of Ireland's foreign policy.  This, as well as our deep concern about the situation in Zimbabwe, will be fully weighed when the time comes to decide whether to attend the Summit.

Much of that controversy arose from fears at the time that jurisdiction over Rockall and similar rocks and skerries was thought to be central in supporting claims to the mineral rights in the adjacent seabed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.However, during the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea, which took place from 1973 to 1982, the Irish delegation worked hard to establish a satisfactory legal regime applicable to islands.  This effort was completely successful.  The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at Montego Bay at the conclusion of the Conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121, paragraph 3 that: "Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf."Rockall is such a rock and Article 121 (3) applies to it.  Ireland ratified the Convention on 21 June 1996.  The United Kingdom acceded to the Convention on 25 July 1997.  It is accordingly accepted by both states that Rockall cannot be used as a basis for delimiting their respective continental shelves or fisheries zones.  Each country remains aware of the position of the other.Rockall was not therefore a factor in the subsequent negotiations between Ireland and the UK on delimitation of the continental shelf between the two countries which concluded in agreement in 1988.  The UK also later withdrew its claim to a 200 nautical mile exclusive fisheries zone measured from Rockall when it acceded to the Law of the Sea Convention in 1997.In a wider context, Iceland and Denmark (on behalf of the Faeroe Islands) both make claims to the continental shelf that overlaps that area in the North East Atlantic in respect of which Ireland and the UK reached agreement in 1988.  The four countries have met regularly since 2002 in an effort to resolve the issues arising from overlapping claims, most recently last week in Reykjavik.  Further talks in this ongoing process are planned.  The issue of ownership of the rock of Rockall has been of no significance in these discussions.

For example, the number of visits abroad in 2006 was almost 7 million.  The vast majority of these visits are trouble free, but unfortunately, some result in death or serious injury.  The number of fatalities varies from year to year, and to date in 2007, assistance has been sought from the Department in over 100 such cases.  In many of these cases, deaths have occurred in very traumatic and difficult situations.  The Department does not breakdown the fatalities by causes of death as those are often in dispute.I am very pleased, however, to report that in the overwhelming number of cases, citizens indicate that they are extremely appreciative of the quality of the support and advice they receive from the Department and our missions overseas in these, often tragic, circumstances.

This was a major disappointment and a setback for the thousands of undocumented Irish people in the United States, and also for their families in Ireland.  It is now widely considered that this important issue is unlikely to be back before Congress in a meaningful way in advance of the next US Presidential and Congressional Elections.In the aftermath of this disappointment, I made clear my determination to actively review the situation and to explore possible alternative options, including bilateral arrangements.  In the months since the collapse of the comprehensive reform bill, my Department and the Embassy in Washington have initiated contacts at senior official level in Washington and have been engaged in a wide range of consultations with Congressional, Administration and Irish community figures to assess how best to proceed.I am availing of my visit to the United States this week to re-enforce these efforts at senior political level through discussions with members of the Administration and Congress, including Secretary of State Rice, Senators Kennedy, Leahy, Schumer and Graham and with the Friends of Ireland in Congress.  I will also have talks with representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and direct contact with the undocumented Irish community in New York.

In the case referred to by the Deputy, the applicant needed to acquire a Foreign Birth Registration (FBR) certificate.  An FBR certificate is required in all cases where an applicant wishes to claim citizenship through a grandparent.I understand that a certificate has now been issued by the Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.  As a result, the applicant should now make a formal application for a passport which will be processed speedily once the application and supporting documentation are received.

The principal expenditure of the Advisory Board relates to commissioning research.YearBoard MembersNo. of StaffBudget€200211365,7272003113608,6322004114950,25720051641,008,11920061641,062,88420071641,200,000The Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) was appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee.  Its purpose is to advise the Minister, Minister of State and Irish Aid on policy regarding development education.  It initially had 12 members but was expanded in 2005 to a 16 member committee.  As an advisory body, the administration of DEAC is serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Department's overall budget.The Díon Advisory Committee was set up in response to concern about the situation of Irish emigrants in Britain in 1984.  The Committee advises the Government and makes recommendations on Emigrant Services funding to voluntary organisations that work with vulnerable Irish people resident in Britain.  In February 2003, the Emigrant Services allocation (known as the Díon committee) was transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  There are 8 members of the Committee.  The administration of the Committee is provided by our Embassy in London and financed within the Department's overall budget.The Ireland — United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission) finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America.  The Fulbright Commission has eight members and enjoys autonomy of management and administration in accordance with the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991.  From 1997 until 2000 the Grant-in-Aid given to the Commission was £100,000 annually.  In 2001 the annual Grant-in-Aid figure was increased to €254,000 per annum and has remained at this level since then.The Hunger Task Force was recently established, in line with the recommendation of the White Paper on Overseas Development Assistance, to identify t he contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger.  The Task Force has been appointed for a period of six months, after which it will present a final report to the Minister of State with responsibility for Overseas Development.  The Task Force has 16 members and had its first meeting on 14 September 2007.  Its administration is serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs and it has no distinct budget.The following organisations have been abolished or replaced by other bodies.The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) was in existence between 1993 and 2002.  Its purpose was to provide advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries.  In 2002, the year it was replaced (as stated above) by the Advisory Board for Irish Aid, the IAAC had 14 Committee members, one member of staff and a budget of €507,895.The Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO) was established by the Government in March 1974 to promote and sponsor temporary service in the developing countries of the world.  The activities of APSO were formally integrated into the Development Cooperation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs on 1 January 2004.  In 2003, the year of abolition, the Board of Directors of APSO consisted of eleven members, with nineteen staff and a budget of €22,890,636.The National Committee for Development Education (NCDE) was established in 1994 to promote development education throughout all sectors.  It was abolished at the end of December 2002 following the recommendations of the 2002 Ireland Aid Review Committee.  In 2002, the year of abolition, there were 13 appointed members of the Committee, a budget of € 2,708,375 and 6 staff members who were transferred to the new Development Education Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs.The Irish Refugee Agency was created in 1991 to assist with the integration of Vietnamese refugees in Ireland and it subsequently assisted with Bosnian and Kosovar refugees.  In 2001, following the recommendations in the report of the Interdepartmental Group on the Integration of Refugees in Ireland , the Government decided to replace the existing structures for dealing with refugees (including the Refugee Agency) with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In 2001, the year of abolition, the Irish Refugee Agency had 13 board members.  The Agency had a budgetary allocation of £150,000 for January-April 2001 and six staff members who were integrated integration into the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The Cultural Relations Committee (CRC) was established in 1949 under the aegis of the then Department of External Affairs and was transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in 2002.  The Grant-in-Aid administered by the Committee for 2002 was €672,000.  The role and function of the CRC was to advise the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the administration of the annual Grant-in-Aid voted by the Oireachtas for the development of cultural relations with other countries.  There were 22 members of the Committee, with an increase to 25 members in 2002.  Its administration was serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs.

They are:The Advisory Board for Development Cooperation Ireland (formerly the Advisory Board Ireland Aid);The Development Education Advisory Committee;The Board of the Ireland – United States Commission for Educational Exchange (Fulbright Commission); andThe Díon Committee, which advises on support for our emigrant communities in Britain.I have made no new appointments to these bodies since 1 July 2007.

While the opening of new Embassies abroad is considered by the Government on an ongoing basis, any expansion of our diplomatic network can only be undertaken having regard to clear priorities.The White Paper on Irish Aid, published in September 2006, designated Malawi as Ireland's ninth programme country.  In February of this year, the Government approved my proposal to seek the agreement of the Government of Malawi to the opening of an Irish Embassy in Lilongwe.  This agreement has now been received and our first resident Ambassador to Malawi will take up duty shortly.The successful trade mission, led by the Taoiseach in January, to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates underlined the potential value to Ireland of having a second resident Embassy in the Gulf region.  Accordingly, and in order to take advantage of this potential, the Government in March agreed to my recommendation that an Embassy be established in the United Arab Emirates.  The timing of the establishment of this new embassy in Abu Dhabi will be considered at an early date.Apart from Malawi and the United Arab Emirates, there are no plans at present to establish any other new Embassies.

As a member of the Government delegation at Stormont on that occasion, I had the opportunity to meet with the First and Deputy First Ministers and the new Ministers in the Executive.Since restoration of the Assembly and Executive on 8 May, the North-South and East-West institutions established under the Agreement have been working well and with full participation by the Northern Ireland Executive.I accompanied the Taoiseach to the ninth Summit meeting (and the first since devolved government was restored in Northern Ireland) of the British-Irish Council in Belfast on 16 July.  First Minister Paisley and Deputy First Minister Mc Guinness, together with relevant ministerial colleagues, represented the Northern Ireland Executive.  The Summit was a positive, business-like and constructive event.  We had a very useful discussion on strategic transport and agreed to examine the potential for further cooperation and collaboration in relation to transport planning and investment.  Recognising the potential of the BIC to strengthen relations between its members and to develop cooperation further between them across a range of sectors of mutual interest and benefit, the Council agreed it is now opportune to review the future direction of the BIC.The following day, I participated in the Plenary meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in Armagh.  The Taoiseach led a delegation of Government Ministers to meet with the First Minister, Ian Paisley, the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, and Ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive.We had an open discussion on many issues of common interest, North and South, including economic challenges, and considered how we might work together for our mutual benefit.The Council took a number of important decisions.  We agreed two major infrastructure projects: an investment of €580 million /£400 million to upgrade the road in the North serving Derry and Letterkenny; and the restoration of the Ulster Canal from Clones to Lough Erne.Upgrading the road to Derry and Letterkenny to dual-carriageway status will bring significant benefits for people living throughout the North West.  Restoring the Ulster Canal will give a major boost to tourism and economic development in the border areas of Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh.We also discussed other potential infrastructure projects, including the Irish Government commitment to support the development of a bridge at Narrow Water linking Carlingford with Warrenpoint and enhancing tourist links between County Louth and County Down.We agreed at the Plenary to take forward the review, provided for in the St. Andrews Agreement, of the North/South Implementation Bodies and Areas for Co-operation.  The review will report back to the first NSMC Summit in 2008.The Council also agreed a busy schedule of NSMC sectoral meetings to take place through the autumn.  The first such meeting took place earlier this month, on 14 September, when the Minister for Transport met with his Northern counterpart in the NSMC transport sector.I am planning to meet with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister in the Institutional format of the NSMC before the end of the year.I am also looking forward to participating in the next NSMC Plenary meeting, which will be held in Dundalk later this year.  In addition a further Summit meeting will be hosted by the Government in the course of 2008.Since restoration engagement with the Northern Ireland Executive has been extremely positive.  The Government is committed to working with the new Executive and political representatives in Northern Ireland to address the many issues of mutual concern in a spirit of partnership and friendship.  I look forward to continued productive engagement and cooperation with Northern colleagues in the period ahead.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.In April 2000 limits were introduced on the amount of time that a person could participate on CE (3-years total time on CE from 3rd April 2000 – participation on CE before this date is disregarded).  CE capping was introduced to facilitate the movement of participants through the programme, allowing new participants who may not otherwise have such an opportunity, avail of the programme.Thereafter, to cater for older workers in particular, in November 2004 I revised the 3 year CE capping to allow those of 55 years of age and over to avail of a 6-year period on CE (again based on participation since 3rd April 2000).  Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment (including those under 55) was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.  Currently there are over 6,000 people over 55 years of age on CE.  This represents circa 29% of those on CE, a figure which has increased from 25% at year end 2005.Notwithstanding this enhanced access for those which fall into the over 55 age group, there is a wide range of other client groups which must also be given access to the opportunity CE provides e.g. Lone Parents, persons with disabilities, stabilised substance abusers and unemployed persons aged under 55.  In the delivery of places locally, FÁS is obliged to balance the needs of all groups in terms of access to Community Employment.CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.It should also be noted that persons may wish to avail of FÁS\Local Employment Service Offices which provide information on other employment and training opportunities which may be available to those in local communities exiting or ineligible for Community Employment Schemes.

Neither my Department nor the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government nor the local authorities have guidelines on the question of the release of retained firefighters to carry out their fire fighting duties.  However, I further understand that there is an onus on retained fire fighters to obtain permission from their other employer to secure release to carry out their fire fighting duties.If retained fire fighters cannot obtain that permission and if they are in dispute with their other employer on this issue, it is open to them to refer the matter to the Labour Relations Commission for resolution of the dispute.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.In line with Government policy, participation on employment schemes has an upper age limit of 65 years of age i.e. FÁS may provide funds to community based employers to cover participant costs until the day before their 66th birthday.CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.

In formulating the new arrangements, my priority was to ensure that they are responsive to the needs of our dynamic labour market and are supportive of continued economic growth and competitiveness.I will be keeping the operation of all the employment permit schemes under review to ensure that they continue to adapt to the changing needs of the economy and the employment market.  Where necessary we will adapt and change their format and operation as the economy and employment market continues to develop.

Responsibility for grant assistance to companies locating in the Region is an operational matter for the relevant development agencies. IDA Ireland is the national agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions (incl. Co. Limerick), while Enterprise Ireland is responsible for indigenous industry in the Mid-West region. Both Shannon Development and IDA Ireland work closely together in the development, promotion and marketing of tailored property solutions throughout the Mid West which includes the Askeaton Business Park.The Business Park is a Shannon Development-owned land bank, comprising  228 acres situated on the southern bank of the Shannon Estuary.  The site has been identified as an important site from a business and employment perspective for both Co. Limerick and the wider Region in the Planning and Land Use Transportation Study, the Mid-West Regional Planning Guidelines and the Limerick County Development Plan.  The typical investment projects which both Shannon Development and IDA Ireland seek to win are in advanced higher-value manufacturing and services activities (often containing an R&D element) requiring high-level skills, infrastructure and advanced business services.  This reflects the changing nature of modern FDI projects whose primary needs can be summarised as follows: a high-quality serviced environment within proximity of a critical population mass capable of providing a skilled workforce, world-class access infrastructure (e.g. road access to key cities, sea ports and international airports), telecommunications infrastructure with multiple broadband carriers and proximity to third level educational institutions including universities and technical colleges.The Askeaton Business Park is considered to be nationally significant given its location on the deep-water estuary, proximity to Foynes and Limerick Ports, proximity to urban clusters in Limerick City and Askeaton, railhead access on the Foynes-Limerick route and its site boundary with the N69 providing direct access to southern ports such as Cork and Rosslare. The completion of the Southern Ring Road and the proposed Limerick Tunnel will furthermore enable direct road access to Shannon Airport for passenger and freight services and will facilitate access to the West and East Coasts including Dublin Port.The development and servicing of the Askeaton Business Park as a solution for these large scale infrastructure intensive type projects is an ongoing project for Shannon Development, drawing on the experience of IDA in the development of similar such sites in other locations, e.g. Oranmore, Co. Galway and Grangecastle, Co. Dublin.  In this context Shannon Development is working closely with IDA Ireland on the development of Strategic Sites in the Shannon Region.The Askeaton Business Park is marketed through IDA Ireland's network of overseas offices as a location for international export-orientated projects. Ultimately, however, decisions regarding where to locate a project are taken by investors based on a variety of criteria and on the capability of any particular location to support their business needs.

The Arts Council's funding requirement for the year ahead will be addressed in the context of the 2008 Estimates.  In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.Funding for the Arts Council has increased from €47.67 million in 2002 to €80 million in 2007 — an increase of almost 68%.  These are significant amounts of money in any context.  This funding has transformed the arts, increasing access to and participation in the arts, and has provided an excellent platform for future development.My policy on the arts is to promote and strengthen the arts in all its forms, increase access to and participation in the arts and make the arts an integral and valued part of our national life.The table below shows the funding provided to the Arts Council between 1997 and 2007.YearFunding% ChangeSupplementary EstimateTotal  including Supplementary€m199726.4126.41199833.1425.533.14199935.557.335.55200045.0826.845.08200146.372.91.7748.14200247.672.847.67200344.1-7.544.10200452.519.02.0054.5020056116.25.2366.23200672.3118.510.0082.31200780.010.680.00

Significant progress has been made to date by all the agencies in preparation for the Beijing Olympics and Paralympic Games and planning is well underway for the final twelve months in the lead up to the Games in 2008.The Olympic and Paralympic Councils of Ireland are the agencies responsible for the organisation and participation of the Irish teams at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The Irish Sports Council provides annual funding to both Councils for administration and programme costs aimed specifically at preparation for the Games.  In 2007, the Council allocated total funding of €556,000 to the OCI and €479,000 to the PCI to support their operational costs and Beijing preparation programmes. In the final twelve months to Beijing, the OCI and PCI have responsibility for a number of areas including: team manager training programmes, preparation visits to Beijing by key personnel, heat and acclimatisation strategy, the organisation of multi-sport camps and holding camps in advance of the Games.Arising from the Sydney Review 2001 and the Athens Review 2005, the Irish Sports Council has introduced many initiatives and programmes to enhance the preparations of Ireland's Olympic and Paralympic athletes.  These include: the introduction of structured performance planning with the National Governing Bodies, the introduction of professional coaching and management structures within the sports with the appointment of full-time performance personnel, the review and subsequent revision of the International Carding Scheme, the establishment of the Irish Institute of Sport which has a brief to drive excellence in the development of high performance sport and support services for athletes, the introduction of professional administrative and support structures in the Olympic and Paralympic Councils of Ireland and the establishment of Olympic and Paralympic Performance Committees to ensure optimum cooperation in the preparation and performance of Irish teams.Since 2004, the Irish Sports Council has allocated a total of €18.6m in high performance funding to 13 focus Olympic and Paralympic sports for performance plans and International Carding Scheme payments.  The 13 focus sports in receipt of high performance funding are: Athletics, Boxing, Rowing, Sailing, Equestrian, Canoeing, Cycling, Hockey, Shooting, Swimming, Tennis, Badminton and Paralympic Sport (includes Wheelchair Sport, Cerebral Palsy Sport and Blind Sport).Funding for the high performance programmes will continue in 2008 with a clear focus on qualification for and participation in the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Beijing.

Under the present ACCESS Scheme, 156 applications were received by the closing date of November 2006. In April 2007, 67 of these were selected for funding.  Applications for grant aid of €213m in total were received.  The amount of funding available was €32m and, as a result difficult decisions had to be made and many worthwhile projects, including this one, were not selected on this occasion.All the funds under the current round of the scheme have now been fully allocated.  Funding of some €81m is available for ACCESS under the NDP 2007 — 2013 and I would expect a further round of funding to be announced in due course.I am fully aware of the importance of this project to people living in the Monaghan and border areas.  My officials will be meeting shortly with representatives from the Monaghan project to discuss the project in greater detail.  The application has been kept open and will be reconsidered should further funds become available or should one of the successful projects not go ahead.

Expenditure up to the end of August 2007 was €262 million. Total expenditure in 2007 will be of the order of €400 millionThe supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support, in the form of a weekly or monthly payment, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplements are subject to a means test.  They are normally calculated to ensure that, after payment of rent, an eligible person has income equal to the rate of basic supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.Many recipients pay more than €13 because recipients are also required to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.Year€000199795,6101998111,7401999128,2402000150,5902001179,4382002252,3402003331,4702004353,7602005368,7052006388,3392007*262,255* End Aug 2007
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The household benefits package, which comprises the electricity/gas allowance, telephone allowance and free television licence schemes, is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over, who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition.  The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments such as disability allowance.Those aged under 70 must live alone or only with certain excepted people in order to qualify. Excepted people for the purposes of the scheme include qualified adults, dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full time education, people who are so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months, people who would qualify for the allowance in their own right, people who are providing constant care and attention to any member of the household who is so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months.Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefit package or free travel retain that entitlement.  This measure is in place to ensure that households who have this entitlement do not lose it on the death of a spouse.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Under the terms of the free travel scheme, certain incapacitated people can qualify for a free travel companion pass if they are medically assessed as unfit to travel alone.  Where the applicant is under 70 years they must submit a medical certificate completed by their general practitioner providing details of their incapacity.The application for a companion pass by the person concerned was refused, following a review by the Departments Chief Medical Assessor, on medical grounds.  She was informed of this decision in June 2007 and was advised that further medical evidence in support of her application could be forwarded to the Department.  The person concerned is already in receipt of a pass which allows her to travel with her spouse/partner.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.The primary objective of the carer's allowance is to provide income support to low income carers. Carer's allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested. This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.The carer's allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  The means test has been significantly eased over the years most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of €640 per week. This ensures a couple can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.In addition, the rates of carer's allowance have been increased to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.The complete abolition of the means test would have substantial cost implications and it is debatable whether this could be considered to be the best use of resources.  The view of some support and health organisations is that it would be much more beneficial to carers if additional resources were invested in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The back to education allowance (BTEA) facilitates people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  The scheme enables qualified people who have been getting a social welfare payment to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course.To qualify for participation, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment and must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  A person must have been in receipt of a social welfare payment for at least six months (156 days) for a second level option course and 12 months (312 days) for a third level option course immediately prior to commencing an approved course of study.The person concerned does not satisfy the eligibility criteria for participation in the scheme as he has been unemployed for less than the minimum period specified.The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and this is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need.The objective of the scheme is to help long-term unemployed social welfare recipients, by way of education and training to improve their prospects of acquiring sustainable employment.  My Department is committed to encouraging those who have been out of the active work force to avail of appropriate pre-employment training, development and education opportunities.  People who are already in employment or only a short time unemployed are not in the target group for the BTEA scheme.

Under the terms of the scheme, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost, such as a rent deposit, which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment.  Each application is determined by the Executive based on the particular circumstances of the case.The Health Service Executive has advised that it has not received an application for payment of a rent deposit from the person concerned. If the person concerned wishes to make an application for payment of a rent deposit, she should contact the community welfare officer in her area so that her entitlement can be assessed.

The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.  Lone parents or couples may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare payment or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.The income limits for the BSCFA take account of household size and are increased each year.

The National Action Plan for Social Inclusion (NAPinclusion) 2007-2016 and the social inclusion commitments in the National Development Plan were drawn up in consultation with the social partners and after a wide-ranging consultation process with other stakeholders. The NAPinclusion adopts a lifecycle stage approach, in line with Towards 2016 with specific measurable goals set for each group: children; people of working age; older people and people with disabilities and their communities.The overall goal in the NAPinclusion is to reduce the number of those experiencing consistent poverty from 7 per cent of the population to between 2 per cent and 4 per cent by 2012, with the aim of eliminating consistent poverty by 2016.The plan sets out a wide-ranging and comprehensive programme of actions over the period to achieve the overall consistent poverty goal and to ensure that every person has access to income and resources (material, cultural and social) that are regarded as acceptable by Irish society.Ending child poverty is a particular priority in the NAPinclusion. Four of the twelve high level goals in the NAPinclusion focus on education initiatives and adequate income supports for children. Detailed action targets cover health, education, income support, early childhood development and care and participation to ensure that children reach their true potential.The social welfare commitments in the Programme for Government prioritise the objectives of the NAPinclusion. They include: improvements in the State Pension and the Carers Allowance; more support for lone parents; and improvements in Child Benefit and in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and the School Meals Programme. Support for the Office for Social Inclusion is a key commitment, in particular, for its work to progress the use of poverty impact assessments by government departments, local authorities and statutory agencies in the development of policies and programmes to ensure that the Government's social inclusion agenda is achieved.My plans, in working with Government to deliver the programme over the coming years, are to build on the significant and visible progress that has been made in reducing poverty in the past 10 years and to deliver real improvements in living standards and well being for the most vulnerable in our society.

These activities included, for example, measures to deal with compromised on-farm animal welfare, research, the payment of ex-gratia monies to assist organisations involved in the direct delivery of animal welfare services as well as costs associated with the implementation of the Control of Horses Act.In addition to the above, Veterinary Inspectors of my Department in their normal day-to-day duties perform a significant amount of animal welfare-related work, the cost of which while considerable would be very difficult to quantify in monetary terms.Other funding measures coming within the welfare funding remit of my Department include the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council which promotes and addresses issues of animal welfare in a practical manner and which has made a significant contribution to addressing important welfare issues.

There is no confirmatory test and thus no provision in legislation for such a test.  Indeed, Article 17 of the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order 1989, (S.I. No. 308 of 1989), as amended, provides that, where an animal has given a positive result to a test, it shall not be tested again with tuberculin.  While Directive 64/432/EEC provides that Member States may also authorize the use of other approved tests such as the gamma-interferon assay as a supplementary test in infected herds for the purposes of identifying and removing additional infected animals, any animal which reacts positively to the skin test is deemed to be a reactor.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The issues referred to are now regulated under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1226/2002 which replaced Annex B to Directive 64/432/EEC in its entirety and thus superseded any previous amendments to that Annex, including those provided for in Council Directive 80/219/EEC. The conduct of the intradermal comparative test is governed by Directive 64/432/EEC, the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order 1989 (S.I. No. 308 of 1989) and the legally binding contract (ER4 document) the Minister has with each private veterinary practitioner (PVP) testing under the programme.  Each testing PVP signs the conditions contained in the ER4 document on an annual basis and this includes the requirement to clip and cleanse the sites prior to injection.  There is also a quality control programme in place that ensures that all testing PVPs comply with the conditions of their contract.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	488	As indicated in my reply to Questions 39881/06 and 39882/06 on 23 November 2006, the holding relating to the herdnumber referred was restricted in October 2005 because of the repeated failure of the herdowner to have the herd tested for TB and Brucellosis as required by EU and national legislation.The herd was eventually tested on 3 January 2007 for Brucellosis and on 6 January 2007 for Bovine Tuberculosis. All animals were reported as having passed these tests.  However, in view of the fact that the herd had been restricted since October 2005, under EU legislation a further test is needed before the herd can be de-restricted. Unfortunately, the testing veterinarian was not aware of this and signed and returned a number of animals' passports to the herdowner. The DVO wrote to the herdowner reminding him that his herd remained under restriction and advising him that an Authorised Officer would call to his premises under Article 12(3) of the Bovine Tuberculosis (Attestation of the State and General Provisions) Order 1989 to collect all cattle passports in his possession. However, the herdowner failed to surrender the cattle identity cards.The DVO has been in touch with the herdowner on several occasions to carry the second test but to date the herdowner has failed to co-operate in this matter. When this test has been carried out with negative results for these two diseases, his herd will be de-restricted.The Deputy should be aware that the herdowner in question has presented his herd for testing only once in the past 3 years in spite of on-going efforts by the DVO to have the herd tested.  This behaviour increases the risk of the spread of disease and is most unfair to his neighbours who have had their herds tested annually. The matter is also the subject of legal proceedings.

This checklist has been reviewed as part of the full review my Department carried out on the inspection arrangements for the Single Payment Scheme with a view to simplification of the arrangements (including paperwork) where possible while, at the same time, ensuring compliance with the regulatory requirements.The inspection checklist has been made available to the farming organisations and is also freely available on my Department's website at www.agriculture.gov.ie under the heading ‘Cross-compliance'. The review of the checklist together with the outcome of the Commission's review of the cross-compliance arrangements generally, has been fully discussed with the farming organisations in advance of the commencement of the inspections for 2007.In addition, my Department recently published a leaflet entitled "What to expect if you are selected for an inspection under the Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas' Compensatory Allowance Scheme" a copy of which was posted to every herd owner in the country.   That leaflet is also available on my Department's website.

The areas specifically identified were animal and plant health.  Subsequently the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) agreed that there should be formal co-operation in the following sectors of agriculture: the development of an All-Island Animal Health Strategy for control of animal movements and the prevention, containment and eradication of epizootic diseases in Ireland; the development of an All-Island Plant Health and Research Strategy including co-operation between both jurisdictions in relation to plant protection products; and liaison on issues arising at WTO, EU enlargement and the mid-term review of the CAP.Co-operation in the development of an all-island animal health and welfare strategy has progressed through the NSMC and by a number of working groups which continued to meet during the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly.In recognition of the commonalities of needs and priorities in both parts of the island in terms of implementation of EU Common Agricultural Policy, both Departments continue to cooperate closely on the implementation of CAP reforms.  This process involves regular information exchanges, co-ordination of actions, where appropriate and looking ahead to emerging changes to EU rules and to emerging EU policies to develop complementary policy negotiating strategies.I will be discussing these areas and other topics of interest when I meet with Ministers Gildernew and Foster at the Agriculture Sectoral meeting on 9th November.

Primary legislation was enacted by the Oireachtas last year, which extended the compulsory country of origin labelling requirement for beef to the catering sector. The information which must be given on the label includes the registered number of the slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of the country of origin.The general EU food labelling regulations covering all food sold in Ireland require that the information be given clearly, accurately and in a language understood by the consumer.  Among these requirements is origin marking in cases where failure to provide such information would be likely to mislead the consumer to a material degree.  This legislation comes under the remit of the Department of Health and Children.

Within a couple of days the European Commission adopted a Commission Decision which banned the export from Britain of those animals and products which had been included in my earlier ban.That original Commission Decision has since been discussed and revised on a number of occasions at meetings of the European Commission's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH), whose meetings are always attended by officials from my Department.  In addition, officials from my Department are in regular contact with Commission colleagues in relation to various aspects associated with animal disease outbreaks, including the recent FMD outbreak.Furthermore, the FMD outbreak was raised by the UK delegation and reviewed at last week's meeting of the Agriculture Council, which I attended.  The Deputy can be assured that my officials and I are fully engaged with the European Commission and the Council of Agriculture Ministers in relation to any EU initiatives relating to the FMD outbreak in Britain.

In 2006, the person named did not continue to farm at least 50% of the lands he declared in the reference period so his application to consolidate his entitlements was refused.  However, he has now agreed to voluntarily give up some of his single payment entitlements in order to satisfy the 50% rule.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Responsibility for enforcement of labelling legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) through its service contracts with my Department, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, the Health Services Executive, the Local Authorities and the National Consumer Agency.  In relation to the particular issue of country of origin labelling, compulsory beef labelling legislation incorporating the origin of this meat has been in place since September 2000.  I have already collaborated with the Minister for Health & Children and introduced legislation to ensure that all beef sold or served in the retail or catering sector is now required to carry an indication of the country of origin.  This legislation is enforced by the FSAI.  Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level.  The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.In relation to other meats I have signalled my intention to have legislation brought forward to require the country of origin to be shown on poultry meat, pigmeat and sheep meat sold in the retail and catering sectors.  A draft of such regulations was prepared by my Department and is currently being finalized by the Department of Health & Children.  A public consultation process is currently being conducted.  Following consideration of any views received it will be necessary to submit the draft regulations to the European Commission for approval.  The EU Commission is currently reviewing the whole area of food labelling and in that context my Department contributed to Ireland's submission which was co-ordinated by the Department of Health & Children.  Within this submission Ireland explained why it felt that origin labelling should be compulsory for all meat.  As well as direct contact with the Commission on this I have also raised this matter in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council and I will continue to press for progress as I believe consumers are entitled to full information on the origin of food products.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The area devoted to energy crops has increased to meet the growing demand for biomass feedstocks.  The area of oilseed rape, which is used to produce liquid biofuel, increased from 5,000 hectares in 2006 to 7,500 hectares in 2007.  In addition, almost 800 hectares of willow and miscanthus were planted in 2007 following the introduction of establishment grants under the new Bioenergy Scheme.  The developing Bioenergy market and attractive grants on offer are encouraging farmers to plant more land with energy crops.  As set out in Budget 2007, €14 million is being made available over the period 2007-2009 to incentivise farmers to grow energy crops.  The funding includes €6 million to support a new energy crop premium of €80 per hectare.  The €80 premium will be paid, subject to certain conditions, as a top-up to the existing EU premium of €45 per hectare available under the EU Energy Crops Scheme.  A further €8 million is being made available to provide establishment grants to farmers interested in planting willow and miscanthus.The future outlook for energy crops depends on a number of factors, not least profitability at farm level.  In general, the production of energy crops will have to be demand led and will only occur if the economic returns are greater than those offered by more traditional outlets.  In the short-term, the soaring world demand for grain is likely to lead to an increase in the area devoted to conventional cereal crops in Ireland and elsewhere in response to the current high grain prices.  More long-term projections are difficult to forecast at this stage.  Much will depend on the rate of development of production and consumption patterns for biofuels over the next number of years.  To stimulate demand for biofuels, the Government is providing over €200 million in excise relief and plans to introduce a new ‘biofuel obligation' to ensure that biofuels represent 5.75% of Ireland's transport fuel market by 2009 and 10% by 2020.  The European Commission recently adopted a new binding target of 10% for the amount of biofuels used in transport fuel by 2020.  These measures should provide the long-term market certainty required to allow the biofuel industry develop to sufficient scale in Ireland and in turn create market opportunities for locally produced feedstock.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	502	Our exports of agri-food products have grown steadily in recent years to reach record levels of over €8bn in 2006.  These exports are now increasingly concentrated in the high-value EU market. Our future success will to some extent be determined by the level of competition on our main markets and this will be affected by any new WTO deal.  However, our ability to compete will also be affected by the actions we take to ensure that our agri-food sector is a highly competitive producer of the goods demanded by European and other consumers.The Agrivision 2015 Action Plan which I published in March 2006 sets out my vision for a competitive, consumer-focused and knowledge driven agri-food sector which will contribute to a vibrant rural economy, society and environment and which exploits opportunities in non-food areas.  In addition to a broad vision statement, the Plan sets out one hundred and sixty six specific actions to be implemented for the development of the sector.  It was drawn up in the light of recent CAP reforms and the likelihood of a more liberalised trade policy under a new WTO agreement but also against the background of other changes which will impact on the sector such as lifestyle changes, the emergence of technology and Research and Development as market drivers and structural changes in the farming and the retail sector.  I believe the measures provided for in the Agri-Vision 2015 Action Plan in conjunction with the provisions of the 2003 CAP reforms will facilitate the continued growth of Irish Agri-Food exports and ensure that Irish agri-food exports are competitive on world markets.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	503	Under the Government's decision, the percentage of the EU restructuring aid to be reserved for beet growers and machinery contractors was set at 32.38% (€47.1m).  Of this 27.50% (€40m of the €47.1m) was for beet growers and the balance for machinery contractors.  The balance of the aid (€98m) was allocated to Greencore.  The High Court ruled, in effect, that these percentages would have to be recalculated.  Last week, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council reached political agreement on an amendment to the restructuring aid Regulation, one effect of which is to increase the allocation to Irish beet growers from €40m to €52.8m.  The allocation to the processor would also increase but the final allocation for the processor depends on the outcome of the legal proceedings.  Separately, growers will receive up to €120m in compensation through the Single Farm Payments Scheme in the period up to 2013 and €44m, in Diversification aid from the Restructuring Fund.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	504	Prior to the introduction of the temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community, sugar beet was grown for sugar processing in all but four Member States, namely Cyprus, Estonia, Luxembourg, and Malta.  In the first two years of the restructuring scheme, which involves quota renunciation and closure of the associated processing facilities, restructuring applications were submitted in 12 Member States. Details of these applications are given, by Member State, in the table below.  Last week, the Council of Agriculture Ministers reached political agreement on a proposal to make the restructuring scheme more attractive with a view to reducing the EU sugar quota by a further 3.8m tonnes.  The effect that this will have on sugar beet production in individual Member States remains to be seen.Member State(1)

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I propose to take Questions Nos. 377, 378 and 382 together.Conditions for trade in animal products with third countries follow the principles established under agreements of World Trade Organisation and the International Organisation for Animal Health.  The European Commission is mandated to negotiate these on behalf of the European Community and, through its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), to monitor compliance in those third countries it has approved for trade with the EU.  This approval is on the basis that the Commission adjudges the third country's controls offer an equivalent level of guarantee for the protection animal and human health to those being operated in the Community.  Where there are risks to the public or animal health in the Community from disease outbreaks occurring in approved third countries Safeguard Measures are invoked restricting or banning imports from the affected country or region until the risk has been eliminated.Consignments of animal products for food purposes must be imported and processed through a EU approved Border Inspection Post (BIP) where documentary, identity and physical examination of the consignments are undertaken in accordance with EU requirements.  The FVO also audits the operation of BIPs in the Member States.  I have consistently pointed out at EU level that produce imported from third countries must meet standards equivalent to those required of Community producers.  In this context I have been in regular contact with EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection Mr. Markos Kyprianou.  The Commissioner has assured me that the Commission will not hesitate to take the appropriate protection measures if a product, imported from a third country or produced in the domestic market represents a risk for the health of EC consumers, livestock or plants.  I should add that in WTO discussions in the Council, I have always emphasized the need to take account of the non-trade aspect of market access, which I regard as a crucial element in the overall negotiations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	506	My Department and I have been particularly proactive in taking measures designed to minimise the risk of the introduction to Ireland of either Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) or Bluetongue.With regard to the threat of FMD, I introduced an immediate ban on the importation to Ireland from Great Britain of live susceptible animals, fresh meat, raw milk and other products from such animals as soon as the first case of FMD was confirmed in Surrey on 3 August.  I also instructed the immediate installation of disinfection points at Irish ports and airports.  My Department also published information leaflets for people travelling from Britain and published information notices in the national newspapers as well as providing advice to the organisers of agricultural shows.  Furthermore, my Department set-up a dedicated FMD website which contains a significant amount of useful information and advice.  Within days of the introduction of my ban on imports from Britain, the European Commission introduced a ban on the export from Britain of susceptible live animals and products, including those included in my earlier ban.  The Commission Decision was strictly enforced by my Department and a subsequent Commission Decision, introduced in the immediate aftermath of the first case in the second cluster of cases on 12 September, is currently being enforced by my Department.  In the short period during which live exports from Britain were permitted, there were three consignments of live animals imported from Britain and all have been traced and clinically examined and found not to have any signs of disease.With regard to Bluetongue, my Department and I have responded proactively to the increased threat posed by the spread of the disease across northern Europe last year by engaging the Department of Zoology at NUI Galway to assist in carrying out a comprehensive surveillance survey of the midges that potentially spread the virus.  In addition, my Department's laboratory service has been testing thousands of blood samples for any evidence of Bluetongue since August 2006.  My Department has also updated its contingency plans and legislative basis and has provided advice leaflets to farmers and the veterinary profession as well as having organised an industry seminar on bluetongue in July and comprehensive information is available on the Department's bluetongue website – www.bluetongue.ie.The more recent detection of the disease in Britain, along with the rapid spread of the disease across northern Europe and its detection at more northerly points than ever before, inevitably increase the threat to Ireland.  On Friday last, the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in Britain confirmed an outbreak of Bluetongue and immediately put in place the control measures required by Council Directive 2000/75/EC. There is, already, as a result of the FMD outbreak in Britain, a ban on the importation from Britain of live animals.  With regard to the threat presented by both Bluetongue and FMD, my approach is to ensure adequate awareness of the diseases and, particularly, the clinical signs with which farmers, veterinary practitioners and other livestock handlers ought to be familiar and to encourage vigilance among them when inspecting animals.  In that regard, farmers and veterinary practitioners should note that Bluetongue is a notifiable disease and suspicions of the disease must be reported immediately to my Department.  My Department and I are very conscious of the need to ensure such adequate awareness and are keeping the communications strategy under constant review.  Secondly, I am satisfied that the control measures currently in place are, at all times, proportionate to the current level of risk.  This is obviously a situation that also requires to be kept under review and I will not hesitate to refine and update those control measures should I be satisfied that the risk has increased and that further control measures are appropriate.In relation to the threat posed by the two diseases, my Department and I have been working closely with the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London, the European Commission in Brussels and, particularly, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) in Belfast.  I have been and continue to be in frequent contact with my Ministerial colleagues in London and Dublin while my officials are in constant contact with their counterparts.  Working closely with DARD to ensure that the island of Ireland remains free of both Bluetongue and FMD is a priority for both Departments.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	507	The 2003 CAP reforms have been very positive for Irish agriculture.  They have provided farmers with certainty about income support levels through the Single Farm Payment, while freeing them to increase their income from the market by responding to consumer demands.  My main concern, now, is to ensure that there is a period of stability to allow farmers to implement the changes necessitated by decoupling and to adapt to the market needs in a stable policy environment.  The 2003 CAP reform is still being implemented and further major policy change should not be contemplated at this stage.The Agrivision 2015 Action Plan which I published in March 2006 sets out my vision for a competitive, consumer-focused and knowledge driven agri-food sector which will contribute to a vibrant rural economy, society and environment and which exploits opportunities in non-food areas.  It was drawn up in the light of recent CAP reforms and the likelihood of a more liberalised trade policy under a new WTO agreement but also against the background of other changes which will impact on the sector.  In relation to the ongoing WTO negotiations my over-riding objective is to ensure that the terms of the final agreement can be accommodated without the need for further reform of the CAP.  I have consistently outlined my position in the clearest possible terms in the Agriculture and Fisheries Council. I will continue to work closely with like-minded Ministers in other Member States to seek support for my position.  I am determined that any WTO agreement must be balanced and must not be concluded at the expense of EU and Irish agriculture.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	508	Ireland is a food trading country.  The industry serves 80 million customers throughout Europe and the world.  This Government's vision for success is focused on the objective of ensuring that the Irish agri-food sector compares to the best in the EU and in the world in terms of knowledge base, competitiveness, innovation and marketing.  My own approach and commitment to the future is based on the Agri Vision 2015 Action Plan, which I launched in 2005.  This sets out the Government's vision for an agri-food sector that is competitive, consumer-focussed, which contributes to a vibrant rural economy, society and environment, and which also exploits opportunities in non-food areas.The Action Plan sets out a wide range of actions that are required of all participants in the agriculture and food sector.  These actions are needed to equip the sector to meet the challenges of a more competitive and liberalised market.  Farmers, the processing industry, researchers, the advisory services, exporters and all those involved in the industry have a role to play in an integrated food chain if we are to achieve the vision that is set out.  As commercial subsidies will play a much-reduced role in the future, success or failure will be determined primarily by the skills and energy of private business of all sizes and at all levels in the sector.  Our vision for the future has been framed in the context of the Lisbon Agenda, which sets the overall EU policy framework for the economic and social regeneration of Europe if it is to remain a leading player in the global economy.  The EU has committed itself to more growth and more jobs and, in particular, to investment in knowledge and innovation in unlocking business potential.  This Government is convinced that the indigenous agriculture and food sector can make a significant contribution to the Lisbon process by retaining employment in rural areas in a modern efficient and competitive farming sector, in high-tech jobs in Research and Development and in the processing industry.Meat SectorTo support the beef sector in responding to the very real challenges it faces on an ongoing basis in a very competitive environment, I have announced a number of policy initiatives and proposals.  Amongst these is the Animal Welfare and Recording Scheme for Suckler Herds, aimed at assisting improvements in both quality and productivity, and thereby further underpinning competitiveness.  Negotiations on finalising the scheme with the Commission, as required under EU law, are ongoing with a view to resolving outstanding issues as rapidly as possible.  In addition, Bord Bia are intensifying their promotional efforts, particularly in our principal European markets.  This will build on the already well-established marketing efforts, which are carried out on an ongoing basis by Bord Bia and the industry itself.  In addition a Market Access Group has been established recently comprising representatives of my Department, An Bord Bia and the industry. Its main aim is to facilitate trade in Irish meat to non-EU markets.  These initiatives are among a series of measures designed to assist and strengthen the beef sector and further position it to face the challenges of the future. Others include the Capital Investment Aid Scheme for the beef and sheepmeat sectors, which is directed towards improving efficiency and competitiveness in processing, expansion of Quality Assurance Schemes, and advances in Breed improvement programmes being progressed by ICBF.Dairy SectorTo date in 2007, the dairy industry has experienced strong demand and prices for all dairy products and the outlook for the remainder of the year looks very positive.  This has had a positive effect on producer prices, which have been increasing in recent months.  Over the next years, intervention and market support measures will diminish in importance and the dairy industry will face internal and external price pressures.  Capital investment and research and development in the industry are priorities in the Agri Vision 2015 Plan of Action.  In this context, I launched a new dairy processing industry investment package in 2006.  The package recognised the critical need for the State to engage with the processing sector in order to achieve the most favourable climate in which it can operate.  The package will also assist the sector in terms of increasing scale and efficiency.  In April 2007, a total of 19 capital investment projects were approved and awarded Government grant assistance of €114 million, which will generate an estimated capital spend of €286 million.  The Dairy Processing Investment Fund will support capital investment related to the processing of dairy products, to underpin competitiveness and viability of the dairy industry in Ireland.There is also a need for improved efficiency and long-term competitiveness at producer level.  Reducing costs and increasing scale means getting more milk quota into the hands of active and committed producers at the lowest possible cost.  I introduced a new Milk Quota Trading Scheme for the 2007/2008 quota year.  I announced the 2008/09 scheme last week and the next quota trading exchange is due to run before the end of the year.  The current Milk Quota regime was extended to 2014/15 as part of the Luxembourg Reform of the CAP in 2003.  A Health Check review was agreed as part of this, but a Council Decision will be required for any proposed changes to the regime.  The review will take place in 2008 and the key issue is the future of milk quotas.  The Commission has already made it clear that it will be proposing the abolition of quotas from 2015, with a phasing out period before then, and will put forward a number of options in Spring 2008.

Children diagnosed with autism are eligible for 10 hours home tuition per week from age 2.5 and the allocation increases to 20 hours per week when they reach 3 years of age.  The child referred to by the Deputy has been allocated a place in an early intervention class for children with autism and may enrol when he is 3 years of age.  In the interim he will be eligible for home tuition as outlined above and I have arranged for home tuition forms to be issued to his parent.

My officials have been in contact with the NCSE in relation to this case and I understand that 3.5 resource teaching hours were granted to the school for the pupil in question in February 2007.  These hours remain in place.  The NCSE has advised that the pupil did not meet the criteria for full time SNA support and this was reduced in September 2007.  The SENO discussed the  decision with the school at the time.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998 requires the Board of Management to publish the policy of the school concerning the admission to and participation in the school.The compulsory school starting age in a National School is 6 years of age.  Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is open to all schools to apply for extra temporary accommodation to meet the immediate need for places at junior infant level or for older children. Such applications are invariably granted but of course schools need to make sure that they apply for extra accommodation in time.  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a Board of Management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended by Section 50 of the Equality Act, 2004).The Board of Management of a school is also obliged under section 19(3) of the Educational Welfare Act 2000 to make a decision in writing in respect of an application for enrolment within 21 days and to inform the parents in writing of that decision. Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act (as amended by Section 4 of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007, to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department.A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.Details on appealing decisions on enrolment under section 29 of the Education Act (as amended by Section 4 of the Education (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2007), are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie

Based on the 2006/2007 enrolments, the school had 108 vacant pupil places.The Department is aware of the extensive housing developments and population increases in Skerries which is leading to an increased demand for school places. Earlier this year, the Department published a Draft Area Development Plan setting out infrastructural requirements for the foreseeable future for the north Dublin, east Meath and south Louth areas which includes Skerries.On foot of this draft plan, the Department is of the view that a new post primary school for circa 600 pupils will be required in Skerries in the coming years.  In that context, a site requires to be reserved which is being pursued under the Fingal School Model Agreement process.  A timeframe for the delivery of a new school will be set when a suitable site has been identified and acquired.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I can confirm that a Major Capital Application for the school to which the Deputy refers is currently being assessed in the context of the Departments Multi-Annual Building and Modernisation Programme and other projects in rapidly developing areas.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Two school sites have been reserved in Skerries for primary education requirements by Fingal County Council. The Department has instructed the County Council to acquire one of the sites, as a matter of priority, for the purpose of providing a new primary school for September 2008 and also permanent accommodation for St. Michael's House Special School. The Department intends to have suitable temporary accommodation in place on this site to enable the commencement of a new primary school for September 2008.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Department has, in the past, had some difficulties obtaining such information from schools who had concerns regarding provisions of the Data Protection Act. In view of this, the Department will issue a circular to schools, clarifying the position and advising schools to draw parents' attention, on the enrolment forms, to the fact that such information may be provided in the context of planning for school provision.However, the Deputy should also note that owing to a high incidence of duality across enrolment lists, together with inward and outward migration, and the practice of accepting multiple school places, access to such enrolment data alone will not fully or adequately inform the Department when planning additional school places.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	525	As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now 5,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children. Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 350 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	526	The Deputy will be aware that my Department implemented a general allocation system of learning support/resource teachers (LS/RT) to mainstream primary schools in September 2005. The system is intended to cater for children with high-incidence special education needs such as borderline mild general learning disability and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and/or mathematics.It is a matter for each school to identify the pupils with learning support and high-incidence special education needs that will receive supplementary teaching support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can use its professional judgement to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. My Department issued a guidance circular to schools which contained detailed information on how the system operates.The learning support resource teaching service is available to all mainstream national schools including gaelscoileanna. Boards of Management are obliged to recruit fully recognised and qualified teachers to LS/RT posts to deliver this service.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I propose to take Questions Nos. 403, 404 and 433 together.The school to which the Deputy refers extended its provision of educational facilities in September 2007 on foot of an extension of the parish boundaries to take in the new developments in Tyrellstown.Due to the restricted nature of the existing school site, the Department agreed that the school could operate on a split campus basis and in that context temporary accommodation was provided.   Educational provision will continue in both locations pending delivery of a permanent school.The Department is in receipt of proposals from the Board of Management of the school in relation to the future development of the school.  In considering these proposals, further information and clarifications have been sought from the school authority. A response is awaited in this regard.  Any decision regarding the future development of the school is a matter ultimately for the Patron body and the Board of Management.  The Department is in the process of acquiring one of the reserved sites in the Tyrellstown area to provide permanent accommodation for this school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	529	In analysing the need for future educational provision in the Hansfield SDZ, the Department, using the 2006 Census figures, takes account of the of the average occupancy rate for Fingal and the national average of school going children as percentage of total population.It was also assumed that demand for educational provision emerging in the area would be met within the Hansfield area as schools in the surrounding area are operating at maximum capacity at present.  As the Deputy may be aware, the reserved site in Hansfield is governed by regulations attaching to the Hansfield SDZ. The schools in Hansfield will be delivered commensurate with the phasing arrangements in the SDZ in a similar manner as those for the Adamstown SDZ.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The Deputy will be aware that the Department is advancing plans to make considerable extra post primary provision available in the Dublin 15 area.  This includes three 1,000 pupils post primary schools to be developed in Phibblestown, Tyrellstown and Hansfield.  With regard to Castleknock specifically, the Department is examining site possibilities for a new post primary school with the local authority.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The Department continually monitors situations regarding demand for  primary and post primary schools in areas where there will be  a suspected shortfall in school places. Officials from School Planning Section are in regular contact with the Planning Department of local authorities and receive regular updates on housing completions, planning applications, potential infill etc.My Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment. As a matter of course meetings are arranged with local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	532	This information is not readily available.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I propose to take Questions Nos. 410 and 425 together.I understand that the Deputy refers to an ownership dispute regarding the boundary between land owned by the Department and adjacent private houses.The Department acquired this land early 2006 and title to it (including the disputed piece) is registered in the Property Registration Authority.  Some months ago, while the school building project on the site was under way, a number of residents in the private houses made a claim to ownership of the strip of land in question.  In order not to delay the school building project while this claim was being examined, my officials immediately instructed the building contractor to proceed to complete the school excluding the disputed portion of land.  The school is now completed.As there is ambiguity as to ownership of the land in question the Department has requested the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to write to the legal representatives of the owners of the adjacent properties in an effort to agree a resolution to the situation. I do not propose to release the site map concerned while the matter is under consideration with the Chief State Solicitor's Office and until a resolution has been agreed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	534	As the Deputy may be aware, the Department works in partnership with Fingal County Council under the Fingal School Model Agreement to acquire sites for educational provision in the Fingal area.  As such, the Department has had no direct negotiations with the company to which the Deputy refers with regard to the acquisition of primary and secondary school sites at Kellystown and Porterstown in Dublin 15.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The Higher Education Grants Schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the Higher Education Grants Scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.  Each Year, the Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the Schemes. The approved institutions mainly comprise of public funded third level institutions.There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges. Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme to include private colleges can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.  Tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, is available on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State.  Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from any tax office.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 and 423 together.The Department does not have the authority to use compulsory purchase orders in relation to matters arising from site acquisitions. The Property Management Section of the Office of Public Works acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally. In certain circumstances local authorities also acquire sites on behalf of my Department.The use of compulsory purchase procedures can be quite protracted and it would not necessarily mean the faster acquisition of sites. Neither would compulsory purchase orders mean the acquisition of sites at a price below market value. Where no alternative course of action exists, my Department may ask that CPOs be used, but the potential for the acquisition time to be quite protracted will be considered.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	545	The acquisition process for the additional land to which the Deputy refers is at an advanced stage. However, the Deputy will appreciate that, due to the commercial sensitivities of land acquisition, I am unable to comment on the detail in relation to specific land purchases.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The Teaching Council has had responsibility for registering teachers since its establishment on 28 March, 2006.  My Department does not have any involvement in this process.When an applicant for registration applies to the Teaching Council with a qualification other than those automatically recognised by the Council (previously by the Department of Education and Science), their qualifications are assessed against established criteria previously drawn up by the Department and subsequently adopted by the Teaching Council.From a teacher education perspective, specifically in the areas of professional/curriculum studies and teaching practice, the criteria are broken down by sector — Primary and Post Primary — each focusing on the teaching of the specific age ranges 4-12 years (Primary) and 12-18 years (Post Primary). If the teacher in question meets the requirements for the Primary sector, he or she may be recognised as a primary school teacher for the purposes of registration with the Teaching Council.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The Rules for National Schools specify that a school must be open to receive pupils not later than 09.30 a.m. Subject to this requirement, the decision with regard to the actual opening time of a school is a matter for the Board of Management of the school concerned. There are no proposals to change this position.Circular 11/95 and the Rules for National Schools state that pupils in infant classes may have a school day that is one hour shorter than the length of the normal school day, (i.e. 5 hours and forty minutes).  It is a matter for the Board of Management of a particular school to decide whether this concession should be applied in the case of its school. If pupils in infant classes are being given a shorter day, their parents should be notified accordingly and invited to collect them at time of dismissal.Schools that have notified parents of their policy in this regard would be entitled to expect that parents would comply with the stated policy. However, it is acknowledged that particular circumstances can arise whereby the implementation of the shorter school day for pupils in infant classes can cause difficulties for some parents. This can be especially so where, for instance, parents have other children in senior classes in the school who would not be finished until one hour after the infant classes have concluded.In such situations parents should make contact with the Board of Management of the school and explain the difficulties that they will encounter if the school policy is strictly implemented. The Department would request schools to take a sympathetic approach to cases where the school policy causes genuine difficulties for parents.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	548	The Office of Public Works (OPW) are acting on behalf of my Department on the acquisition of a site for this school. The site comprises two lots of lands. Contracts have been signed. The Chief State Solicitor is, however, still awaiting further documentation that is needed to close the sale and transfer title and his Office is in regular contact with the vendors' Solicitors to expedite closure.When the site is secured the school project can be considered for further advancement in the context of the School Building and Modernisation Programme.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	550	The School Planning Section of the Department processes applications for school building projects on an ongoing basis.  The appointment of a design team to suitable projects, is considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  Such appointments are included as part of a series of announcements published at intervals on the Department's website.In general, temporary accommodation is provided as an interim measure to facilitate schools where there is an immediate shortfall in accommodation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Significant progress has been made in progressing a range of areas highlighted in the Report of the Task Force on the Physical Sciences e.g.A new science curriculum has been introduced at primary level supported by a resource grant in December 2004 of €1000 per school plus €10 per pupil.A revised syllabus in Junior Certificate Science was introduced in 2003 and it was examined for the first time in June 2006. Revised syllabi in Leaving Certificate Physics, Chemistry and Biology have also been introduced and examined within the last five years. Work on the revision of the two remaining Leaving Certificate subjects — Agricultural Science and Physics and Chemistry (combined) — is well advanced. The introduction of each of the revised syllabi has been supported by comprehensive in-service programmes for teachers.Additional equipment grants have been provided to schools, and laboratories continue to be refurbished as part of the ongoing school building programme. In that context, €16 million was issued to schools in 2004 to support the implementation of the revised Junior Certificate Science syllabus.Investment in the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutes (PRTLI) is continuing apace to enhance and promote world class standards in research, innovation and development.My Department does not allocate provision for laboratory technicians/assistants in second level schools. The recommendation made by the Task Force Report in this area, in 2002 prices, was costed at €18.8m annually. The current cost of such provision is estimated at c. €24.6m for science subjects only, but could exceed €120m annually if applied to other practical subjects. While I have made it clear that I am not yet convinced of the need for lab assistants and that I believe that their provision would lead to demands for similar assistance in other subjects with a strong practical component, the Government is committed under the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation to re-visiting the issue. A decision on this issue can only be made in the context of the resources available from time to time in the Estimates.As the Deputy will be aware, the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2006 to 2013 sets out a range of measures to further strengthen science teaching and learning and improve the uptake of senior cycle Physics and Chemistry. These include ensuring that the project based hands-on investigative approach now in place at junior cycle is extended to senior cycle, that the appropriate type of assessment is used and that there is an emphasis on the inter-disciplinary nature of science in society.Other aspects of the Plan include:reviewing the implementation of the primary science curriculum to ensure its effectiveness in stimulating interest and awareness in science at a very young age,strengthening teacher training in this areareforming maths and Leaving Certificate Physics and Chemistry curriculapromotion of science initiatives in Transition Year; andthe provision of information and brochures on science opportunities and careers, linking effectively with school guidance services.Taken together, the comprehensive set of measures provided for in the SSTI will build on the improvements made in recent years and ensure even greater support for science education.

On Monday, 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme 2007.  However, this application was not successful.In the context of the available funding for temporary accommodation and the number of applications for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved.  All schools are required, as an interim measure, to maximize the use of existing accommodation until my Department is in a position to make extra accommodation available.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	558	The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy was one of a number of schools I announced in 2005 to progress through architectural planning.  The long term projected enrolment has recently been reassessed for this school.  As the brief for the project was subsequently increased, my Department's technical team carried out an assessment to determine how best to progress the project.  It was decided that the project is a suitable candidate for an 8 Classroom Generic Repeat Design (GRD) school.  The Board of Management has accepted this proposal.Officials from my Department wrote to the Board of Management in May 2007 requesting a Stage 3 submission.  When the stage 3 submission is received in my Department, my Officials will arrange a meeting with the School Authorities and their Design Team in order to evaluate the documentation.  It is envisaged that unless there are very exceptional circumstances involved, the meeting will be sufficient to approve the stage.  Progression of the project to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I wish to advise the Deputy that the application for Home Tuition is currently under consideration within my Department for the child in question.

A meeting with the school management and their Design Team is due to be held on the 12th October to evaluate this submission.  If this submission proves satisfactory the school will be authorised to take the project to the next stage i.e. Planning Permission and preparation of Tender Documentation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	561	Since the publication of the N4/M4 area development plan, officials of the Department have met with Westmeath County Council officials on a number of occasions.  The future education infrastructural requirements at primary and post primary level in Kinnegad, and county Westmeath generally, were discussed in detail.  Population trends in the area are being monitored by School Planning Section and the necessary steps to provide for a new secondary school will be taken to meet needs as they arise.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	562	On 5 March 2007, I announced details of the schools to receive funding under the Small Schools Scheme 2007.  The application from the school to which the Deputy refers was successful and officials from School Building Section have been in contact the school authority advising them of the next steps in the process.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	563	An application for school transport on behalf of the pupil referred to by the Deputy in the details supplied was received in the School Transport Section of my Department on 21st September 2007.  Bus Éireann, which operates the School Transport Scheme on behalf of my Department, has been requested to submit a report on the availability of a school transport service to meet this pupil's needs.  When this report is received, my Department will notify the family concerned of the outcome.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that agreement has been reached to re-organise the two schools to which the Deputy refers to form junior and senior schools.  In order to ensure that future demand for education through the medium of Irish in Clondalkin can be catered for, it is the Department's intention to plan for the delivery of two sixteen classroom schools.  It has been agreed with County Dublin VEC that both schools can be developed on the site currently occupied by a second level all Irish school.  Consequently, additional capacity will also be required at that second level school.  The site is currently being master-planned and the school authorities will be kept up to date in that regard.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	565	The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body, established in accordance with the Red Cross Act, 1938, with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the Central Council. The terms and conditions of service of employees are matters for the Society itself.  The Minster for Defence has no function in the administration of the Irish Red Cross and does not get involved in the day to day running of its affairs.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	569	Permanently occupied military installations in the border region are located at Rockhill House, Letterkenny, Co. Donegal; Lifford, Co. Donegal; Finner Camp, Bundoran, Co. Donegal; Monaghan Barracks, Monaghan; Dún Uí Néill Military Barracks, Cavan and Aiken Barracks, Dundalk, Co. Louth.The Government, in July, 1998, approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks considered surplus to military requirements.  The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Islandbridge, Dublin. The sale of Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, Castleblayney Military Post, Devoy Barracks, Naas and Clancy Barracks, Dublin have been completed, together with most of Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig.  The disposal of the remaining lands at Ballincollig is being progressed at present.Subsequent to its closure, the Government decided on 1 July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare, would be among the State property released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  The legal formalities relating to its transfer under the Initiative are being progressed with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the development of the Affordable Housing Initiative, and in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's Office.No decision has been made to close further barracks.  My Department's property portfolio is, however, kept under on-going review.   Properties deemed surplus to military requirements are disposed of and the funds invested to meet the equipment and infrastructure needs of the Defence Forces.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	570	It is important at the outset to distinguish between the functions of management agents and property management companies.  Management agents undertake property-related services under contract for the property management companies which comprise the residents in multi-unit developments.  The management fee is normally set by the company and is used to fund the activities undertaken on its behalf by the management agent.Because they provide property services, management agents will, together with auctioneers and estate agents, be covered by the licensing system to be operated by the National Property Services Regulatory Authority.  In December last, the Government approved the drafting of legislation to establish this Authority and it is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.The position in relation to property management companies is that the Law Reform Commission published a Consultation Paper on Multi-Unit Developments in December last year.  The Paper outlines the broad range of issues arising in relation to the governance and operation of such developments and makes it clear that action to address the problems arising in this area will be required across several policy fields, including the planning and development code, company law, consumer protection law and the development of regulatory structures.In recognition of the cross-cutting nature of many of the issues identified by the Law Reform Commission in its Paper, a high-level interdepartmental committee has been established to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive response to these issues.  A key task of this committee is to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken and to determine a timescale for implementation.  In particular, the committee will have regard to the definitive recommendations for legislative reforms which, following a lengthy consultation process, will be set out in the Law Reform Commission's forthcoming Report on Multi-Unit Developments.  It is expected that the Report will be published later this year.

The application was forwarded to the Refugee Applications Commissioner for investigation as required under Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996.  This investigation has been completed and the Commissioner has forwarded a report to my Department.  This application will be considered by my Department and a decision will issue in due course.  At the present time Family Reunification applications are taking up to 24 months to process.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to is regularly patrolled by uniformed and plain clothes Gardaí from the Raheny Garda District.  These patrols are backed up by the District Drug Unit, Community Policing Unit and Mountain Bike Unit, supplemented by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Units.Local Garda management is aware of a number of persons who occasionally gather in the public park areas near the location referred to.  Incidents of anti-social behaviour in these areas are dealt with under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts.  I am advised that Garda patrols will be intensified.  Where there is sufficient evidence, appropriate action will be taken by the Garda authorities.Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents.  This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that the person in question made an application for Family Reunification under the provisions of Section 18 of the Refugee Act 1996 in May 2005.  The application was refused on 29 August 2006.  However, the application is being re-examined following the receipt of further requested documentation.  In this regard a decision will issue to the person in question as soon as possible.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	574	A non-EEA national who is the partner of an Irish citizen may seek permission to remain in the State based on such a relationship and each case will be considered by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service on the particular circumstances of the case.The circumstances which would support such a request would be where the partners have been in a relationship for at least 4 years (i.e. evidence of a durable relationship); the immigration record of the non-EEA national; if the persons appear to have a genuine intention of residing together in the State; if the persons have an income in the State which would support them; if there is no evidence to suggest that the request for permission to remain is being used as a way of circumventing other immigration procedures.  Evidence of a civil union or marriage entered into in another jurisdiction would not of itself determine the application but could contribute to proof of a durable relationship.The normal outcome of a successful request would be that the non-EEA national would be allowed remain in the State either as a student, a dependant of the Irish citizen or as a person entitled to work in the State subject to obtaining the relevant work permit.  While the Minister has discretion to allow persons to remain in the State with an exemption from work permit requirements it is not his general policy to do so in cases of this type.  An exemption from work permit requirements granted in a particular case cannot be used as a precedent for other cases.  There has not been a change to policy in this area recently.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	575	The detailed allocation of Garda resources, including transport, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 12 vehicles allocated to Kilkenny District for operational policing in Kilkenny City, seven of which are marked (including one motorcycle) and five are unmarked.  I am further informed that local Garda management report that the current allocation is sufficient for operational policing purposes.

I will carefully consider his proposals for re-organisation.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I propose to take Questions Nos. 459 to 461, inclusive, together.As of 31 August last, the latest date for which figures are readily available, the personnel strength of Ballinrobe Garda Station was 9 (all ranks).The following table shows the personnel strength (all ranks) of Ballinrobe Garda Station at the end of each year from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2006.31/12/0231/12/0331/12/0431/12/0531/12/0691111119The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day,  the strength of the organisation, or units within it, may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his or her Division taking everything into account.  The situation will be kept under review by the Garda Commissioner and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Ballinrobe Garda Station will be fully considered by him within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	579	As outlined in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 673 put down for answer on the 26th June 2007, persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the persons concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.An application for long term residence from the persons referred to by the Deputy was received in July 2006. I understand that applications received in early July 2006 are currently being dealt with. As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	580	As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, the Property Registration Authority was established as and from 4 November, 2006. The Property Registration Authority replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.In order to be of assistance I have forwarded the Deputy's query to the Authority for its attention and direct reply. I understand that a reply has already issued.I would also like to refer the Deputy to a service for TDs and Senators concerning the current status of applications of this type which was introduced in May 2006. The service was introduced, inter alia, to provide a speedier and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The person concerned and her daughter arrived in the State on 14 March, 2003 and claimed asylum. Their application was refused following consideration of their case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned  was informed by letter dated 19 August, 2004 that the Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of her and her daughter and afforded them three options in accordance with Section 3 (3) (b) (ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of Deportation Orders or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why they should not be deported.Their case was examined under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations submitted on their behalf for permission to remain temporarily in the State. On 11 July, 2007 I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed Deportation Orders in respect of the person concerned and her daughter. Notice of these Orders was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present herself and her daughter to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on 23 August, 2007, in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State. She presented as required and was given further presentation dates which she kept. She is due to present again on 24 October 2007 at Dundalk Garda Station.The effect of the Deportation Orders is that the persons concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter outside the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Orders remains an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. Consequently any inquiries requesting a postponement of the enforcement process should be directed to that agency.

A letter informing him of this was issued on 7 December 2005.It is open to the individual concerned to lodge a new application if and when he is in a position to meet the statutory residency requirements.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	583	An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in June 2006.On examination of this application it was determined that the individual did not meet the residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. A letter informing him of this was issued on 28 October 2006.A fresh application was received in the Citizenship Section in May 2007 and a new file number was therefore allocated. Officials in that Section are currently processing applications received in the beginning of 2005 and have approximately 14,400 applications on hand to be dealt with before that of the person concerned.   These are generally dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  It is likely that further processing of the application will commence towards the end of 2009.I will inform the Deputy and the person concerned when I have reached a decision in the matter.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	584	A list of all Garda Stations in the State, broken down by Division, is available on the Garda website (www.garda.ie/angarda/stations.html).I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Central Statistics Office is currently examining the 2006 Census of Population figures in relation to Small Area Population Statistics (SAPS). It is not expected that these SAPS figures will be available until mid-November 2007. It is, therefore, not yet possible to provide population figures for each Garda Division based on the 2006 Census figures.The personnel strength of all Gardaí, broken down by rank, in each Garda Operational District is as set out in the following table.SU — Superintendent; IN — Inspector; SG — Sergeant; GD — Garda.Divisions/DistrictCRDCACCSSUISGGDTotal

General service staff are assigned to the Equality Authority by my Department's Human Resources Division as vacancies arise.  There are currently 54 people employed in the Equality Authority, 61% of whom are women.My Department maintains records on staff with a disability on the basis of self-declaration which is provided on a confidential basis.  As the Equality Authority has a relatively small number of staff, I am reluctant to state the percentage of those staff with a disability.  I can say, however, that my Department, as a whole, exceeds the 3% target for staff with a disability.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Asylum Division and, on appeal, by the Asylum Appeals Division.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, she was informed by letter dated 16 November, 2000, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on 14 August 2007.It is open to the individual in question to lodge a new application if and when he is in a position to meet the statutory residency requirement applicable at that time.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	592	On 28th August, the Welsh Assembly Government issued a press statement announcing that it was to publish draft guidance for professionals with responsibility for the care and protection of children, aimed at making them more aware of the increasing trafficking in persons and helping to safeguard children who may have been trafficked.  In that press statement, it was stated that there is an increasing trend for children to arrive via smaller airports in the UK or in Wales by ferry from Ireland.In the actual draft guidance, there is one sentence referring to Ireland.  It reads "Some children arrive in Wales by ferry from Ireland".  My officials contacted the Children's health and social services directorate of the Welsh Assembly Government for a full report on any issues that they were aware of, in relation to Ireland.  We were informed that this sentence was included based solely on anecdotal evidence provided by a Welsh NGO.In an article in Wales on Sunday on 2 September 2007, Deputy Health Minister Gwenda Thomas, who launched the Assembly Guidance for Professionals, was quoted as saying she had seen no evidence of child trafficking through Wales.The Assembly Guidance is based on a document produced by the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). The document "A Scoping Project on Child Trafficking in the UK" was published in June 2007.   This document also mentions Ireland as a Transit country.  My officials recently spoke with Ms. Aarti Kapoor, the Author of the Report for CEOP, who said that there was anecdotal evidence of trafficking through Ireland in one of the 330 cases of child trafficking examined in the study. To quote Ms. Kapoor fairly, she went on to say that she believes there is potential for trafficking through Ireland but that she has not seen any evidence of it.I am not aware of anywhere in either of these reports where Ireland is named as a major route for child trafficking, as was claimed in some coverage.That being said, I am not complacent about the trafficking of either children or adults into Ireland or into other jurisdictions via Ireland.  Legislation creating an offence of recruiting, transporting, transferring to another person, harbouring or knowingly arranging or facilitating the entry into, travel within or departure from the State of a person for the specific purpose of the trafficked person's sexual or labour exploitation or removal of his or her organs is at present being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and will be published shortly.In addition, it is intended that the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will, subject to enactment, provide the necessary framework for addressing the immigration aspects of trafficking so as to comply with the relevant protection provisions in the Council of Europe Convention. In particular, in the context of the treatment of victims, it is intended that a framework will be put in place whereby a victim of trafficking can be afforded an immediate period of recovery and reflection in the State and also, in circumstances where he or she wishes to participate in any criminal proceedings in the matter, a further period of residence to enable him or her to do so.The legislation will be the first in a series of measures to be rolled out over the next year.

That application was refused on 12th September, 2005.  On 7th September, 2005 the individual concerned applied for permission to remain in the State under the revised arrangements for parents of Irish born children born prior to 1st January, 2005, commonly referred to as the IBC/05 Scheme.  However, as the closing date for receipt of applications under the IBC/05 scheme was 31st March, 2005 the application was received too late for consideration.  Consequently the application and all supporting documentation were returned to the applicant on 26th October, 2005.  On 16th November, 2006 the person in question submitted another late application.My Department is currently appealing a number of matters related to the IBC/05 Scheme to the Supreme Court.  The application in question may be considered further in the light of the findings of the Court.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.An application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received on 18th April 2007.While applications for long term residency are under consideration, the person concerned should ensure that their permission to remain in the State is kept up to date.  I understand that applications received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with.I am informed by the Immigration Division of my Department that they will be in touch with the person concerned shortly outlining the options open to her.

As foxes are not a protected species under the Wildlife Acts I do not have a licensing or regulatory responsibility in relation to fox hunting.Applications for hunting licences under the Wildlife Act, 1976, are processed by my Department.  Each licence application is dealt with individually and any conservation impact on the particular species is taken into account in line with the provisions of the Act.  My Department recently issued a licence to the Irish Coursing Club allowing most of its affiliated clubs to net hares for the purpose of hare coursing. One Club (Westmeath United Coursing Club) has been excluded from the netting licence for the 2007/2008 season following a successful prosecution for the illegal netting of hares in 2006.  It was also decided to curtail the number of courses allowed by Cappoquin and Dungarvan coursing clubs.  There is no current evidence that coursing has a significant effect on hare populations and my decision to issue this licence took into consideration the final report of the Status of Hares in Ireland – Hare Survey of Ireland 2006/07.In relation to hare coursing, that report also highlights the significant improvement in hare survival brought about through compulsory muzzling in 1993.  While I note that the improvements made by the Irish Coursing Club are having an effect, the results of the survey highlight the need for further research into the impacts of hare coursing at a local level.My Department has been in discussions with representatives of the Ward Union Stag Hunt concerning their application for a hunting licence for the coming season.  I have raised a number of issues of serious concern with the Ward Union Hunt including in relation to conservation and protection of stags generally and compliance with previous licence conditions.  I will be making my decision on the licence application as soon as possible.Animal welfare and legal protection of animals from cruelty are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment that a comprehensive Animal Welfare Bill will be introduced, which will update existing legislation to ensure that the welfare of animals is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I refer to the reply to Question No. 188 of 27 September, 2007.  The position is unchanged.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	604	There are various legislative provisions applicable to noise nuisance, as well as a number of practical arrangements to reduce the instances of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise.  In the case of a faulty alarm, a local authority may serve a notice under this section.  Where the Council receives a complaint, an advisory letter is issued to the owner/occupier advising of the terms of the current standards for intruder alarms systems.A European Standard for external intruder alarms (EN50131) has replaced all national standards, and incorporates considerably stricter controls, regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms.  The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum duration from the sounding of external alarms in buildings; the alarms must cease automatically after the maximum duration.  This standard has been applied by the National Standards Authority of Ireland for intruder alarms installed by certified installers since 1 March 2004.The Private Security Services Act 2004 provided for the establishment of a Private Security Authority to licence, control and supervise all alarm installers of security equipment, and for the Authority to have powers to maintain and improve standards in the provision of services, including standards for intruder alarms.  I understand that with effect from 1 November 2005, installers of alarms were required to register with the Private Security Authority and with effect from 1 August 2006, installers cannot operate without a licence, the granting of which will require proof that the installer has attained the EN 50131 standard.In addition, I understand that the connection of monitored business intruder alarm systems to Garda Siochána stations is contingent upon, inter alia, the use of alarm systems which are certified by the NSAI and installed by certified installers.  The current European Standard along with improved equipment and the co-operation of the installers certified by the NSAI, should together ensure that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off will be significantly reduced.  Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the district court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.  A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department or on www.environ.ie.  I am also currently examining options to strengthen legislation on noise pollution as provided for in the Agreed Programme for Government.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	606	The Fire Services Act, 1981 places a duty of care on persons, having control of premises to which the Act applies, to take all reasonable measures to prevent the outbreak of fire and to ensure as far as possible the safety of those using the premises in the event of fire.  The Act also enables fire authorities to provide advice on fire safety measures to owners or occupiers of any premises.  Pre-fire planning is undertaken by fire authorities for premises in respect of which they consider it warranted.  The enforcement provisions and penalties for offences under the Fire Services Act, 1981 have been significantly strengthened in recent times.  Notwithstanding prevention and mitigation procedures, fires do still occur and in the event of an incident occurring at a premises, it is a matter for the relevant fire authority to provide advice and guidance to the owner or person in control to rectify any perceived deficiencies in fire safety procedures for that premises.Each local authority also has a Major Emergency Plan which may be activated in the event of a major emergency.  The Major Emergency Plans, which take account of potentially hazardous facilities, are reviewed on a regular basis and tested, including through inter agency exercises with the other principal response agencies, normally An Garda Síochána and the Health Services Executive.  As part of the Major Emergency Development Programme, 2006-2008, local authorities are conducting risk assessments of potentially hazardous facilities within their functional areas.  This risk assessment will be taken into account in the development of the new updated emergency plans.In considering an application for an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licence, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) examines, amongst other things, the necessary measures to be taken by the applicant to prevent accidents in the carrying on of an activity and where an accident occurs, the measures to be taken to limit its consequences for the environment.The Protim Abrasives warehouse in Cork, where a fire occurred in September 2007, is not a site licensed by the EPA and is therefore outside the remit of the Agency.  However, I understand that the Agency provided advice to Cork County Council on the investigation and assessment of the impact of the fire on the environment.  The Protim Abrasives factory in Dublin, subject of a fire in June 2006, is a facility which is subject to Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control licensing by the Agency.  Licensing of relevant activities including conditions attached to a licence and monitoring of compliance with a licence, are matters for the Agency.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-02 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I assume that the Question refers to conditions attached to planning permissions requiring the payment of development contributions.Development contributions are a key mechanism in ensuring that the local community gains from new developments.  Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that planning authorities may levy development contributions in respect of public infrastructure and facilities provided by, or on behalf, of the local authority that benefit development in the area, based on a scheme of contributions adopted for the area.The Act requires local authorities to base the contributions levied on the actual estimated cost of providing the infrastructure in question.  It is also important to note that development contribution schemes are adopted by the elected members of planning authorities after a public consultation process.  This approach has been endorsed by the Oireachtas in the context of the Act.  In May 2007 my Department published a report arising from the deliberations of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Development Contribution Schemes.  This report was also accompanied by a guidance circular to all planning authorities which focused on a number of key issues identified by the Committee.  Authorities were reminded of the need for extensive consultation with stakeholders in drawing up and administering schemes, the importance of openness and accountability, and the importance of achieving a balance between an appropriate level of development contribution charges and the need to attract future investment into their areas.It is a matter for planning authorities to determine their own policy requirements in relation to the provision of off-street car-parking, for instance, through the inclusion of specific objectives in their Development Plans.  In drafting the Development Plan, planning authorities are statutorily required to elicit the views and comments of any interested parties through a public consultation process at draft and material amendment stages.  These views and comments are presented to the elected members by the Manager for their consideration.

In March of this year, the Council submitted proposals in respect of further works.  The Department met with the Council in May 2007 to discuss their proposals.  It is now a matter for the Council to address the issues raised by the Department in order to advance this project.

The potential scientific importance of woodland adjacent to Ballyvourney was brought to my attention during the process of route selection for a by-pass of the village which is currently being planned by the National Roads Authority (NRA) and Cork County Council as part of the larger N22 Macroom/Ballyvourney Scheme.Having considered the circumstances, including the presence in the wood of several protected species, I consider that this woodland is sufficiently important from a scientific point of view to extend an existing local woodland Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive to include it.My Department and the NRA have been working together to ensure that any implications for the timeframe for the road project arising from the designation will be minimised.  The timing of the publication of the compulsory purchase orders, following public consultation on the revised route selection, will be a matter for the NRA and the local authority.

In approving a shared ownership transaction, local authorities must consider, inter alia, the ability of applicants to make the necessary mortgage and rent payments and satisfy themselves that the borrower's income is sufficient to meet the financial commitments involved under the scheme: as a guide, outgoings should not exceed 35% of a household's net income.Where difficulties do arise, Article 10 of the Housing Regulations 1980 (Amendment) Regulations 1996 provides that, in cases of hardship, the loan repayment period may be extended and arrears capitalised so as to make repayments more manageable for the borrower.

Funding for the Heritage Towns organisation would be a matter for that Department and I understand that this organisation has received funding previously.  However, my Department has a Built Heritage Capital Programme which may benefit Heritage Towns. Funds under the annual Civic Structures Conservation Grants scheme are available for the restoration and conservation of buildings of significant architectural heritage merit, which are in public ownership or open to the public generally. The 2008 scheme will be announced early next year.My Department also funds a scheme of grants for the conservation of protected buildings, which is administered by the local authorities. It is a matter for each individual local authority to assess and prioritise applications and approve funding.  The scheme is aimed at assisting owners and occupiers to carry out conservation works on structures of architectural significance which are listed in the Record of Protected Structures.  Enquiries about this scheme should be made directly to the relevant local authority.In addition, my Department has provided funding of up to €2million for 18 Walled Towns a number of which would be members of the Heritage Towns of Ireland.  Finally, the Heritage Council also makes funding available for conservation and heritage projects.

While the feasibility study indicated issues in respect of the existing water and sewage infrastructure and road network, it also included proposals to address these matters.  Infill houses are proposed in areas to minimise or avoid any unsupervised open space which may contribute to anti-social behaviour in the estate.On 11 September 2007, my Department wrote to Wicklow Town Council indicating that funding would be available for the infill houses, environmental works and infrastructure proposals as outlined.Under the Housing Management Initiative, direct control has been given to local authorities from 1 January 2007 over their internal capital receipts from the sale of local authority dwellings, to be used primarily for their improvement works programmes, including the provision of community facilities. While the Department approves the overall programmes it is the responsibility of local authorities to prioritise and advance individual projects.

Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These deal with public access to environmental information (2003/4/EC) and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures (2003/35/EC).Regulations transposing the European Communities (Access to information on the Environment) Directive 2003/4/EC were signed and came into effect on 1 May 2007.The process to transpose Directive 2003/35/EC is already well advanced with legislation completed to amend the majority of the relevant consent systems.  The remaining work will be finalised by the Departments concerned at the earliest possible date.Having regard to the above, I will ensure that the instrument of ratification of the Aarhus Convention is submitted to Government and laid before the Dáil as soon as possible.

When the new dwelling is completed, a BER certificate must be supplied to the tenant or purchaser based on the plans as constructed (to take account of any design changes during construction).  When a new dwelling is built for a specific owner-occupier, a BER certificate must be supplied by the builder, prior to the owner taking up occupation of the dwelling.Transitional BER exemptions apply to new dwellings for which planning permission was applied on or before 31 December 2006, where the new dwellings involved are substantially completed on or before 30 June 2008.  The transitional BER exemptions were required to avoid delaying commencement of work on new buildings at an advanced stage of design and planning and to enable the roll out of a substantial number of trained and registered BER Assessors in the first half of 2007.  The transitional exemptions also allowed Sustainable Energy Ireland to complete the setting up of a system for the smooth and efficient administration and oversight of the BER certification system — involving the recruitment of staff, the installation of ICT systems, etc.The overall systems are now in place. There are 12 approved training providers; 468 persons have attended and passed Assessor training that meets the BER training specification; and 185 of these have registered with Sustainable Energy Ireland and can undertake official ratings.

Accordingly Mayo County Council will hold information on the number of quarries registered with it, and may hold information on the number of unregistered quarries.  My Department does not hold this information.With regard to action against unauthorised developments, planning authorities have substantial powers and obligations, under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2006, in relation to unauthorised developments.  The 2000 Act provided for a strengthened enforcement regime and increased penalties on conviction for the offence of unauthorised development.  Further, section 35 of the 2000 Act, as amended in 2006, gave planning authorities a new power to refuse planning permission, without recourse to the High Court, to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with a previous planning permission.The Planning Act also imposes substantial obligations on planning authorities in the enforcement area.  A planning authority is statutorily obliged to issue a warning letter in relation to any unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development), no matter how it becomes aware of it.  There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority's decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice, including the reasons for the decision, must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be informed.Planning authorities are, of course, subject to the law and if any person considers that he or she has been adversely affected by a planning authority's action, or lack of action, with regard to planning enforcement, which he or she considers was unlawful, unfair or unreasonable, it is open to the person involved to make a complaint to the Manager or Director of Planning in the first instance or to the Ombudsman.  I am not aware that any planning authority is not implementing section 261 of the Planning Act in relation to registration, etc. of quarries.

The pilot project initially involved eleven group water schemes, including Donaghmoyne, and three local authority public water supply schemes and the Department provided a 100% capital grant to finance the project under the Rural Water Programme.The Donaghmoyne Group Scheme subsequently withdrew from the pilot project, notwithstanding the special 100% grant for participating groups. Following its withdrawal from the pilot project, the Donaghmoyne Group Scheme progressed alternative upgrading works from initial planning through to construction stage.In common with other publicly funded programmes, the eligibility criteria for grant assistance under the Rural Water Programme require compliance with certain public procurement, financial management and control procedures, including prior clearance of technical specifications and approval of grants in advance of commencement of works.The Donaghmoyne Group Water Scheme Committee was advised on a number of occasions that their proposal was not in compliance with the requirements for grant purposes. In the circumstances, no funding can be made available under the Rural Water Programme.  It is expected that all funding allocated for the Rural Water Programme in 2007 will be fully drawn down.

The programme includes grants for wood chip and wood pellet boilers and stoves, solar and heat pump technologies.  The aim of this scheme was to stimulate demand for renewable heat technologies in homes.  The demand is clear, with 16,000 grants approved to date, and the sector is now on a firm footing.  The number of registered renewable energy installers has increased dramatically and there has been a ten-fold increase in products available on the Irish market.  This clearly demonstrates the very significant level of market development since the scheme was first launched.Grants are also available for the installation of renewable heat technologies in clubhouses, community centres and commercial premises throughout the country. The ReHeat scheme and its predecessor programmes have been in operation for almost two years. The scheme was expanded earlier this year to provide grants for technologies such as wood chip/pellets, geothermal and solar and to allow community and voluntary groups to avail of funding.  To date, funding has been approved for over 105 capital investments in renewable heat facilities, across the hospitality, agricultural, public, business, and industrial sectors.The White Paper on Energy Policy and the Programme for Government commit to developing Ireland's clear and undoubted potential for distributed generation, including micro-generation.  My Department is working with the relevant agencies including SEI, the Commission for Energy Regulation, ESB Networks and the Electro-Technical Council of Ireland, to put in place the appropriate administrative, technical and safety standards and practices to underpin the widespread deployment of micro generation technologies.  The question of supports for domestic wind turbines will be considered as part of this process.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.  The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).Despite these Government initiatives, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.The first phase of the procurement process, Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ), is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, Eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.  The next phase of the procurement process involves inviting candidates to participate in a competitive dialogue process.  My Department is anticipating that the award of the NBS contract will be Quarter 2 of 2008, with rollout of the services due to begin as soon as possible thereafter.  This timeline is subject to negotiations with candidates during the competitive dialogue phase of the procurement process.

The draw down of such grant aid was, however, conditional on the production of documentation to vouch that the requisite eligible capital expenditure had been incurred within one year of the grant approval offer.  There was no mechanism under the GBS for the award of supplementary payments to groups where a shortfall occurred between the vouched eligible expenditure incurred and the grant amount originally offered.
