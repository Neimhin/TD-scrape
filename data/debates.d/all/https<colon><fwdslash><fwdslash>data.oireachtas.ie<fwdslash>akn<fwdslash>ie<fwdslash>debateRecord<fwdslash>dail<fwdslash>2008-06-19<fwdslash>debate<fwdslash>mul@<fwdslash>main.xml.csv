There will be more pupils in the school next year than this year and this cutback will mean that our young pupils and teachers will suffer and Fianna Fáil will be breaking its election manifesto to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to 26 to one.

Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 12a, 19a and 12, without debate, motions re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions and referral to joint committee and Revised Estimates for Public Services 2008, agreed to?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20185	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	17	No, it is not agreed.  Earlier in the week the Taoiseach sought to portray that it was inconsistent for the Opposition parties to condemn the Government's economic management of the past four or five years and highlight the appalling consequences for public services that have flowed from this.  It is wholly inappropriate that we would take these returning Estimates without debate.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was Minister for Finance in the years leading up to now.  When a Minister for Finance engages in a foolhardy spending spree before an election, establishes unaccountable bureaucracies throughout the system, ignores repeated warnings that the housing market is over-heating, acts with inflationary budgets to fuel inflation and prices that damage our competitiveness and has a budgetary system that does not hunt down waste and does not reward high performance, the consequences are there for everyone to see.  It means that when money gets scarce the vulnerable get hurt.  That is what we are seeing.  There is nothing inconsistent about the Opposition highlighting the consequences of Government action, or rather inaction, in recent years.Last night on the Adjournment, the Ceann Comhairle allowed me to raise the matter of St. Michael's House.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Máire Hoctor, first informed the House that the Government, in its initial proposal, would provide less than half of what was needed to keep St. Michael's House ticking over.  The latest bombshell dropped by the HSE is that it is now withdrawing all commitments on the €200 million which was to have been assigned for people with disability and elderly people.  No commitments are being made on that funding and the HSE is withholding the possibility that it will veer that money to find the so-called efficiencies that are looked for.  This is appalling.  The most vulnerable people, including young families with children born with Down's syndrome or disability are being told by the service providers that they will have no service.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20185	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	19	How can the Government justify that and ask us to nod through, without debate, the returning of the Estimates to the House?  Even with a 9% increase in spending this year, which it is making, the Government cannot deliver the spending for people who are vulnerable.  What will it do later in the year with an increase in spending of, maybe, only 4% or 5%?  We need a serious debate and reform of the Estimates procedure.  The Minister for Finance, who is absent today, is refusing to allow any reform in the Estimates procedure so there will be serious scrutiny of choices, the way money is spent and the performance being delivered.  That is being refused to the House.  My party does not accept that the Estimates for 2008 should be nodded through without debate.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Item No. 12 deals with Revised Estimates under 41 different headings.  These were first published prior to the budget last year and are now, effectively, redundant.  If the money had been there to meet them they would have been dealt with in the budget.  We now know there is a great shortfall in the income available to the Government so that these Estimates are a piece of nonsense.  Furthermore, Members of the House cannot interfere with Estimates as presented by Government.  Previously, Members could propose that money be moved from one heading to another, but that has also been prevented.There is a real need for reform of the procedure for dealing with Estimates.  Following last night's debate on the Labour Party motion on the economy, my party has no confidence in the Government's ability to deliver what was promised in the budget.  The Government now admits this will not be possible.  The Labour Party is opposed to taking these Estimates without debate and we will oppose the taking of the Estimate itself, subsequent to the Order of Business today.

I highlighted earlier, in a request under Standing Order 32, the serious effect of the contraction of health services on members of the public, particularly young people.  I ask that we avail of the opportunity for a full debate covering the raft of Revised Estimates in the current straitening economic circumstances.In times such as this we must remember that the House did a bad day's work when the Disability Bill 2001 was passed but not as rights based legislation.  Departments are now imposing the greatest pain and hurt on those who can least protect or provide for themselves.  These matters must be addressed.  In any revision of Estimates the entire impact on the daily lives of ordinary people must be factored in.  I join colleagues in requesting a full debate in the House on these matters.  It would be a key to allowing such an exchange on the floor of the Dáil.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	23	As all Members are aware, these Estimates were discussed in select committee, where they were taken line by line.  There is a new process of dealing with Estimates comparative to output statements.  Last year, the Minister for Finance afforded the opportunity to all Members of the Opposition to put forward an alternative budget.  They did not take that opportunity in the past five years.

It is a serious issue.  There are deadly feuds on our streets with innocent people being caught in the crossfire.  Spokespersons and other Members deserve more time than this.  It is a serious issue that needs more debate.  I am surprised that it is allotted only 50 minutes.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	33	This legislation was originally introduced in 1998 in very particular circumstances.  At that time, an undertaking was given that its extension would never be automatic but would be justified by the description of the circumstances which required its renewal.  In addition, a Law Reform Commission report drew attention to the question of renewing emergency legislation without either transferring it to permanent legislation or justifying the circumstances in which it is renewed.  I also draw the House's attention to international observation on "that kind of thing".  The Commission on Human Rights in Geneva commented on the weakness of renewing legislation described as emergency legislation without taking upon oneself the obligation of specifying either how the original danger had been extended or was incomplete or the new circumstances which had emerged.  The Minister has neither justified the renewal of the legislation nor transmitted it to mainstream law.  He has not said whether there are circumstances he wishes to share with us which would justify the renewal in this year.  This is neither acceptable nor good practice.

The element proposed for renewal today comes up every year.  I am of the view very strongly that it is neither appropriate nor justified to continue to renew emergency legislation in a very changed situation on the island of Ireland, and a very welcome change it is.  It is important we recognise that emergency legislation and the entire raft of so-called Offences Against the State Acts dating from 1939 to 1972 and again since 1998, with this renewable series of sections, serve no good at this point and, arguably, have served no good at any time.  It is not appropriate or justifiable to continue with this legislation with the Good Friday Agreement in place for ten years.We have a new dispensation on the island of Ireland and whatever about incidents that arise from time to time, they do not give credence to the type of legislation involved under the Offences Against the State Act, which is clearly a serious infringement of civil rights, human liberties and democratic rights.  A clear commitment was given in the course of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations by the Dublin Government representatives at the time that all the repressive legislation would be repealed.  This has never been done and remains an outstanding element of the Good Friday Agreement that has not been honoured over the decade that has passed since.It is imperative that this nettle is grasped by Government and we stop the annual renewal of these measures.  If one examines the facts statistically in relation to the employment, use and product of the Offences Against the State Act, they are clearly minuscule and the legislation makes very little contribution of any merit.  Other legislation is available to deal with other matters as they present.With regard to Deputy Bruton's reference to crime on this island, the Offences Against the State Act should not be attending to and dealing with that.  Other legislation on the Statute Book should address those matters.  The Offences Against the State Act is abhorrent to civil liberties, human rights and democracy in this State.  I urge Members to grasp the nettle and not proceed to renew.

A report on it has been carried out and laid before the House.  It is the view of the Garda and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that, as the Act has been used regularly and has been one of the most important tools available to the Garda in the ongoing fight against terrorism, its continuation for the next 12 months is necessary.  Given the security situation, especially the continued significant threat posed by dissident republican and international terrorist groups, the Government maintains the legislation is necessary.

It also includes measures to ensure prices of goods are labelled and transparent.  The National Consumer Agency is telling us there is no rational explanation for charging 30% more for products south of the Border, yet this is occurring.  Is the Tánaiste planning to introduce some consumer protections as are in the programme for Government?  Does she intend to ask the Competition Authority to investigate what is happening in the grocery market with this result?  Does she plan to have weekly information on price comparisons in order that consumers can vote with their feet?  What action was taken as a result of her meeting with these fleecers?  What will be her response?

The current position is not acceptable.  I have had meetings with the National Consumer Agency, Retail Ireland and all the major people in the retail sector.  While I am not considering changing any legislation at this point, further surveys have been carried out on my instruction and these will continue.  Although there has been a slight decrease in prices, the position is still not acceptable.  I will take the matter further and deal with consumer issues.  While I agree the issue is not acceptable, I do not intend to change any legislation at this time.

We know what will be the legislation programme next week.  Thereafter, the House will sit for a further six days.  It would be useful for the working of the Dáil and to allow the Opposition to do its job if we could get an indication of what the business will be in the other six days before the House closes down.  Will the Government indicate whether it plans to publish further Bills before the end of the Dáil term and if it intends to complete any of the Bills it has not published?  Only five of the 17 Bills promised in this session have been published, while the 12 remaining Bills have not been touched, as far as we can ascertain.  It is important we do not have the usual end of term raft of legislation being rushed in, insufficiently debated and guillotined through the House.  The Labour Party will strongly oppose any attempt to do this and I hope the new Government Whip will not attempt to take this type of approach.On specific legislation, if the Ceann Comhairle gives me a little latitude, I propose to restate the position in the matter of management companies to enable people to understand what we are talking about.  Management companies operate in particular in the counties around the city of Dublin — one probably does not have them in Counties Donegal, Cavan or Monaghan — in standard housing estates where there are no flats, apartments or gates.  They are ripping off people to the tune of €1,200 per annum for cutting grass and carrying out the functions of the developer who has a legal responsibility in the matter.

The management companies, funded by those who bought houses in these estates, must pay for the jobs the developer is required to carry out.  We have been promised three Bills in this matter, one each from the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, respectively.  Only one Bill has appeared on the list of legislation.  The Bill we were promised from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in March was to be the start of the process of establishing some form of control and regulation for management companies and would allow those companies that are not required to be abolished and people to get their money back.  While we were promised legislation in the three areas I outlined, progress is not being made on them.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	51	A meeting will be held and the Deputy will know all about it afterwards.The issue of management companies has been raised every Thursday for the past seven weeks.  Unfortunately, however, Deputies have not heard what I have said on this matter.  The Law Reform Commission will submit its proposals in the next number of days.  Arising from that, a decision will be made on the legislation currently under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with inputs being made by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and my Department.  It is our clear intention, arising from the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, to prepare legislation.  We gave an undertaking to consult the Opposition and others with an interest in this matter prior to its final publication.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	52	It is now clear that just 50% of the commitments given on social and affordable housing for the period 2007-09 will be fulfilled.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	57	It is the same.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Is it?  I have asked about this on a few occasions and we have not seen it yet.  It will give local authorities powers to deal with anti-social behaviour.  This is needed sooner rather than later because of what is going on in some of the housing estates in every county.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	59	It is part of that legislation which will be published this session.

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I made a special effort this morning.  When can we expect the fisheries amendment Bill and the fisheries consolidation Bill to be published?  On that, I welcome Ms Justice Mary Laffoy's rescinding of the Bill the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, brought in here quietly one night.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	66	The Deputy cannot do that.  On the legislation, the Tánaiste.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	67	It was rescinded by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy and I am glad that she did that on behalf of the fishermen of An Cromán.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	69	The fisheries amendment Bill will be published this year.  It has not been decided when the fisheries consolidation Bill will be brought forward.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I seek further clarification on the issue raised by my colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan.  Is it intended to address the issue of voluntary housing organisations, which are growing rapidly throughout the country and which are obviously cherry-picking in many instances?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	71	What is the legislation?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Is the Government likely to deal with that in the context of the Social Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill?  On another issue of promised legislation, there is an increasing trend of family home repossessions throughout the country resulting from negative equity.  It is a serious problem for many families, particularly when they must reach settlements with financial institutions——

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Every day we have been raising the health (long-term residential care services) Bill.  This is an extremely serious situation.  This was promised for December 2006 and we still have not got it, yet money is not being allowed to be passed on to cover nursing homes for invalids.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	95	It is completely unacceptable that the elderly and disabled should be abused like that.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	97	On the same issue, the Taoiseach acknowledged that the legislation will not be processed before the summer, but will it be published before the summer?  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, told us yesterday that discussions are ongoing about using some of the €110 million that was allocated for the fair deal legislation to alleviate hardship among families who are paying high nursing home charges.  When will those discussions be concluded and will families be helped?

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	99	On the justice side, we are awaiting a Law Reform Commission report and then we will follow on with the legislation.  It has been stated on a number of occasions in this House that there are difficulties with the fair deal legislation.  It will be published in July.  It will not be taken by the House in July but it will be published at that time.  I am not familiar with the other issue.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	100	What about the tagging?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Later this year.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	103	On the last count, there were four or five Ministers of State in the Department of Education and Science.  At times, it is hard to keep up with it.  Surely, they all are overburdened with work.  It is proposed by the Taoiseach that the youth affairs section of the Department will be hived off to the Department of Health and Children, which effectively leaves the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, with a two-day week job in Marlborough Street.  Before a decision is taken by the Minister to do this, will the House have an opportunity to debate what is, in effect, a transferring order for an entire section of one Department to another, given that non-formal education sectors such as youth work are an essential part of the Department of Education and Science, not the Department of Health and Children.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Is secondary legislation promised by way of a transfer order on this matter?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	105	There is no need for primary legislation.  This will be dealt with by the Cabinet.  That is a slight on the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Seán Haughey, who is also Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	106	He has two jobs, fantastic.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	108	Given the urgent need to raise the level of sporting provisions and our close proximity to the London Olympics, when can we expect the Irish Sports Council (amendment) Bill to be published?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	109	The draft is close to finalisation.  It is the intention of the Minister to bring it forward by the end of the year.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I asked this question previously but I did not get an answer from the Taoiseach and, therefore, I am asking the Tánaiste now.  It is about secondary legislation.  It is of great public concern that electricity bills are increasing by 30%.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced last January that there would be a special tariff scheme for offshore wind generation.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	111	That is not relevant now.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	112	It is secondary legislation.  I am trying to get an answer on an extremely important issue at a time when many families are facing a bitter winter.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with great fanfare, announced last January that he was introducing a new tariff scheme to develop offshore wind generation to ensure that up to 42% renewables will enter the electricity grid, but that is not happening.  Nothing is happening because the secondary legislation has not been put in place.  Why is that so?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The Tánaiste is entitled under Standing Orders to defer a question on secondary legislation to another day.  It is not primary legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The issue was raised with the Taoiseach.  The line Minister has been asked to contact the Deputy directly with a view to familiarising her with the issue.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Deputy O'Sullivan, have we dealt with——
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I am sorry, this is my problem.  With all due respect to the Ceann Comhairle, who is extremely helpful to Deputies, secondary legislation is an issue that we can raise.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	117	It is.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I am raising secondary legislation on an essential matter and, frankly, the Tánaiste's reply is inadequate.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I know that, but can I explain something?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I have not received information on an issue relating to legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The Minister is abroad at present but I will ask him on his return to speak to the Deputy on the matter.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	122	For the purposes of clarification, the Standing Order is clear on the making of secondary legislation and questions on it.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or whoever is replying to the Order of Business on any given day is of course obliged to answer questions on secondary legislation — Deputy McManus is right — but because secondary legislation is so plentiful, he or she may defer replying to a question relating to the making of that legislation to another day.  That is all I was saying.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan has contributed already, I call Deputy Ó Caoláin.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	123	It is not a coincidence that many of the questions this morning have focused on housing related legislation and I, too, want to ask the Tánaiste about specific legislation.  With the slowdown in the construction sector, we are seeing many major job losses and yet there is a considerable need for social and affordable housing.  One of the promised pieces of relevant legislation which we have heard very little about is the designated land (housing development) Bill, which is to provide a "use it or lose it" scheme, a carrot or stick, call it as you will, for local authorities to expedite the use of development land within their respective catchment areas.  When it is intended to bring forward the details of the designated land (housing development) Bill?  If not before the summer recess, when will it be brought before this House?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Beidh sé ag deireadh na bliana seo.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I refer to two promised Bills.  The Irish Sports Council (amendment) Bill has been raised already but I would like clarification on it.  The Minister said a Bill would be published if a decision was made to proceed.  He said he was considering the matter but had not made a decision.  I would like clarification on the status of that Bill.  What is the status of the greyhound industry (amendment) Bill now that we have the Bord na gCon report?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The greyhound industry (amendment) Bill will be brought forward later this year.  The Minister has not made a final decision on the Irish Sports Council (amendment) Bill but hopes to do so soon.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	127	When will the victims' rights Bill be published and circulated?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The Minister is holding a press conference on that issue at present.  I am not being facetious but I am surprised to see the Deputy here.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I am required by the Whip to be here.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The Minister has indicated that he proposes to introduce legislation on this matter but I am not sure when that will be.  He only made the announcement today, so it would be hard for him to tell us.  It will go through the normal procedure of being brought to Government and through the parliamentary process.  It will be important legislation and we will all be anxious to bring it before the House as quickly as possible.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	131	On that precise matter, it was a bit mean of the Government and the Minister to gazump this House in that fashion.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was scheduled to be here all day to deal with two issues, including the offences against the State motion, which is important.  Is the Tánaiste saying he will not be here in a few minutes to deal with that motion and that he will not be here to deal with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill?  The real reason the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is making this announcement today, which is not in the programme for Government nor among any of the 62 Bills promised——

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	418	The motion seeks approval for the continuance in operation of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 which would otherwise cease to be in operation after 30 June next.  This legislation was enacted in the aftermath of the atrocity in Omagh in August 1998.  This was a dreadful act which claimed the lives of 29 innocent people and injured over 200 others.The callous attack at Omagh was designed to undermine the fledgling peace process and, thankfully, it failed in that aim.  Ten years later we can reflect on the great strides made in normalising politics in Northern Ireland, the successful partnership in the devolved Executive and an ever closer North-South relationship.Given the very exceptional circumstances which surrounded the enactment of the 1998 Act, it was decided that certain sections should be revisited annually by the Oireachtas.  The aim is to allow this House and the Seanad to decide if the current circumstances justify the continuation in operation of those provisions.  Accordingly, the House must decide if the situation that exists still warrants the continued operation of these provisions for a further period not exceeding 12 months.  For my part, I have no doubt that they do.To support the consideration by Deputies of the necessity for the renewal of the relevant sections of the Act, I am required to lay a report on their operation before both Houses prior to the resolution being moved.  This report covers the period since the last such report was prepared in April 2007 and it was laid before the House on 13 June 2008.The clear lesson to be drawn from the report is that the relevant sections of the 1998 Act have been of significant value to the Garda in tackling the threat from terrorism.  The inevitable conclusion is that they should remain in operation for a further 12 months.  The Garda authorities consider that the Act continues to be a vital piece of legislative equipment in the continuing fight against terrorism.Members will be aware that, although progress has been made within Northern Ireland and the Provisional IRA is committed to following the political path, there remains a real and ongoing threat from a variety of dissident republican groups.  We should not be complacent or presume that the success of the peace process has somehow removed this threat.  The House will scarcely need reminding of recent attempts to kill members of the PSNI — two shootings of off-duty officers in November last year and a further car-bomb attack in Tyrone only last month.The 18th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission, IMC, published on 1 May 2008, makes it clear that the Real IRA, the Continuity IRA, the group styling itself Óglaigh na hÉireann and the INLA all remain committed to violent paramilitary action in pursuit of their ends.  These groups continue to seek to acquire and manufacture weapons, to plant explosive devices and to target members of the security forces.Should we assume these groups are involved in some noble cause for Irish freedom, we must not forget the terrible acts they have perpetrated, including Omagh, which gave rise to the necessity for this legislation.  We cannot not forget either the clear evidence, as recorded by the IMC, of the ongoing involvement of these organisations in other serious criminal activities, including extortion, drug-dealing and brothel-keeping.  These criminal activities are carried out as much for personal gain and to support particular individual lifestyles.  There is also speculation that the terrorist expertise of these groups has in some cases been sought by organised criminal gangs.  The Garda Síochána will continue actively to counter such attempts.These anti-democratic organisations remain active and determined in their opposition to peace and the rule of law.  We should not, therefore, underestimate the importance of these legislative provisions in thwarting their activities.Although the motion is concerned with provisions aimed at the threat posed by domestic terrorism, the wider international, threat cannot be ignored.  The extent of the terrorist threat in the European Union varies greatly from one member state to another.  Nevertheless, it would be foolish to imagine that Ireland is completely immune to these new forms of terrorism.  Ireland cannot be complacent in response to them.  There is also the danger of domestic groups forging international links.  We should be alert to these dangers and act, in particular, with our EU counterparts to defeat them.The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 is aimed specifically at the international threat.  It enables the application of the Offences against the State Acts, including the provisions which are under consideration today, against the activities of international terrorist groups and individuals.The report I laid before the House deals with the operation of the relevant sections since April 2007.  Section 2 was used on 80 occasions.  It provides that where, in any proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, an accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question, the court may draw such inferences as appear proper.  However, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure; there must be some other evidence which points towards a person's guilt.Section 3 was used on 12 occasions.  It provides that, in proceedings for membership of an unlawful organisation, an accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.Section 4 was used on 13 occasions.  This section amends section 3 of the Offences against the State Act 1972 in such a way as to expand the definition of "conduct" that can be considered as evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  Specifically, "conduct" can include matters such as "movements, actions, activities, or associations on the part of the accused". This change simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.Section 5 was used on 34 occasions.  It provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in certain circumstances in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts, and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years' imprisonment or more.  The effect is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his defence that he could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so.  As with section 2, a person cannot be convicted of the offence solely on an inference drawn from such a failure.Section 7 was used on 16 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.Section 8 was used on 14 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.Section 9 was used on 127 occasions.  This section makes it an offence to withhold information which a person believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by another person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for such an offence.Section 10 was used on 12 occasions.  This section extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act from 48 hours to 72 hours, but only on the express authorisation of a judge of the District Court.  In this regard, the judge must be satisfied, on the application of a Garda officer not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.  The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his behalf.  In the reporting period in question, an extension was applied for in 12 cases; two were granted, charges resulted and convictions resulted in two cases.Section 11 was used on 32 occasions.  This section allows a judge of the District Court to permit the re-arrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge.  This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána about that person's suspected participation in the offence.Section 14 is a procedural section which makes the offences created under sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and section 12 of the 1998 Act scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  This means that persons suspected of committing these offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act.  The sum total of the uses of sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and section 12 was 157.I will now deal with those sections of the 1998 Act which were not used in the period under report, namely, sections 6, 12 and 17.  Section 6 creates the offence of directing the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939.Section 12 makes it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, providing for the forfeiture of property.  Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, at its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence under that Act, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence.  The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.Although these sections were not used in the period under report, the House will agree that their continued availability is essential to an effective response to the threat from terrorist groups.  The information on the use made of the provisions of the 1998 Act is based on data received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before this House.In conclusion, on the basis of the information set out in the report, it is clear that the 1988 Act continues to be an important element of the Garda response to the threat still posed by terrorist groups here.  From the advice given by the Garda Síochána on the evident ongoing threat from terrorist groups, particularly the dissident republican groups, I consider that the relevant provisions of the 1998 Act should remain in operation for further 12 months.  I commend the resolution to the House.

The Minister had no intention of coming in here but I am pleased he did.  The Ceann Comhairle referred to the fact that any Minister or Minister of State was entitled to move any resolution on behalf of the Government.  That may be the case but this Act is one of the most important pieces of counter-terrorism legislation the State has ever enacted and the House has ever discussed.  Resolutions of this type are of fundamental importance, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform decided to pull a stroke and go to a hotel to hold a press conference, leaving the Minister of State with responsibility for children in the hapless position of having to bring this resolution before the House.  I am pleased——

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	429	——that common sense ultimately prevailed and that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, however reluctantly, is here.It is also shameful that this important business has such a restricted time allocation because in the broader context this motion has both national and international significance.  Indeed, for many years, we were all acutely aware of the threat of terrorism to human life and the very security of the State.  Throughout the painful decades of the Troubles, parts of this island endured an abnormal, fearful existence.  Thanks to the selfless and pioneering efforts of many individuals from North and South, as well as from Britain, America and beyond, we now live in a country where one can turn on the news without hearing about the latest atrocity in the North — as was the case for far too long.  These days we turn on the news and hear about cross-party efforts to attract investment to Northern Ireland and secure EU funding and we rejoice in the normality of it all.However, every now and again, we are reminded that those who have no respect for our laws, and seek to operate outside them, in their own words, have not gone away.  This was starkly and brutally evidenced in the vicious murder of the late Paul Quinn.  Last October, the 21-year-old was lured to a farm in Oram, County Monaghan, where he was beaten to death by up to 15 masked men using iron bars and nail-studded cudgels.  Mr. Quinn's family say the attack was carried out by members of the IRA because of a personal feud between Mr. Quinn and certain south Armagh republicans.  Sinn Féin has been alone among nationalist parties in maintaining that it stemmed from a row over diesel smuggling and that it was criminal in nature.  The murder of Paul Quinn certainly bore all the hallmarks of a paramilitary-style killing.The people of Cullyhanna believe that the IRA murdered Paul Quinn and as they have spent all of their lives in an area known to be strongly republican, we can safely assume that they know what they are talking about.  Unfortunately, their claims were immediately dismissed by the Irish Government as if they were not entitled to say anything that might antagonise those who have belatedly chosen to abandon the armalite in favour of the ballot box.  This attitude on the part of the Government is wholly unacceptable.  I agree we must do all we can to protect and nurture the peace process, but we cannot sacrifice justice for people such as Paul Quinn in the process.Paul Quinn's murder and its aftermath illustrated two facts starkly, the first being that certain parts of Ireland have not yet broken free from the Mafia-style rule of the IRA and, second, that people do not want to live that way.  The vast numbers of people who attended meetings organised by the Quinn family were protesting not just at Paul's death, but at the fact that they had enough of republican bullying and intimidation and did not want to live that way.  The State and the Minister must protect these people and vindicate their rights.  Treating republican thugs with kid gloves is not the way to do this.  I wonder if the Minister's absence this morning has anything to do with his own constituency and his role as organiser for Fianna Fáil in Northern Ireland.There is much evidence to suggest that paramilitary organisations continue to thrive in this State thanks to criminality.  In this context, the Government has some difficult questions to answer.  Paul Quinn lost his life in a shed used by fuel smugglers.  These people smuggle fuel across the Border and authorities on both sides of the Border appear to be doing little to stop them.  I welcome yesterday's announcement by the Northern Ireland authorities that belated efforts will be made to combat cross-Border smuggling.  Some 43% of diesel sales in Northern Ireland are of smuggled produce.  What will the Minister do about this?  Deputies McHugh and Crawford and others have consistently made representations for extra Garda resources, particularly in Border areas because of the activities of criminal gangs.The activity of criminal gangs is not confined to Northern Ireland. In the South, there are individuals and gangs who believe they are above and outside the law. The Government's failure to end gang culture and put a stop to their activities fuels this belief.  Even when members of criminal gangs are apprehended and jailed they continue to run their empires from within their prison cells through the use of mobile phone technology, and we still do not have mobile phone signal blocking technology in all our prisons.Meanwhile, the Government's half-hearted attempts to stem the flow of drugs into the country is met with derision. While our lone X-ray scanner moves from port to port, gangs simply change plans to fit in with the scanner's movements, thereby avoiding detection for the most part.  The Government ignores the gaping loophole in security at private airports, checking now and then and citing value for money as a justification for the pathetic security measures at smaller private airports.  In the meantime Customs owns one single boat — nothing more than an empty gesture, given the length of this island's coastline.In this sense, the State is complicit in the progress of criminality in this country.  It is guilty of sitting on its hands and being utterly half-hearted in its efforts to remove from circulation the drugs that keep criminal gangs in business.  Thanks to our exposed and vulnerable coastline and our poorly monitored smaller airports, drugs can come into this country with little or no difficulty.  They then serve as means by which gangs accrue money, power and influence.  They help to pay for the guns that gang members use to assassinate one another if their business interests are threatened.  In the ten years following Fianna Fáil's return to Government in 1997 there were 150 gangland murders, resulting in a paltry 24 convictions.It is little wonder the Minister chose to attend a press conference rather than deal with these important issues.  It is little wonder that assassination attempts are so often successful when there is plenty of evidence of gang members travelling overseas to avail of training in sophisticated weaponry and then returning to Ireland to use their new-found skills to deadly effect.  As we have seen in tragic cases such as the murder of Donna Cleary, sooner of later innocent people get caught up in the gangland bloodbath.Limerick is a city beleaguered by the activities of criminal gangs.  It is estimated that up to 25% of illegal discharges of firearms in the State occur in Limerick city.  In 2007 gardaí located 75 guns during raids.  A long-running feud was linked to heroin sales running to millions of euro.  Limerick has seen its name and reputation dragged through the mire because of drugs and criminal gangs, yet the Government fails to address the root cause of this problem by not dedicating the necessary resources into policing ports and airports, particularly private airports.In Dublin in recent times there has been a spate of pipe bomb attacks.  According to gardaí those responsible are members of the INLA and other paramilitary groups.  Already in 2008, the Army has been called out to deal with 20 hoax bomb attacks as well as ten viable bombs.  Both the hoax devices and the real bombs are used by rival criminal gangs to threaten particular individuals on an ongoing basis.  One of yesterday's papers reported that gardaí were extremely concerned about an ongoing sinister feud between senior INLA figures and well known drug traffickers in central Dublin.  Meanwhile, just days ago a dissident republican group attempted to murder members of the PSNI by placing a landmine under a bridge near the Border in County Fermanagh.  Two policemen were injured by the device.  Therefore, we must sadly conclude that paramilitaries are still thriving on both sides of the border more than ten years after the Good Friday Agreement.Fine Gael supports the motion before the House.  We agree with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that there remains a significant terrorist threat to the State from, inter alia, dissident groups, which warrants the continuance of relevant sections of the 1998 Act.Dissident groups are now more multifaceted than ever and have a substantial foothold in the drugs empire.  However, republican terrorism remains a threat to this State.  Last February the Real IRA announced that it was poised to launch a renewed campaign of violence across the North.  It claimed that it had streamlined its operations during a three year reorganisation and was ready to attack Britain and representatives of the Stormont power-sharing Executive. These claims were met with silence from this Government.  The Government cannot turn a blind eye to the continued threat of dissident republican groups.  This year, a report by Europol stated: "Based on capability and intent, the threat from the Continuity Irish Republican Army, CIRA, and Real Irish Republican Army, RIRA, is estimated to moderate to substantial."The report went on to detail the threat of terrorism in a wider European context, stating that there were 583 attempted or successful terrorist attacks in the EU in 2007, with the vast majority on mainland Europe.  Those incidents overwhelmingly related to disputes involving the Basques in Spain and Corsican separatists in France, with only four incidents related to Islamic terrorism in 2007.It is clear, therefore, that where terrorism is concerned we live in challenging times in both an Irish and a European context.  Our membership of the European Union is a great asset to us in countering the threat posed by international terrorism.  The Union has also been far more proactive about tackling drug trafficking than our Government, agreeing the establishment of a maritime analysis and operations centre to counteract drug trafficking.It is time that the Minister took his responsibilities more seriously.  It is time to tackle fuel smugglers in the Border areas and INLA drug smugglers in Dublin.  It is time to address the threat posed by the Real IRA and to stem the tide of drugs flowing into this country via an exposed coastline and unmonitored private airports.Renewing this motion once a year is not enough.  I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to take the threat of terrorism seriously and to meet it with a coherent policy framework and the resources necessary to end organised criminality in this State.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	430	With the agreement of the House I will share time with Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh.I received a message on Monday last to say Committee Stage of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, scheduled for this morning, could not proceed because the Minister would be in the House at the same time dealing with this motion concerning the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  Members received very little notice of this motion.  I was in my office scribbling a few words, indeed acquiescing in the motion, when I saw the Minister of State on the television screen.  I was acquiescing in the motion because the Minister with responsibility for security was solemnly telling the House that, in his judgment, a real terrorist threat was extant.  For that reason, my party and I are acquiescing in the motion.I then found a Minister of State, who has no access to intelligence data, before the House and reading a script for a Minister who is known to be in the environs of the House.  We know now that the Minister was not involved in a conflict with the timing of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill but was engaged in a stunt to upstage Fine Gael on a different matter.  To add insult to injury, when it became known that he was in the environs he came into the House, sat beside the Minister of State and tried to maintain his peace.  The Minister of State, contrary to what the Minister has just said in response to Deputy Flanagan, has no delegated powers in this area.  I challenge the Minister to say if a delegation order has been made to this Minister of State giving him responsibility for security or access to intelligence data.The Minister then purported to lecture people rather than apologise for the unconscionable arrogance, which partly explains the reaction of the people last week, when told by politicians they must do X and Y.  The Minister has shown contempt for the House and will have to learn that he must cope with an Opposition.  The Dáil is not Iveagh House and he will not be able to run around with a single transferable speech.  If he expects to get his legislative programme through the House, he will have to treat Deputies with a little more courtesy.The only important point about this debate is the assertion by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that in his opinion, relying on the intelligence available to him, there remains a terrorist threat from certain groups which warrants the continuance in force, for the time being, of the relevant sections of the 1998 Act.  The Act referred to is the emergency legislation, the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, enacted in the wake of the attack in Omagh, the single worst atrocity of the Northern Ireland conflict.I suspect most Members would prefer that we did not have to pass this resolution each year.  However, we are not in a position to second-guess the Minister on matters that affect the security of the State.  The Minister asserts there remains "a significant terrorist threat" from what he describes “inter alia” as “dissident groups”.  I am not sure what is encompassed by the term “inter alia” but it appears to refer to the threat of terrorism from sources outside the jurisdiction as well as home-grown sources.If the House does not endorse the resolution, key sections of the Act will fall.  On the face of it, the climate appears to be right to let these very severe sections lapse but that is not a view informed by intelligence advice.  I repeat that if the Minister with responsibility for security asserts, with a full sense of consciousness, that there remains "a significant terrorist threat", responsible Members of this House cannot ignore his words.  Having said that, the record is one of introducing emergency legislation to confront particular emergencies and leaving it on the Statute Book long after the emergency has passed.  For example, I recall the decision of the rainbow Government in 1995 to terminate the emergency declared to cope with circumstances that arose contemporaneously with the Second World War.  In addition, the Special Criminal Court, which was reintroduced in 1972, is still in use.People concerned about civil liberties and human rights will question the reason we need these extreme, gravely illiberal measures, including juryless trials, in a time of peace in a modern liberal democracy with a well established neutral reputation.  They will ask if it is correct for Members to repose unquestioning confidence in the assertions of the Minister.  Hence, the ludicrous position of having a Minister of State who is not in possession of the information in question seeking to assure the House.  In most similar democracies it is possible to tease out these issues in specialist committee whereas in this country these issues are rarely addressed in the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.We know from the Hederman report that the issues are complex and fundamental.  The authors of the report, under the direction of Mr. Justice Anthony Hederman, detailed widely divergent views on the necessity for and use of the Acts under review.  The main recommendations included the proposed repeal of the existing Offences against the State Acts and the introduction of new legislation which would keep in place some of their key elements.  There was also a minority report, headed up unusually by Mr. Justice Hederman, which favoured dismantling much of the existing legislation because it was seen as incompatible with a modern democratic state.  Therefore, having requested the Hederman committee to report, which it did in great detail, we find the substantial measures in the legislation, such as the continued existence of the Special Criminal Court, its use for non-terrorist "ordinary" crime, the statutory provisions for internment, whether inferences should be drawn from a suspect exercising his right to silence and so on, are the subject of different conclusions by the majority and minority in the report.It seems regrettable that such a detailed and painstaking report has been left largely undebated in the House.  Meanwhile, we have an almost casual presumption on the part of Government that the House will nod through this motion in 50 minutes.  All we have to go on is a last minute, not very informative report and the assertions of the Minister that there remains a significant terrorist threat.  If the Minister is satisfied that there is reality behind such a conclusion, I cannot see how responsible Members can risk not acquiescing in the motion.  However, I draw the attention of the House to a statement in the Hederman report:Emergency legislation may be abused for pragmatic political purposes; special powers, introduced for special reasons, may continue to be used when those reasons no longer justify this, or for purposes extending beyond those that warranted their original introduction; and powers of detention or interrogation may be used cruelly or inhumanely upon innocent (or even guilty) people.The House received minimal notice of this debate and Deputies did not receive a briefing from the Minister as to the reasons he has concluded that the security of our people warrants the endorsement of the motion.  While we have little alternative but to accept his advice, given the progress made since the horror of Omagh and the dispassionate arguments advanced in the Hederman report, the time has come for this House to schedule a proper debate on the sensitive and complex issues involved in keeping the Offences against the State Acts in place.  We also need to have a considered debate about the capacity of our criminal justice system to effectively tackle the crime bosses engaged in international drugs trafficking, poisoning so many of our young people and ravaging our most disadvantaged communities.  I hope the Minister will indicate the time has come for the House to schedule a proper, structured debate which will allow Members to have a serious discussion on the divergent views in this worthwhile, painstaking, comprehensive, detailed report on complex and sensitive issues.

Dhein mé é sin ní hamháin chun na forálacha atá á phlé againn inniu a scoir, ach freisin chun na hAchtanna ina iomlán a chur ar leathtaobh.  Tá gá ann gníomh críochnaithe faoi dhualgaisí Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta a dhéanamh.  In Airteagal 3 den Chomhaontú, ghlac an Rialtas leis go bhfuil gá ann fáil réidh le reachtaíocht éigeandála de réir mar is féidir.  Sa lá atá inniu ann, tá an deis sin againn, deich mbliana tar éis sínithe an Chomhaontú agus tírdhreach pholaitiúl an oileán athraithe ina iomlán.  Is féidir linn é sin a thapú trí an rún seo a dhiúiltiú.  Ba chóir dúinn seasamh leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Finian McGrath i rith na díospóireachta ar an cheist seo i 2005:For any citizen and democrat, repressive legislation is not the way forward.  If we are serious about protecting human and civil rights and if we are lecturing other nations on this issue, everybody should stand up and be counted and vote against this motion and this legislation.Cúig bliana ó shin, i 2003, dúirt an Teachta Ciarán Cuffe: "the state of emergency is over . . . we should drop the use of the Offences against the State Act".  He said his party "does not want to see the use of the Special Criminal Court continue".   In every subsequent year, Deputy Finian McGrath and Green Party Deputies opposed the renewal of the relevant sections of the Offences against the State Act.  It will be interesting to note what will be their stance when the House divides on the issue.The Minister has not shown that we have an emergency which could possibly justify the continuation of the draconian measures contained in the sections to be renewed today.  The case has not been proven and this legislation is contrary to Ireland's responsibilities under the derogation regimes of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is also contrary to the Good Friday Agreement requirement that steps be taken towards security normalisation, including the progressive elimination of the Acts' provisions as circumstances permit.This year, the Minister's report on the operation of the 1998 provisions is again lacking in the detail required to make an informed judgment of the operation or use and abuse of the 17 relevant sections.  Simply listing the number of occasions on which the various provisions have been used does not allow for informed democratic scrutiny of their operation.  There is not time available to me to discuss the various sections and the manner in which they fundamentally breach human rights.  However, I must note that sections 6, 12 and 17 were not used at all in the year ending April 2008.  Even leaving disproportionality and human rights non-compliance aside, their necessity has not been demonstrated.In fact, section 17 has never been used since its inception.  Section 6 has been used only twice and section 12 was only used in 2001.  Very few of the arrests under these sections resulted in charges being preferred, never mind convictions gained.  That would leave me to believe that these sections, much like the rest of the Offences Against the State Acts, are being used for trawling purposes, or may be abused for harassment purposes by gardaí of the special branch variety, similar to those cases documented in the recent Morris tribunal report.  Repression breeds resistance and that is an important lesson the Minister should bear in mind.Year on year the UN Human Rights Committee has recommended the abolition of the Special Criminal Court and of other powers related to this emergency legislation.  Earlier this month in its report to the UN Committee, the Human Rights Commission highlighted the absolute failure of the Government to address the concerns and recommendations of the UN committee.The Act is in breach of international legal instruments.  Article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights permits a state to derogate from certain human rights obligations, but only "in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation and existence of which is officially proclaimed" and only "to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation".  Derogation on the basis of pre-emption is prohibited according to the principle of strict necessity which dictates that each derogation measure "shall be directed to an actual, clear, present, or imminent danger and may not be imposed merely because of an apprehension of a potential danger".  Likewise, the European Convention on Human Rights also permits temporary derogations from certain human rights obligations, but it also imposes similar conditions to those of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.The time has come for these sections to be confined to the dustbin of history and, as Deputy Rabbitte stated, for us to have a proper debate on emergency legislation so that this State can live up to the commitments it made in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement.  If the Government really wants to protect the safety and freedoms of the Irish people, it should look towards the human security approach formalised by the 2001 UN International Commission on Human Security.  This approach moves away from viewing security as being an exclusive, invariably militarist focus on states towards the sources of daily insecurity experienced by most people such as poverty, disease, conflict, human rights abuses and economic and environmental uncertainty.  If the Government took that approach, one would see a much better security situation on this island.Repression breeds resistance and that is what feeds some of the groups which were mentioned earlier.  It is now time to get rid of the Offences Against the State Act and for the Government to adopt the repeal Bill, which I submitted yesterday.

That is what this is designed to address.I thank the Members opposite who have supported it.  Given its nature, the structure on which it is based and the fact that it must come before the House in a resolution, it is important that Members of the Opposition share the views expressed by the Minister, the Department and the Garda Síochána.  It is clear that there are significant issues still to be dealt with in this State, whether we like it or not.We are working with the PSNI, particularly in the case of Mr. Paul Quinn referred to earlier, to find the people responsible.  I do not accept for one minute any suggestion that the Government has made an assessment on its own in this regard.  The Garda and the PSNI are solidly of the view that the murder of Mr. Quinn was not a sanctioned IRA activity and this has been confirmed by the Independent Monitoring Commission.Returning to the Act, its provisions have been used on 800 occasions over the past 12 months, which is significant.  Some 34 convictions have been obtained during that same period and 154 persons are currently awaiting trial.  Those figures alone demonstrate that there is a need for these provisions to continue in operation.As I stated earlier, the dissident republican groups are very active and ruthless in their determination.  One need only consider some of the recent incidents that have taken place.  There was one incident earlier this month and the attack on the two PSNI officers previously.  The IMC's recent report refers to actions attributed to dissident groups, including murder, a pipe-bomb attack, a number of shootings and assaults.  The Garda Síochána has intelligence that these dissident groups are still very active.  As Minister, I can confirm that this is the position.  The Garda has made a number of recent arrests of individuals in connection with dissident terrorist activities and we want to continue to resource the Garda to ensure that it can continue that fight.The State and the Oireachtas has a responsibility to protect our citizens.  In an ideal world, we would not like to have this type of legislation.  Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world because of the continued terrorist threat.  The effort by those terrorists to destabilise the peace process that has been put in place on this island is ever present.  I strongly urge the House to back this motion.  I thank the parties who support the continuation of this legislation.

I especially thank those Deputies who spoke on Second Stage and who contributed on Committee Stage for their positive input to the Bill and its various provisions dealing with the east-west electricity interconnector.  I note all Deputies recognise the strategic national importance of the interconnector and the pressing need to expedite its delivery in the shortest possible timeframe.I take this opportunity to mention some of the potential benefits to Ireland from interconnection with the UK market.  The annual generation adequacy report, produced by EirGrid, sets out forecasts for the supply and demand balance for electricity over a seven year period.  This report has identified a need for additional capacity over the next seven years to maintain security of electricity supply.  I am advised there is significant generation capacity available in the British energy market.  The east-west interconnector will link Ireland to that market, enhancing security of supply on this island.As the UK market is also one of the most liberalised energy markets in Europe, the east-west interconnector will also enhance competition in the Irish electricity market.  This, together with the all-island single electricity market should, over time, exert downward pressure on electricity prices.The east-west interconnector will also enhance fuel diversity by providing an external source of electricity which will reduce our dependency on gas-powered generation.  At present, some 60% of our electricity is generated from natural gas, which is primarily imported from the UK.  The east-west interconnector will also support the increased penetration of renewable generation, particularly non-dispatchable wind generation in the Irish market.  It will allow surplus power to be exported to Britain in times of high wind generation.  As a nation we have set ambitious targets of progressively achieving 33% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020.  The all-island grid study shows that even higher targets may be possible.  This study also identifies the east-west interconnector as a key enabler for delivering these ambitious renewables targets.  It is for these reasons the Government has attached such a high priority to the delivery of the east-west interconnector.The Bill is one of a suite of important measures that will allow the Government to continue to drive forward its progressive energy agenda.  One amendment was introduced on Committee Stage to clarify the powers of subsidiaries of EirGrid.  This step was taken with a view to ensuring there is absolute transparency and certainty as to the powers of subsidiaries of EirGrid to carry out certain functions with regard to the east-west interconnector.  The amendment was drawn up in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and eliminates any legal uncertainties regarding subsidiary companies.  EirGrid has advised that the amendment will help avert any potential delays to the commissioning of the interconnector by 2012.The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, along with EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation is continuing to examine all aspects of this project with a view to ensuring all possible steps are taken to expedite the planning and development processes.  In the meantime, the Department is continuing to participate in the high-level co-ordination group, which has been established under the chairmanship of the Commission for Energy Regulation to oversee and ensure completion of the project to schedule.  I am advised that work is progressing well.  This work will be further facilitated by the swift passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas.  I again thank all Deputies for their co-operation and assistance in advancing this Bill through the House.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	443	That there are no amendments to the legislation at this stage is an indication that the Opposition, especially Fine Gael, is supportive of this legislation.  This support is principally because of the frustration that this legislation was not produced years ago.  The east-west interconnector should have been built and be operating by now, providing security of supply, which Ireland desperately needs, and alternative energy to stimulate more competition for power generators in Ireland.The cost of electricity has increased significantly in the past two to three years.  Electricity bills for businesses and households have doubled rather than increased in line with inflation.  This is because we have failed to reap the benefits of competition in energy generation in Ireland.  We have been at pains to try to put in place competition in the energy market, as we are required to, but we have not had the benefits of that, which is a problem.Part of the reason for this failure is the size of the energy market in Ireland and the difficulty with attracting large investors to produce energy and to compete with the ESB.  We have some competitors such as Viridian and others.  That we now have an all-island market has assisted that process.  However, we still have not seen the positive price signals that would normally be associated with the introduction of competition into a marketplace.  The quickest method, by far, of introducing competitive pricing into the energy market is by interconnection.  It is a fact that over the past four or five years electricity prices in the UK have consistently been between 10% to 15% cheaper than here.  If one set up a business in Manchester as opposed to Dublin one would be likely to have energy bills that were dramatically smaller than in Ireland.  One cannot blame global factors for that; it is a domestic management problem that we have had with our energy industry.Interconnection is essential and it should have happened by now.  I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, in the absence of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who is ultimately responsible for this legislation — I understand the Minister is abroad, and I have no difficulty with that — to push this project and ensure EirGrid meets the deadlines it has set.  It wants to have this interconnector up and running before 2012.  I ask the Minister of State to do all that is possible to ensure this happens.The interconnector is also vital for the vision outlined by the Government to switch from using carbon based fuel as the raw material for power stations towards a more sustainable, secure source of power generation in Ireland.  This requires dramatic changes to the electricity grid and energy security of supply measures when sustainable or renewable sources of energy are not providing power.  I refer to wind power.  We put a great deal of faith in wind energy as a source of significant amounts of power for Ireland in the future.  We are likewise investing in wave energy, which is at a development stage, but by 2011 or 2012 it will be commercially operable off the west coast.  However, these sources of power are intermittent.  Wind provides power for no more than 40% of the time, which is a good average compared with other European countries.  Wave power provides electricity for 50% of the time.  In the absence of substantial storage capacity for energy, at plants such as Turlough Hill water is pumped up into a lake when excess power is generated and allowed to flow back down and drive turbines at peak times during the day.  In the absence of such capacity, substitute energy is needed.  For every megawatt produced by a turbine, it must be ensured, when it is not generating energy, that energy is obtained elsewhere.  As Ireland's energy demand increases, it can be met by renewable sources but we must have a fallback position.  If climatic conditions dictate that a large area of high pressure moves over Ireland and no wind and waves are generated for two or three days, we would have a stable supply source.The way to address this issue is storage, successfully spreading the risk from renewables and interconnection.  That is one the reasons, from a renewable energy point of view, interconnection is vital.  Power can be used as it is needed when sufficient power cannot be generated from renewable sources.  The issue is not only about taking energy from the British grid, but exporting green energy in order that Ireland can become a nation that gains a reputation for being ahead of the curve in renewable energy generation, whether that is in research and technology or output.  We can become a substantial exporter of green energy through interconnection, initially with Britain and then with the rest of Europe, and a premium could be charged for that because a price premium will attach to that as we move to an aggressive carbon trading system across the EU.  The opportunity is there for a new industry to expand and develop and to generate the high technology jobs we need.  Ireland has a competitive advantage because of its climate, which consistently provides the necessary wind speeds and wave sizes.The interconnector involves more than plugging into the British grid and accessing a cheap source of power.  While this is important, it is also about facilitating the expansion of an industry, security of supply and providing a broader energy mix.  That is why the private sector is planning to build interconnectors and it is anxious to get in on the act.  A company is considering building two east-west interconnectors in addition to EirGrid's because it thinks there is a market for them.  It plans to have an interconnector between Wexford and Wales built and operating by the end of 2010, which highlights how quickly a project can be undertaken when it is driven.  Departmental officials may be sceptical about that, but that is the company's aspiration.Meanwhile, the House has debated the State building an interconnector for eight years.  I recall two years into my first term as a Member the Government discussing the need for interconnectors with expressions of interest being invited from the private sector on how to finance them.  Eight years later, we are passing legislation that will provide for an interconnector by 2012.  That is how slowly the State has moved on this issue.  It is welcome that this is finally happening and Fine Gael supports it.  My party is happy to facilitate the swift passage of the legislation, but while it is not too little, it is too late.  Let us get this built.  The Minister needs to drive this project because EirGrid is anxious to push ahead.  However, the company may need assistance getting through the planning process and so on.I refer to the financing of the interconnector.  It is estimated that it will cost €300 million to build.  EirGrid is being provided with a borrowing capacity of €750 million, more than double the cost of the interconnector, which presumably will cover other projects down the line.  However, EirGrid holds a legitimate aspiration that the State might sponsor part of the cost of the project.  Does the Government plan to permit EirGrid to borrow all the money provided for or will it rely on taxpayers' money to partially fund the project in the context of a private operator building an interconnector on an east-west basis that will provide an alternative supply source?  The price of energy provided through the interconnectors will be set by the regulator and the EirGrid project will be an extension of the national grid.  Given the state of the public finances, I suspect the Government cannot afford to fund this project.  I do not expect a reply to this question now but I would like the Minister of State to contact me in writing about how the State intends to assist in the funding of the interconnector because that will impact on EirGrid's borrowing requirements, which will need to be organised quickly as the project proceeds.  I welcome the legislation.  Let us get on with the project.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I thank the Deputy for his positive contribution.  No matter how enthusiastic we are when we enter the House, the wheels never turn as quickly as we would like, which surprises us.  I appreciate his support and acknowledge his contribution.  I assure him my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, will press forward with the project to ensure the benefits the Deputy outlined in the context of competition, security of supply and increased renewable generation will be available in the market as soon as possible.  The EirGrid project is proceeding well and we will continue to ensure it is expedited.A final decision on financing has yet to be reached but, once the process to select a tender is complete, we hope to decide on the financial package for the interconnector.  The Bill provides EirGrid with the capacity to borrow up to €750 million but that does not mean all the money will be raised for this project.  Consideration has been given to an Exchequer contribution but that decision has yet to be made.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I welcome this opportunity to review the issues relating to the fishing industry and, in particular, to consider the current difficulties it is facing arising from high fuel costs.As Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries I would like to assure the House of my full commitment and, that of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to a long-term sustainable and profitable fishing industry which is absolutely critical to coastal communities around the country where alternative economic activities are limited.Quality, safe seafood is of the highest importance to consumers and we have in Ireland access to a resource that will deliver high quality local products to the Irish market.  The fishing industry is an indigenous industry creating jobs and wealth in parts of the country that do not have access to much of the other urban based employment and wealth creation opportunities.  The Government is, and has been, fully committed to the development of the industry which is based on an indigenous and perpetually renewable resource and of ever increasing value.It is fair to say that it has been recognised by both successive Governments and the fishing industry for some time that there was need to address some of the fundamental problems facing the fishing industry in Ireland.  In recognition of this situation, the Minister appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to chair an independent review of the industry and to bring forward a plan for its restructuring and development.  Following intensive discussions around the coast with fishermen and fishing communities, Dr. Cawley, with the support of Mr. Joey Murrin and Mr. Ruain Ó Brie, brought forward a strategy, Steering A New Course: A Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013.The strategy sets out a vision for a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant industry to maximise its long-term contribution to coastal communities based on fish stocks restored to sustainable levels in the context of a healthy and diverse marine environment.  It focuses on a number of key areas, including the restructuring of the fishing fleet to bring it into balance with available resources, a more innovative and co-ordinated approach to the marketing of seafood capitalising on its healthy and nutritious image and, maximising the value of seafood at every stage from the sea to the table.  The Government has committed to this strategy in the programme for Government and has provided for its implementation in the National Development Plan 2007-2013.The escalation of fuel costs as a result of global economic and political conditions remains a matter of serious concern for all sectors of industry.  However, it is acknowledged that the fishing industry's reliance on fuel is such that it is impacted on far more than other sectors.  I reassure the House that I am fully cognisant of, and sympathetic to, the plight of Irish fishermen in the current climate.  It would be simplistic and irresponsible to suggest that there are any quick fixes to the current hiatus but I firmly believe that solutions are to a large extent set down in the Cawley strategy.  We would be foolish if we abandon the course of actions which were carefully thought through to address many of the fundamental structural current problems facing the industry.  We must stay on course and the Government and I remain fully committed to the delivery of the Cawley strategy.The problems identified in the Cawley strategy have been further compounded by increases in the price of fuel.  The immediate short-term measures proposed by the fishing industry, such as tie-up aid, can only be addressed in Europe.  I firmly believe that the fuel crisis facing the Irish fishing industry is a European issue and can only be comprehensively dealt with in the European context.The Minister and I met with the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, shortly after our appointments to get a flavour of issues facing the fishing sector and heard directly from it the impact of high fuel costs on the Irish industry.  As we realised the serious impacts we decided that we needed to immediately bring the matter to the attention of the EU Commission as this was clearly a European issue.  Without delay, the Minister spoke at length by phone to Commissioner Borg on 6 June outlining his misgivings at the slow response from the Commission to the current situation and conveyed to him the industry's dismay at the position in which it finds itself.Following much publicised unrest, the Minister and I again met with the FIF in Athlone on 13 June.  Following a nine hour frank and productive meeting, we committed to meeting with Commissioner Borg in advance of the Fisheries Council to re-emphasise in the strongest possible terms the long-term and short-term issues facing the Irish fishing industry and to press for a fast and effective EU Commission response to the impact of high oil prices, and other issues, on Ireland's fishing fleet.The Minister and I met yesterday in Strasbourg with Commissioner Borg to discuss the difficulties being experienced by fishermen across Europe and particularly in Ireland.  At that meeting, we forcefully put to the Commissioner all the key points raised by the Federation of Irish Fishermen last Friday.  In the course of the meeting, we impressed upon the Commissioner, as we had undertaken to do during a meeting with the Federation of Irish Fishermen on Friday last, the serious difficulties and the depth of feeling of Irish fishermen and also the urgent need to bring forward a new EU-funded package of measures to alleviate the concerns of Irish fishermen.  We also discussed the proposals outlined by the Commissioner and published on Wednesday evening.While I welcomed the proposals, we highlighted the absence of a provision for additional EU funding to underwrite the proposals.  We indicated that the total European fisheries fund allocation to Ireland over the seven year period was only €42 million and that the Government was, under the Cawley strategy and with the support of the fishermen, about to commit at least the same amount of money in the national voluntary decommissioning scheme for older whitefish trawlers.  In that context we re-emphasised the need for the Commission to come forward with additional EU funds to support some of the emergency short term measures called for by the Federation of Irish Fishermen and outlined in the Commissioner's proposals as published.  Commissioner Borg indicated that he was exploring within DG Mare all possibilities for the identification of some additional funding for the package.I am satisfied that Commissioner Borg is now fully acquainted with the issues of concern to Irish fishermen as outlined to the Minister and me last week by the Federation of Irish Fishermen at our meeting in Athlone.  As many of the issues are also of concern to fishermen in other member states, I will be working closely with like-minded colleagues at next Tuesday's Fisheries Council to continue to press for the package of measures and additional EU funding which would be required to address the difficulties being experienced by fishermen across the EU and, particularly, in Ireland.Commissioner Borg advised that following a full discussion on the range of issues affecting the industry at next week's Council, he will propose a definitive set of proposals for presentation to the Fisheries Council on 15 July.  These proposals must include additional EU funding for the Irish fleet given the funding we have been allocated under the European Fisheries Fund of €42 million to cover the period 2007 to 2013 is woefully inadequate and is accounted for already by measures under the Cawley seafood development strategy.  These funds are in the first instance being used towards the restructuring of the fleet in the decommissioning programme being pursued and the Federation of Irish Fishermen which has confirmed to me that it does not want the funds diverted to support emergency measures.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	448	In addition to the direct impacts of high fuel costs for fishing fleets, I also raised with Commissioner Borg a number of other important issues for the Irish fishing industry that need to be addressed in the European context.  These matters were raised with the Minister and me during our meeting with the Federation of Irish Fishermen on 15 June last.The Irish industry is subject to unfair competition, in particular from fish landed by fishing vessels operating completely outside the legal framework.  This type of fishing is known as illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, fishing and the adoption of measures to eliminate IUU fish from the EU market is on the agenda of the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 23 June.IUU fishing means that catches are either misreported or not reported at all.  It is a major contributor to overfishing.  Estimates of the value of IUU fishing worldwide is €10 billion. By comparison, the value of EU landings is approximately €7 billion.  EU fishermen face fierce competition from IUU operators who disregard all the many obligations that legal operators take on.  This results in a loss of market share for the EU legal operator due to different cost structures.  The problem has worsened over recent years with the globalisation of the fisheries sector and this has led to increased trade flows of fisheries products whose legality is difficult to ascertain.The EU is the biggest market for and the leading importer of fisheries products with imports of almost €4 billion.  An estimate of illegal fisheries products imported into the EU each year is set at 500,000 tonnes with a value of €1.1 billion or even higher.  We must take strong action to address this menace which is both destroying fish stocks and undermining the markets for Irish fishermen.  The new proposals, which I will be pushing to be adopted at next week's Fisheries Council focus on trade measures and put the onus on member states where fish are landed or imported to verify that they were caught using legal means.  They also include provisions setting down sanctions against countries which continue to facilitate IUU fishing by providing flags of convenience for illegal vessels.  This is an important new policy, which is timely and urgent.  It will, I believe, support the EU market for Irish fishermen and contribute to improving fish prices.Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries, one of the most common issues of concern raised with me by the general public is the level of discards occurring around our coast.  I am fully committed to finding solutions to this problem as early as possible.  Again, tackling discards, especially of mature fish, was one of the key concerns which was identified at the meeting with the FIF.  I share the concerns of fishermen and the general public in regard to the issue of discarding marketable fish and small fish which are the seed crop for the coming years.I have been fully briefed on the issues and I am advised that the issue is complex and challenging.  The issue of high levels of discards in commercial sea fisheries is a global problem and is on the agenda of all major international organisations that deal with the development of sustainable sea fisheries and the protection of marine ecosystems.  Fish discarding is a complex problem and is a feature of most fisheries particularly in mixed fisheries such as those which prevail in waters around Ireland.  The solution to discarding must be found at the European level because the rules on fishing gears, mesh sizes and the recording of catches are all set at European level and are applicable to all EU fleets.Discarding means the deliberate jettisoning of all or some of a catch by a fishing vessel.  There can be a number of reasons for discarding, including for example where a catch takes the vessel over its quota for that species; the vessel has no quota allocation for a particular species taken in a mixed fishery; the catch taken contains fish below minimum landing sizes; the practice of high grading, which happens when some of the catch is of varying size or quality — only the best will be retained and the rest discarded; or, the species caught has low or no market demand or the price is too low.  Fish discarded do not usually survive but are not recorded in the vessel's logbook as part of the catch and so the true amount of fish taken out of a stock cannot be determined accurately.  This has implications for appropriate and sustainable fisheries management and also particularly impacts on young fish.  The specification of minimum landing sizes is intended to provide protection in particular for young fish, in order to provide for the continuation of the stock and the sustainability of the fishery.A 2005 study published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation estimated the amount of discards in the North Atlantic at 1,332,000 tonnes per year, approximately 13% of the catches.  The estimated discards for the North Sea ranged from 500,000 to 880,000 tonnes.  To the west of Ireland and Scotland, discards ranged from 31% to 90% of catches, depending on the fleets, target species and depth.  In the Mediterranean and Black Seas, discards amounted to 18,000 tonnes or 4.9% of the catches.  In the Baltic, this rate was estimated to be low, at an average of 1.4%.There is general agreement among fishermen, managers, and scientists alike that such practices are wasteful and destructive and must be reduced although it is doubtful that they can be eliminated completely, particularly in mixed fisheries.  The focus, therefore, must be to minimise them.Ireland has been to the forefront in pressing for action on this issue at European level.  During the Irish Presidency in 2004, we chose the theme of fast tracking the development of environmentally friendly fishing methods as a key focus.  A major international conference was held in Dundalk involving EU member states, Norway and Iceland, with the emphasis on how to reduce discards in commercial fisheries.  Measures proposed to tackle discarding and supported by various stakeholders include improvements in fishing gears and gear selectivity, improvements in fishing methods and fishing practices, the recording of catches rather than landings, onboard observer schemes etc.A joint Irish-UK pilot project in the Irish Sea aims to reduce discarding.  The Irish Sea enhanced data collection project has been developed collaboratively between fishing industry representatives, scientists, the North West Waters Regional Advisory Committee and the national administrations from Ireland, England and Northern Ireland.  This study is a very important step in the collection of data on discards with the aim of introducing a scheme whereby discards would be minimised and ultimately eliminated.The European Commission has made the elimination of discarding one of the four main fisheries priorities for its Fisheries Directorate.  The Commission adopted a communication on the issue of discards in fisheries on 28 March 2007.  Following further work, a communication on a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and discards in European fisheries was presented to Council in June 2007.  The Council adopted a range of conclusions on the Commission proposal and these will determine the agenda at European level on this issue for the immediate future.The current programme for Government commits to increasing supports to assist fishermen to make the change over to more environmentally friendly fishing gear and I am confident that this will also assist in reducing the incidence of discarding in key fisheries.  At my meeting yesterday with Commissioner Borg I raised this issue as a priority for me, and for the Federation of Irish Fishermen.  While he acknowledged that finding effective solutions is challenging, he restated his commitment to continue to prioritise the current work programme agreed by the Council in June 2007.  I will continue to press for progress on this issue at national, EU and international levels and I am confident that with the co-operation, collaboration and commitment of all the stakeholders significant improvements can be achieved in this most sensitive area for the long-term sustainability of our industry.Industry representatives highlighted to me the particular difficulties they are currently experiencing in the cod fishery in the Celtic Sea.  The landings of cod have been high so far this year.  A relatively open regime for fishing these stocks was put in place in conjunction with the industry early in the year, reflecting the good market prices available at that time.  As a result the cod quotas around the coast are fully exhausted or almost so.  This poses a very difficult problem for fishermen now because cod is taken in a mixed fishery with other stocks such as haddock and whiting as well as in the nephrops fishery and cod caught has to be either completely discarded or part discarded depending on the situation with the relevant quota.For the Celtic Sea cod stock, the 2008 quotas were set at the December 2007 Fisheries Council where a preliminary 2008 TAG for Celtic Sea cod was set at 4,316 tonnes under Council regulations.The need for a level playing field across the EU on fisheries control has been recognised as a national priority both by industry and by the Government.  We have consistently pushed at EU level for these controls.  Yesterday Commissioner Borg acknowledged that the issue has been raised with him by a number of other countries and Ministries.  On foot of the Court of Auditor findings, the Commission has prioritised control and has stated that it intends to review the regulatory regime, to put greater responsibility on member states and give itself stronger powers in this regard.  This is an extremely important issue from the Irish point of view.There is also the matter of administrative sanctions which was raised by the fishermen.  I recognise that fishermen would prefer a regime of administrative sanctions, as is the norm on the Continent.  The possibility of introducing administrative sanctions was comprehensively considered, including an examination of practices in other member states, at the time of the passage of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill through the Oireachtas.  The position taken at the time is well known.  It is an issue which is of considerable concern and worry to the FIF and the Department is examining it in so far as that can be done at this stage.National measures are being progressed to take account of the current difficulties being experienced by fishermen.  The current whitefish decommissioning scheme which aims to remove a large number of older trawlers from the whitefish fleet is of critical importance.  BIM's assessment of applications made under the €42 million decommissioning programme is nearing completion and letters of offer to eligible applicants will issue in the very near future.This strategy of restructuring the fleet in terms of capacity and efficiency is a key recommendation in line the Government's Cawley seafood development strategy.  It is also the cornerstone of the Commission's strategy which, while allowing for short-term emergency aid, continues to emphasise that this is a long-term matter and that medium to long-term restructuring of the fleet must be the priority.The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Smith, and I listened very carefully to issues raised by FIF at the two meetings we have had with it and there are several initiatives that we propose to take in the short term.  We are establishing the Irish seafood market initiative under the chair of Jason Whooley, CEO of BIM.  The remit of this initiative will be to discuss, identify and maximize the opportunities for domestic seafood supply to the Irish seafood market.  A second initiative to be taken is the Irish fisheries science research partnership which will be under the chairmanship of Dr. Peter Heffernan, CEO of the Marine Institute.  This will ensure that the huge amount of knowledge and information in the fishing industry will be taken account of and put into play, in conjunction with the tremendous work that the insititute and its scientists do on behalf of the industry in terms of conservation.The aim is to ensure there are stocks for future generations of fishermen as well as for those in the current fleets.  All the information available, from the fleet and its members and from the research people, can be brought together in a meaningful manner and used to influence policies adopted at EU level to the best possible outcome for Irish fishermen.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for being here for a critical debate at a critical time for the Irish fishing industry.  It is important that the House has an opportunity to address these issues before the meeting of the Council of Ministers in order to put down markers in respect of those important negotiations.  I am under no illusions and neither, I am sure, is the Minister, after his day-long meeting with the Federation of Irish Fishermen on what is expected in the outcome.I wish to read some of the content of an e-mail which I received from the wife of a fisherman.  More articulately than any of us could attempt, it summarises the plight of the fishing industry at the moment:Dear Michael,I am a fisherman's wife and I am writing to you to highlight the desperate situation we are all in that has led to our husbands having to stoop to the measures that they have over the past couple of days.  I don't have an agenda, I am just trying to save our livelihood, home etc.My husband has owned his own boat for the past 10 years, we remortgaged our home and took out a marine mortgage to buy the boat and have NEVER received a penny in grants or anything else from the State.  Up until the start of the year we were employing 5 men + my husband all of whom are completely tax compliant. . . We have had to cut this back to 4 due to our worsening financial position.My husband has a completely clear record, in 10 years he has never even been cautioned never mind committed an offence, Fishing is a stressful and dangerous job and stress is being added to profoundly by the inclusion of fisheries offences in the Criminal Justice Bill as a criminal offence.  The lads are living in dread of one of the inspectors finding some clerical error that could end with them with a criminal record.  The Dept of Marine regularly makes mistakes (we have gotten licenses with incorrect numbers on them etc.) that are just ignored but when the shoe is on the other foot it is a criminal offence!We haven't taken wages ourselves out of the boat for the past 3 months — the money just isn't there and the lads have seen their wages almost halved due to the high price of fuel.  The boat was at sea for 10 days on its last trip (240 hours away from family and friends for the crew) and for this they got 725 euro per man before tax — i.e. 3 euros per hour.. . .Someone made a dreadful mess of the quotas this year which has left a lot of the boats in a really bad way.  They left the cod quota open in January and February and boats that wouldn't normally land much cod landed hundreds of tonnes of very low quality cod which crashed the prices on the traditional cod fishermen and left little or no quota for the rest of the year.  We calculated the loss from dumping non-quota fish over the side and it worked out at €250 per man on the last trip.  When you are earning as little as these guys now are it must be soul destroying to look at that sort of money disappearing back over the side.  This mismanagement of the quota is a disgrace.Ireland has the largest share of European waters yet has the smallest most underdeveloped fleet and the least amount of quota of all the EU nations.The Government have also introduced a new safety survey that all boats have to undergo.  We [recently] attended a conference with the people who will be carrying out this survey on behalf of the Government and they gave an indication that even modern boats (less than 10 years old) would have to invest in excess of €100,000 to meet the very exacting standards that have been set for Irish boats . . . I don't know where they think that money is going to come from but I can tell you there isn't a bank in Ireland that will give a loan to a fishing boat at the moment.The e-mail outlines some of the demands with which the Minister is familiar.  They include demands for additional quota; a tie-up scheme similar to the set-aside scheme for farmers — that would work better than any quotas; an investment scheme from the Government in fuel-efficiency measures; a review of the criminal justice legislation to remove fishing offences and consider them as they are considered in other EU countries; a reduction in the duty on fuel; and a diversion of some of the effort being put into inspecting 100% of Irish vessels towards the inspection of foreign boats.  The correspondent concludes as follows: "Sorry this has been so long winded but at this stage I am desperate for someone to understand that we are not just being disruptive about the price of fuel — we are in real crisis!"  This correspondence summarises what is happening Irish fishermen on the high seas more eloquently than any I have seen to date.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I welcome this opportunity to address the crisis in the fishing industry in advance of next week's meeting of the Council of Ministers.  It is appropriate that an industry worth €750 million to the Irish economy and employing approximately 12,000 should be afforded proper political scrutiny and attention.  It is worth pointing out also that it is an industry located substantially, though not entirely, in geographically challenged locations for alternative industries.  If the fishing industry disappears in these areas, there will be few alternatives.The industry faces numerous challenges to its viability although, due to time restrictions, I will not elaborate on all of them.  They include diesel costs, quota restrictions, imports, falling fish prices, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the failure to brand and market Irish fish, illogical conservation measures to deal with by-catch, and a regulatory regime that is perceived to be heavy-handed and which is at variance with the EU norm.The unambiguous message that needs to go out from this debate is that, without a financial rescue package, the industry will collapse.  There is provision at EU level for this and the Minister will have to deliver on it in a very tight timeframe.  I do not want to hear talk of learning curves for Ministers new to their Departments.  If one is in the job, one is expected by fishermen to be on the job.I accept these negotiations are not straightforward.  In this context, a couple of markers must be put down.  It is preferable that the aid be EU derived.  However, protracted wrangling for months on end is not an option.  This must be decided next week at the meeting of the Council of Ministers.  If not, fishermen will simply go out of business.  If there is to be State aid, so be it.  Vigilance is necessary to ensure that Irish fishermen are not at a cost disadvantage in this regard vis-à-vis the French and Spanish, whose Exchequer pockets are deeper.  Payments per boat to the industry are needed now to stave off collapse and such payment must not detract from existing approval for State aid in the decommissioning process.The Cawley report is the accepted blueprint for the industry.  It would be appropriate at this time to ask its authors to carry out a review of the industry and its current state of health so the blueprint can be updated and revised to take account of the current crisis.With diesel prices increasing at an alarming rate, it needs to be noted that the Government is receiving a windfall financial gain it did not envisage at the beginning of the financial year.  The proceeds of up to 75% of catch are now spent on diesel costs in many instances.  This, allied to wage costs and stagnant or declining fish prices, means many cannot sustain the current losses indefinitely.One of the reasons for stagnant or falling fish prices is the dumping on the EU market of illegal, unreported and unregulated fish.  This matter is the subject of a report of the European Parliament adopted recently on 5 June 2008.  This report suggests that up to 50% of catch could fall into this category in the area of cod and tuna, for example.  The report deals in a comprehensive fashion with the problem, proposing a system of vessel identification, port control, certification of fish as legal, banning of imports from non-co-operating countries and inspection by EU states at a rate of 50% at ports where third country vessels dock.  The original percentage of inspections proposed was 15%.  The recommendations of the report should be implemented immediately.  If implemented, they will deliver an improved price to fishermen for their catch.  The report is a declared priority of the Slovenian EU Presidency.  Next week's meeting will probably be the final one under that Presidency and therefore the Minister should push strongly for the implementation of the recommendations.Conservation must be at the heart of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I understand — although, despite my best efforts, I cannot get confirmation from the Irish Marine Institute — that science now supports an increase in cod quota in the Celtic Sea.  If so, this needs to be delivered immediately.  If one takes into account the opening remarks on the management on cod quota this year, one will realise it makes it all the more urgent.The lunacy that obliges accidental catch to be discarded over board in the name of conservation must be ended.  I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister of State in this regard.  The practice of discarding in the North Atlantic 1.3 billion tonnes of fish is nothing short of immoral.  It may be dressed up as conservation but does not stand up to scrutiny in this regard.  The practice must be considered in light of the global switch from food production to bio-fuel production at a time of food shortages.  This requires immediate redress.  I am not suggesting for an instant that the European Union needs to dilute its commitment to appropriate conservation measures because this is what will ensure the survival of the industry in the longer term.  Conservation needs to be scientifically based but the dumping of fish stands up to no scrutiny whatever in the name of conservation.  It is practically immoral.A wide chasm now exists between the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, and the fishing community.  At the heart of this is the legislation that criminalises fishermen for offences that elsewhere in the Union are dealt with by way of administrative sanction.  A uniform approach to these issues is required across the Union.  More resources need to be devoted by the SFPA to boarding and inspecting foreign trawlers, which take over 80% of the catch from Irish waters.  The notion of shooting fish in a barrel comes to mind with regard to the disproportionate attention accorded to Irish fishermen in this regard.The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recently met representatives of the SFPA and members noted the authority is revising its service level with the Naval Service in terms of increased boardings of non-Irish trawlers.  The number of inspections needs to be significantly higher.  If 80% of the catch in Irish waters is being taken by foreign fleets, 80% of the boardings should be of those vessels.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	453	That is the proportionate response required.  If further resources are required by the Naval Service to achieve this, so be it.  The finger of suspicion points uneasily to the Irish fishing community.  Regrettably, advertising campaigns embarked upon by the SFPA wrongly strengthened the overall perception that there is a criminal element in the Irish fishing industry.  This is wholly wrong and undesirable.The figures the SFPA's representatives showed to the members of the committee suggest the level of compliance of Irish fishermen with the stringent and difficult regulations under the new regulatory regime is extremely high.  This message needs to be loud and clear.I have a specific question for the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, whom I presume will be responding to the debate.  Arising from last week's meeting in Athlone, the Minister announced two new initiatives, namely, a sea food marketing initiative and a new fisheries science research partnership, under the chairmanship of Mr. Jason Whooley of Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Dr. Peter Heffernan of the Marine Institute, respectively.  Will specific additional resources be made available to Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute to fund these initiatives or is this simply a figleaf for the Minister to wave in front of the Federation of Irish Fishermen as a way out of a difficult situation?  If the Minister is planning such initiatives on the cheap, they will not work.  While they are worthwhile, they need to be funded.
#PJSheenan	unknown-#PJSheenan-party	unknown-#PJSheenan-dob	unknown-#PJSheenan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael Creed, for sharing time.  I also congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with responsibility for fisheries and forestry, Deputy Tony Killeen.  I hope commonsense will prevail when they meet Commissioner Borg next week.  It is sad to reflect that this island nation does not receive preferential treatment because it is the only island nation in Europe that relies greatly on its marine industry.For years our stocks have been pilfered by foreign trawlers and all Irish fishermen seek is for commonsense to prevail and a level playing pitch as far as their European counterparts are concerned.  It is sad to reflect that hardworking Irish fishermen are criminalised and branded as criminals because they have a box or two of fish over and above the limit in their catch.  How can a fisherman control the number of fish that enter his or her trawl?  It is well-nigh impossible.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State, when meeting Commissioner Borg in Europe next week, to emphasise to him the plight our Irish fishermen are in through rising fuel costs, inadequate quotas and excessive surveillance by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  This famous authority was set up, mar dhea, to preserve the stocks in Ireland.  How can it do so when vast amounts of edible fish are dumped over the gunwales of the boats for the whales and whatever else to consume?Unless active consideration is given in Europe to our fishing industry, the day of pious words will butter no bread for Irish fishermen.  I ask the Minister, who is making his debut in Europe, to use his clout on behalf of Irish fishermen to ensure the continuation of a national industry that kept Ireland going down through the years.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12979	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I propose to share time with Deputies Tommy Broughan and Brendan Howlin, if I may.I received the same e-mail as Deputy Creed and I believe it has summed up the situation as it relates to a family that is completely reliant on fishing for its livelihood.  A husband and wife re-mortgaged a house to invest in a boat, employ a crew of five people and take to the seas.  In one instance, it spent ten days, or 240 hours, at sea for a return of €725 per man before tax.  Basically, they were earning €3 per hour.  Moreover, the same fishermen then are obliged to incur the stringent regulations applied by the authorities in Ireland, while French, Spanish and fishermen from other countries are looking on and laughing at the regime here.This pertains to realising that a group of people exists within our society who, because of climactic and bureaucratic conditions, incur serious losses of income.  However, they wish to sustain their livelihoods and their coastal communities because they have done so for generations.  As the lady who wrote the e-mail stated, when they hit bad times they want a leg up and not a handout.  Moreover, they do not wish to incur the bureaucratic nightmare that relates to fisheries policy.  However, they want to see put in place a realistic mechanism that would assist them through, if one pardons the pun, choppy waters.  During times when crewmen and women are not bringing in catches and their incomes are being seriously depleted — they are deemed to be self-employed —  they should not be obliged to go cap in hand to the local community welfare officer to beg to supplement their income.  A form of tax incentive or tax break could be put in place on the basis they are sustaining communities in coastal regions.  Moreover, the Government should consider a form of social welfare mechanism to assist such men and women on the basis that their income fluctuates between one end of the year and the other, that would not necessarily be breaking EU direct aid rules.I ask the Chair to let me know when I have spoken for four minutes.  I am anxious about the other Members——

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12979	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	457	In his contribution, the Minister of State told Members about the saga of illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, fishing and that the Luxembourg meeting will take place on 23 June.  Is the European Union serious about tackling the issue of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing?  Short of stating and acknowledging the problem, is the Government going into that meeting with a serious view on this problem?  It seems it is costing Irish and other European Union fishermen billions of euro annually because of the international nature of the problem.  This matter must be taken up at the WTO.  It must be taken up seriously at Irish level because it is taking food from the mouths of fishermen and is having an impact on a sector of our economy and society that could do very well, were this problem targeted in an effective manner.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I thank the Chair for providing Members with the opportunity to discuss this critical issue.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with responsibility for fisheries and forestry, Deputy Tony Killeen, are aware of my high opinion of both of them as representatives.  However, their performance on this matter in the past month has been incredibly disappointing and lethargic.  They must be far more proactive.I read today that President Sarkozy, without reference to the European Union, came forward with a package of measures worth more than €100 million for his fishing community, which is only about twice the size of ours.  Apparently President Sarkozy can come forward unilaterally with a major plan that does not run into problems on EU aids and that will be approved by the European Commission.  At the height of this crisis, when diesel prices went up in a matter of months, our Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food seemed to disappear.  We did not know who the Minister was or where he was.Like other colleagues, I have received very poignant complaints from many people over the last few weeks.  A young man, a neighbour of mine with three small children, has tried to run two boats and employed 12 men in Howth over the last few years, but he has been tied up for the last six weeks.  He does not know what is going to happen and does not know the future for himself, his family and his employees and their families.  That is a large community.  The Minister and Minister of State have to get real and become much more proactive about a very important area of our economy.I tried to raise this issue over the past few weeks by putting down parliamentary questions about it and raising it under Standing Order 32.  There have been rapidly dropping returns on wages, in some cases to virtually nothing, and there is a total despair gripping communities along the coast, be they in Greencastle, Burtonport, Rossaveal, Dingle, Castletownbere, Union Hall, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Clogherhead or Howth.  They are not happy with what they have heard from the European Union, which was essentially a pig in a poke, with no cast iron assurances on funding for tie ups or supports for the marketing of the industry.Last year we saw the publication of the Cawley report, and it is true that we needed to set a new course.  We needed to be much more proactive.  As people from the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation said to me so often, we wanted to look at our fishing industry and our coastal communities as a sunrise situation and not a sunset.  We do not want to look at it as the tail of the dog and the industry that can be safely ignored.  The Cawley report suggested a €600 million investment in the industry for marketing and other assists, as well as decommissioning supports in areas where there was over-fishing.  However, we are still waiting for that.I welcome the fact Mr. Jason Whooley has been appointed to head a new organisation to deal with all this, but we have had examples of similar organisations for a long time, such as Seafood Scotland.  We have had very little action from this Government on the issue.  One of the reasons the Government deserved not to be re-elected was its horrendous treatment of the fishing industry over the last four or five years.The skyrocketing increase in fuel prices is unprecedented.  Representatives of Gazprom have spoken about €250 per barrel.  We need to see some action on fuel duties and supports for fuels to ensure the whole fleet does not end up being tied up for good.  We have had problems with the high levels of imported fish from south-east Asia and Africa, as well as problems with the Spanish and the French fleets.  The price fishermen receive is just a fraction of the price the consumer pays at the end of the day.  We had the debate last week on Europe, and I am one of those who still believes we need to examine the Common Fisheries Policy.  I support colleagues who stated that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority seems to be able to target Irish boats and fishermen very easily and effectively ignore other boats.  That was put on the record of the last Dáil when the Commodore of the Naval Service came before the joint committee.  It seemed to be a question of picking on our own because they were so much easier to track down, while the foreigners could do what they liked.We need an urgent set of measures and we need to get real.  The Minister and the Minister of State should announce a strong and supportive programme, otherwise we will soon have no fishing industry.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I am grateful to my colleagues for allowing me to speak on an issue that is of profound importance to this country, especially to the people of its coastal areas.  I want to speak on behalf of my community in County Wexford, especially the fishing village of Kilmore Quay and right across the southern coast to Ballyhack and other places.It is clear that Ireland has had an extraordinary boom over the last 15 to 20 years.  Most sectors of our community have blossomed and thrived in that period.  There are colder winds now and there is belt tightening and anxiety.  However, what is happening to the fishing industry and to fishing communities is unprecedented in my time in this House.  I have never seen the devastation of a whole community as I have witnessed recently.  Problems are now arising for hard working people who take their lives in their hands to provide this nation with fish.  They cannot simply earn a living at present.  What has happened is immoral and wrong and a number of things need to be done.I have the greatest respect for the newly appointed Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but the truth is that agriculture is a full-time job.  We need a Cabinet rank marine Minister to recognise the scale of the issues to be addressed in our coastal zones and find solutions.  It is not good enough to say the pass was sold in the early 1970s.  The deal we got when joining the Common Market in 1972 did not focus on fisheries.  We put all our eggs in the basket of agriculture, while the fisheries industry was abandoned.  We got a bad deal for fisheries back then, but we need a decent deal now if those communities are to survive.It has been said the fuel issue is the last straw, which it is.  However, fishermen know they cannot make a living from fishing under the current regime.  The notion of catching fish, letting it die on board and then dumping it for fear of being pursued by a fisheries inspector for a criminal offence is unconscionable.  It does not happen elsewhere and it should not happen in this country.We need to have a Cabinet ranked Minister for fisheries.  We need a clear plan to help people who are desperate right now.  I spoke to a fisherman in my constituency when I was canvassing for the Lisbon treaty.  He showed me coal in the boot of his car that he trawled up while fishing and told me that he brings it home to put on the fire in order to save money on fuel.  That is the extent of the pressure.  I am dealing with banks about the foreclosure of mortgages and I am dealing with people who cannot pay their ESB bills.  I hope the Minister and the Minister of State understand that of all the people under pressure right now in Ireland, none is under greater pressure than the fishing communities.  The House needs to show solidarity with them through taking exceptional measures that I hope will flow from this debate.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	460	While the factor that has led to the current crisis in fishing and the decision to hold this debate is the impact of fuel cost increases, it is in reality the culmination of 35 years of deliberate mismanagement and neglect.  Nor is it a coincidence that attention is being paid to this issue a week after the Irish people voted to reject any further surrender of power over our affairs to Brussels.  If there was ever an example of an aspect of Irish life that has suffered from EU bureaucracy, it is the fishing sector.  That was not lost by Irish coastal communities when they went to vote last Thursday.  All our coastal communities in Kerry, Mayo, Galway, Donegal, north-east Dublin, Louth, Wexford, Waterford and west Cork decisively rejected the treaty.We have recently seen Irish fishermen engaged in a series of protests from handing out free fish to massing in the bigger ports.  The actions of people who are at the end of their tether and for whom the 40% increase in fuel costs, which means that many of them are operating at a loss, threatens to be the straw that breaks the camel's back.  I commend the fishermen right across this island on their courage, determination and reasonableness.  They did not embark lightly on the decision to block the ports, but they did it in a very respectful manner and allowed the Government an opportunity to negotiate to try to alleviate the situation.However, this is only one in a long series of straws.  Irish fishermen have been driven to the wall by successive attempts to scale down the sector here by all sorts of means, which are increasingly restrictive and unpredictable.  The quota has been cut, the number of fishing days was reduced and legislation was introduced to criminalise fishermen despite the overwhelming opposition of the fisheries committee.  All this added to the perception that the weight of the policing of fisheries has fallen on Irish fishermen rather than foreign fleets.  That is encapsulated in the fact that Irish fishermen were arriving back to port to be inspected by shore based fisheries staff who until recently had not the means to go to sea to monitor foreign boats.  This is akin to a supermarket employing security staff to wait outside someone's house until he or she comes home with the shopping while giving the shoplifters free range.Someone remarked recently on the popularity of small fish in Spain where they are considered a great delicacy.  These are fish that could only have been caught illegally within EU waters.  It hardly takes a genius to figure out where many if not most of these illegal catches come from.  More than all these things, which are merely the straws threatening to break the camel's back, the current crisis is the direct result of decades of mismanagement and neglect, dating from the surrender of our fisheries to Brussels in 1973.We have heard much about what we have received from the EU in CAP and Structural Fund payments but very little of the fact that other EU states have taken much more than that in the value of fish taken from Irish waters and more importantly the loss to the Irish economy this represents.  The 2004 estimate of the catch by the Irish fleet in waters around our coast indicated that it amounted to 15% of total fish caught.  Within the area under EU jurisdiction it was only 28%.  It is the equivalent of having 85% of our agricultural land in the hands of foreign landowners who export it raw to their own countries without one cent of benefit to the Irish people, a situation that pertained in Ireland with land until the Land War of the 1880s forced them off the backs of the Irish people.  In the same year it was estimated by the Marine Institute that the value of the catch in surrounding waters was €800 million, of which €460 million was taken in the EU zone.  The institute stated, however, that the value of international landings was most likely an underestimate.  Indeed, it could be more accurately described as a guess.Combined with the fact that this does not take into account the level of illegal fishing by foreign vessels, believed to be at least a third of the legal catch, and the fact that by 2004 the level of fishing had shown a steep decline from earlier years, we are talking about billions of euro of fish in today's values being taken from our waters by non-Irish vessels.  That is only the unprocessed value and does not take into account the value and opportunities lost to a domestic processing and export sector had successive Governments since the foundation of the State not neglected the fishing industry and then surrendered it to Brussels.There are no reliable figures, not least because very few want to face up to the grim reality.  In 2004, however, the EU's statistical agency EUROSTAT, provided figures that showed that the accumulated processed value of fish taken in Irish waters between 1974 and 2004 was approximately €200 billion.  In the same period we received €40 billion in total transfer funds, including CAP and Structural Fund payments.Some 40% of edible fish within the EU is caught in Irish waters and Irish fishermen are entitled to catch only a small proportion of that.  What sense does that make?  Lest anyone think that Sinn Féin and others have only being saying this of late, we made the same point in 1972 and indeed it was discussed in the United Irishman newspaper in the early 1960s when the vast potential offered by the fishing industry was pointed out.  There is a marked difference between the neglect of the industry here and  how the Norwegians built a thriving economy on fisheries before they discovered oil.  While they were building a thriving domestic processing and export industry and turning what was regarded as one of the most underdeveloped countries in Europe into a prosperous nation, we were failing to invest or include fishing as part of the plans for economic development.Then when its value was recognised by EU bureaucrats, when Ireland was in the process of joining the EEC  in the early 1970s, someone decided it would be a good idea to basically hand it over.  On RTE's "Seascapes" website there is an interesting report on the programme maker's visit to Spain:The extent of their fishing/seafood industry shows what we have lost by the inane stupidity of successive Irish Governments.  The most culpable are those who negotiated away our fishing rights and on whom a heavy burden of blame should rest.  We have lost economically and socially as a result.We are paying the price to the present day.  Maybe at last we will recognise this, something that is privately admitted even by officials within the sector, and demand that the disastrous Common Fisheries Policy is completely overhauled.  If it is not and if we are content to allow the EU to dictate the future of our fisheries, all that awaits the industry is a slow death.  If the Government is merely going to tinker around and hope that a temporary solution to the current crisis can be averted, it would do just as well to allow the fuel costs to take their toll and let the fishermen go to the wall because that is the inevitable consequence of the way the sector is being managed at the present time.I want, also, to refer to the huge anger that exists among fishermen and their families, and indeed the entire coastal communities, regarding attempts to criminalise them.  An entire section of the Criminal Justice Act is devoted to fishermen.  It includes sections allowing fisheries protection officers to enter private homes and seize documents and computers.  No other profession or trade in the State has been given such attention.  This is a State where unregulated private airports and private aeroplanes have been at the centre of massive drug importations.  It is good to see that the former Minister had his priorities right.If that was not sufficient, the former Minister used the word "traitors" to describe those he claimed were the target of the legislation.  In reality, the only traitors in the true sense of the word were those who bargained and sold our fisheries in 1972.  They betrayed Irish fishermen and the Irish people.In 2006 we had the Sea Fisheries Bill which introduced criminal penalties on fishermen. It was opposed in this Chamber and in committee by Deputies on all sides, but of course Government Deputies and  the Independents who supported them meekly supported the Bill when it came to a vote.  A shameful act was done by Members of this House and the Sea Fisheries Bill in criminalising decent hard-working people who risk their lives on a daily basis for their communities and families.The demonisation and criminalisation was wrong.  We argued on Committee Stage and in the Chamber that ministerial sanction was the way to go for lighter offences.  However, the then Minister decided he was going to have his way and proceeded with this form of criminalisation.In the Minister of State's speech he mentioned the objectives of the producers, fishermen, wholesalers, distributors and processors to ensure the markets supplied are fully aware of the communities from which Irish fishermen supply the domestic market, and I welcome that.  We need to see the unification of all sectors, not just fishermen and producers.  By doing this, we can maximise the value of catches to fishermen and control seafood imports that are undermining our native industry.  I have been informed reliably that scallops from Peru are being imported every week through Cork Airport.  This use of Ireland as a backdoor into the EU means these scallops are being sold as Irish with no labelling to suggest the opposite.The Minister referred to decommissioning of the fishing fleet which I believe is a terrible indictment of the State.  People are being put out of their livelihoods, not just the boat-owners but the skippers and the crews.  Decommissioning will mean nothing to the skippers and crews.  They will be dependent on the boat-owner as to whether they receive any compensation.  Many of these men have been fishing since they were 20 years of age.  They now find themselves in their 60s, knowing no other skill but fishing.  They will receive no redundancy package or any compensation.  I hope the Minister will not forget this aspect.The kernel of the problem in the fishing sector is the lack of an adequate quota.  There is no political will to tackle the EU to gain a sufficient quota to enable our fishing industry to survive and prosper.  I am not satisfied enough is being done in that regard.  It is to easy to claim it cannot be renegotiated but it can be, the very same as we will renegotiate the Lisbon treaty.  If we do not, what is left of our coastal communities will be destroyed.  They were once vibrant communities but now they are in a most depressed state.It took guts and courage for the fishing sector to blockade the ports recently to secure a debate in the Dáil.  These statements would not have been taken if the fishermen had not done so.  I applaud them for it.  I stand with them because they have taken the right approach to getting a meeting with the Minister and Minister of State.  I hope the fishermen will not have to blockade ports again to get justice.  They are entitled to justice, the same as anyone else.  They were betrayed and sold out by the State and the then Government in 1973 when Ireland entered the EEC.  Their industry was compromised for other interests.  They deserve the recognition and entitlements that every other citizen enjoys.

#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I am glad to have the opportunity to address the crisis faced by the fishermen of Ireland, and of my county, Wexford.  On 19 May I was invited to a public meeting at Kilmore Quay with more than 40 fishermen and fisherwomen to discuss the biggest crisis they have ever faced.  Several issues were brought to my attention.The fishermen are concerned with the price of fuel which makes it impossible to cover fleet expenses.  Fuel costs have increased by over 320% in the past five years, 40% alone since January.  They ask for the Common Fisheries Policy to be urgently reviewed to allow proper management of Irish fisheries.  The CFP, they claim, has not protected our waters and is most harsh on Irish fishermen who have unworkable quotas.  The EU allows fish to be imported into its market while we cannot sell our own.They want the repeal of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 which makes criminals of fishermen for fisheries offences.  They also want the over-policing and over-regulation of the industry by the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the Naval Service, while foreign vessels, according to them, fish unhindered, to be examined.  The final issue they raised concerned decommissioning of trawlers and what it will mean for fishermen who are not boat-owners.  What packages will be made available to them?At the meeting I was given an example of the square-up.  The majority of fishermen are share fishermen, meaning their wages are based on the share of the catch landed.  The square-up system awards skippers and crew who do well with catches.  However, it can vary wildly; if a boat does not go to sea, there are no wages.In 2004, the landing of 235 boxes of fish from seven days at sea would be valued at €25,986.  From this the crew would share 41%, which came to €7,000.  The skipper cleared €1,615; the deckhands, €1,000.  If this is compared with today's prices, the equivalent catch would yield €20,741 with the crew's share reduced to €2,419.  This would leave the skipper and the deck-hands with a third of their 2004 income, €559 and €372, respectively.  No family can sustain themselves, let alone pay a mortgage, on that level of income.  This is a wage earned after spending seven days at sea.The Kilmore Quay fishermen also raised the discard.  With half the world starving, discarding catches is a scandal, raising moral questions.  I cannot understand why fishermen cannot land the discard and log it.  The Ministers could address this in their meetings with our European colleagues.Deputy Broughan made a blatant attack on the recently appointed Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  I, however, commend them and acknowledge their, and their predecessors, efforts.  Following my meeting in Kilmore Quay on 19 May, on 21 May a meeting, chaired by the Acting Chairman, was held in Agriculture House where these issues were raised.  A special meeting was convened for the following week.  On 28 May, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority was brought before the Oireachtas committee.  The following day, 29 May, a special meeting was held between the two Ministers and the Federation of Irish Fishermen.  Two weeks later a subsequent nine-hour meeting was held.  Both Ministers attended a European Summit meeting in Strasbourg yesterday.  These are commendable efforts.It is important the House fully supports them in their efforts to deliver a vital deal for our fishermen to ensure the industry's survival.  I wish them every success in their ongoing work to protect and grow the Irish fishing industry.  I ask them to address the difficulties over which Ireland has control.  It must also include the implementation of the national strategic plan, an amendment to Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 and dedicated funding for our coastal communities.  At a time of crisis in the fishing industry, we must stand with our fishermen, their families and communities to ensure the survival of this much-needed industry for Ireland.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	464	As an island, our nation's character is defined by our relationship with the sea.  Fishing in our coastal communities is an integral part of our island and community life.  Members have spoken of the battering the fishermen have taken for some time.  I endorse Deputy Connick's comments on the efforts made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, since they were appointed.  It must also be acknowledged their predecessors laid much of the groundwork for them.  The time they have given to this issue, particularly considering how recently they were appointed, is a good sign.  The ministerial team will have my full support.The issues have been dealt with but we must identify solutions.  It is unbelievable that in these times of healthy eating the promotion of fish as a health food is slipping.  The marketing fund for fish promotion needs to be increased.  We need to change whatever rules on branding need to be changed and we need to sell the benefits of fish as a health food.  We need to ensure people realise the fish they are buying comes from Irish waters, is healthy and is supporting local communities.  The increase in the number of organic markets around the country is testimony that people are willing to support local produce.  With proper branding, there is no reason Irish wild seafood should not be popular.The functions of the protection agency need to be reviewed or at least the manner in which it carries out those functions.  The agency gives an impression of authority and arrogance and this was addressed at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food a few weeks ago.  At a time when there are so many other pressures on fishermen, we could do without such an attitude.  The agency needs to adopt a more co-operative attitude when dealing with fishing communities.The recent announcement by the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, of the new rural investment fund which will be expended through the Leader programme, is timely.  As Leader plans are currently being finalised around the country, specific attention should be given to fishing communities in relevant Leader plans and funding should be targeted specifically at those communities.  Investment could be targeted at infrastructure, retraining, marketing or tourism promotion.  It would be a shame if in the current climate the opportunity to influence those Leader plans were to be lost.  I ask that the Ministers engage with Deputy Ó Cuív's Department and with the local development companies around the country to ensure such attention.The former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan, initiated a review of the 2006 legislation which has caused so much anger and hurt in the fishing communities.  They are being branded as criminals for doing a job that comes naturally to them.  We need to complete that review as soon as possible and ensure the issues are dealt with while still retaining laws to protect the fishermen from their more dodgy colleagues, as it were.There are still issues associated with the taxation of the drift-net scheme.  Those issues have been accentuated in light of the different taxation treatment of the decommissioning scheme.  Fishermen who had no option but to give up drift-net fishing for salmon were taxed on the compensation and some have yet to be advised on the applicable rate.  I ask that attention be paid to this issue and to communicating with people.  We are in the tax year in which money is due to be paid on the drift-net scheme.As Deputy after Deputy has said, it is absolutely criminal in this day of food shortages and starvation that the discard scheme is allowed to continue.  Deputy Connick's solution which is to allow them to land that fish and log it as discard but allow it into the food chain, is necessary.  It is even more ludicrous that we have to ask for this to be done in this day and age.I wish the Ministers well next week.  Their work to date will stand to them.  I hope the decisions made last week will not hinder that work in finding a good deal for Irish fishermen.  I have complete faith in their ability to do so.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I wish to share time with Deputy McHugh.This is the first time I have heard it stated that the €42 million for decommissioning was "wholly inadequate".  The Minister's predecessor was glorying in the fact that €42 million had been set aside for decommissioning and the current Minister has admitted this amount is wholly inadequate.  I agree with the Minister that the amount is wholly inadequate.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong but I am led to believe his initial discussions with Europe regarding putting a package together for the fishermen has proven far from successful.  Deputy Broughan noted that the French ministry has put €100 million into a fund for its fishing industry.  I understand the Minister has been advised by Europe that he can put a fund in place but from his own resources and not from Europe.  I hope I am wrong but if I am correct I hope the Minister will take it upon himself to put the fund in place for fishermen.Many issues need to be dealt with for the long-term survival of the fishing industry.  We need to sort out the fishing industry now because the long-term viability of the fishing industry will not be an issue in a matter of months because it will be gone.  The tie-up is the only solution package that could be put in place to help fishermen immediately.  Illegal, unreported, unregulated fishing off the Irish and Scottish coasts has a value of €7 billion, an unbelievable figure, considering the world-wide figure is supposed to be €10 billion.The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority attended a recent meeting of the joint committee.  Its budget is €15 million and it has 70 staff.  I asked the delegation that day whether the authority had a boat.  They answered that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority did not have a boat.  They wait on the shore.  I describe them as they were described to me by fishermen, as Ninjas.  A fishermen docked at port one evening and four fisheries officers from the authority ganged up on him.  He described them as Ninjas.  Each had their own four-wheel drive vehicle but they do not have a boat to go out and catch anyone fishing illegally on our shores.  They leave that to the Naval Service.  When I asked them how many boats had they boarded, they did not answer.  I suspect they did not board any boats which the Naval Service had boarded.Several Deputies referred to discards.  The figure of anywhere from 31% to 90% discards in the west of Ireland and Scotland is crazy.  A communication on discards was adopted in 2007.  This was a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and discards in European fisheries.  What were the consequences of this policy?Licensing is an issue that needs to be resolved sooner rather than later.  I also refer to labelling of Irish fish products.  I support the Acting Chairman's call in his contribution for a dedicated Front Bench senior Minister for fisheries.  Currently, the fisheries brief is spread over three Departments.  I suggest it be co-ordinated under one senior ministry to ensure a secure, long-term industry.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I welcome both Ministers and the Department officials.  This discussion and its timing are  of critical importance as the industry continues to fight against the tide, if I may be excused the pun, of negativity and disillusionment throughout the industry.The e-mail to which Deputies Creed and Sherlock referred encapsulated a plethora of issues within the industry.  If there is one element which stabs at the heart of the fishing industry, it is the criminalisation of the industry.  If the Minister has sat in a room for nine hours with fishermen, this issue would have been at the forefront of discussion.  People in the industry do not want to be condoning the fact they want to break laws but they want addressed the simple matter of a fisherman who fails to register a catch by making a telephone call upon entering a port who can be taken to court the following morning.  That is an example of how extreme and disastrous is the scheme.  Criminalisation stabs the industry in the heart.  This issue must be addressed and it can be addressed in national legislation.Ireland has 25% of EU waters.  We have got consistently bad deals from Europe.  I will not take this opportunity to make recriminations, apportion blame or remember when mistakes were made.  Despite Ireland having 25% of EU waters, when I go to restaurants in Donegal proprietors tell me they do not know if fish will be available to them in the long term.  In coastal areas restaurateurs are fearful of being unable to maintain fish on their menus.  That is a disgrace.We must expedite the €20 million tie-up scheme.  We must also be very cautious regarding the mistakes we made with regard to the decommissioning scheme.  Deckhands, skippers and mates were not included in the decommissioning scheme.  If there is to be a tie-up scheme we must ensure that they are included in the package.A sea fisheries Bill is proposed for 2008.  We have an opportunity to retrain fishermen, deckhands, skippers and first mates and make them officers of the merchant navy.  I accept that this does not come within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and crosses to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Nevertheless, some interdepartmental initiative must deal with the retraining of fishermen who are currently idle.I welcome the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister of State are taking this matter seriously and that the Minister, Deputy Smith, is in the House for this debate on a Thursday afternoon with the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  Deputies on the Government side have referred to the good work the Minister and Minister of State are doing.  However, we have made a fundamental mistake with regard to the fishing community.  The lack of political leadership has allowed a vacuum to develop.  While I do not propose to take a swipe at departmental officials, fishermen have felt that the Department has been running the fishing industry for the past decade.  This is not good enough.  The fishing industry requires political leadership and accountability to fishermen.  A single person must take charge of the industry, which has been rocked to the core for a decade.  I ask the Minister to continue with what he is doing.  Coastal communities need guidance and they need someone to take charge.  This has been missing for many years.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	467	The mere fact that we are meeting today, giving Deputies from all sides an opportunity to take part in the debate, is an indication of the seriousness of the situation in which the fishing industry finds itself.  The Minister and Minister of State, shortly after their appointment, met the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, and made themselves fully au fait with the difficulties.  The fact that they met in Athlone for nine hours demonstrates how seriously both sides view the situation.I would like to talk about the long-term future of the industry.  However, we do not have time for that today, nor does the industry have time.  If we do not overcome the short-term issues we will not need to think about the industry in the long term.  I will not spend time talking about the national development plan and the €42 million it allocates to the fishing industry.  There will be no necessity to spend much of that money, aside from decommissioning, if we do not deal with the short-term problems.I indicated my views on the important issues to the Minister some weeks ago.  We should avail of the temporary tie-up aid, which is provided for in the European Fisheries Fund.  We need a major initiative to increase the price of fish, controls on fish coming from outside the EU and marketing regulation.People from Donegal and other maritime counties realise more than most the importance of the fishing industry because coastal areas have no alternative source of employment.  The issue of drift-net fishing should be revisited.I am glad the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 has been mentioned.  I hope I will be proven right in my view that it is ludicrous to bring criminal charges for minor offences.  We often blame Brussels but in this case Brussels tells us we should have administrative sanctions.  However, a change in this legislation would not alleviate the serious situation in which we find ourselves.  The issues of discards and administrative sanctions must be dealt with.I compliment the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  I believe the full support of all Members will go with them to the Council of Ministers next week.  I hope they will be successful.  Commissioner Borg is a reasonable man, coming from the small island of Malta.  I wish the Minister and Minister of State well and thank them for the interest they are taking in this matter.  We will all, and particularly those involved in the fishing industry, anxiously await their return.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I thank all Members who contributed to this debate on the very important issues facing the fishing sector and who made positive contributions, including yourself, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.One of the very strong messages from the debate is that discards are a huge problem.  The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen set down, in detail, the complex issues surrounding this issue, which is global.  Yesterday, we had detailed discussions with the Commissioner.  I am convinced he is committed to finding a solution and the Minister of State and I are committed to working with the industry, Commissioner Borg and other member states to press ahead with the agreed action plan adopted by the EU Fisheries Commission in June 2007.Deputy Creed referred to the mismanagement of fish quotas.  Quotas are managed with the involvement of the fishing industry.  For white fish quotas, the Department meets the industry every month and the industry recommends a quota regime for the following month.  Industry recommendations are implemented at least 95% of the time.  The industry decides when quotas are caught and how much can be caught.  These are the people who have the knowledge and experience to make these decisions.  For small quotas, the industry must decide whether to allow a by-catch during the year or a directed fishery when markets are strong.  This is not an easy choice but the industry must make decisions.  This year, the industry decided on a relatively open fishery for the early part of the year and we are facing closures now.  However, we must be advised by the industry.  I want to continue with that regime.The two initiatives on markets for research announced by the Minister of State are very important and have been welcomed by the industry.  Both an Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Marine Institute have substantial budgets.  In the Estimates, the agencies are given an over all grant and, like all State agencies, must decide priorities.  These two initiatives are, clearly, priorities and we expect that any resources needed will be prioritised by the agencies.  However, in both cases much of the work needed will not cost money.  On marketing initiatives, the main issue is to get vessel owners, wholesalers, processors and retailers working together to co-ordinate and support their joint activities and maximise the returns for all.The research partnership is exactly that.  We need better science, and the involvement of fishermen will achieve this.  One of the messages coming to us is that the huge resource of knowledge which is in the fishing community is not often reflected in scientific analysis.  Working together is very important.Deputy McHugh raised the issue of training crew for the merchant navy and the impact of decommissioning on crew members.  He suggested that crew should be retrained to allow them to take jobs in the merchant navy.  BIM is working with the marine survey office of the Department of Transport to ensure fishermen and skippers have the best possible opportunities to transfer into the merchant navy.I believe Deputy Tom Sheahan, in his introductory remarks, took the Minister of State up wrongly.  Deputy Killeen did not say that €42 million is inadequate for decommissioning.  This provision will suffice to meet most of the current demand from eligible applicants for decommissioning.  What the Minister of State said was that the total allocation to Ireland from the European fisheries fund for the period 2007 to 2013 is inadequate.  This is a completely different point and one which needs to be clarified.  We raised this issue with the Commissioner in strong terms yesterday.Deputies referred to cod in the Celtic Sea.  Earlier this year, the research institutes of France, Britain and Ireland made a scientific submission to the European Commission advising that the scientific state of the stock was sufficient to justify an increase in the catch.  The consideration of the scientific submission did not reach the same conclusion and the issue has been the subject of ongoing bilateral discussions with the Commission.  We raised this issue as a priority at yesterday's meeting and the Commissioner has undertaken to come back to us following consultation with his scientific experts and working with the data Britain, France and Ireland submitted to the Commission.We are conscious of the serious difficulties facing the fishing sector.  We know from Deputies, including members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party with whom we speak regularly, and from our meetings with the Federation of Irish Fishermen and individual members of the fishing community that the sector faces serious issues.  I assure the House that the Government, through me, the Minister of State and our officials, is determined to work with the industry to overcome these difficulties.  We want to build a sustainable industry which will continue to provide worthwhile employment.Deputy Howlin and other Members put the issue of discards in colourful terms.  There is something wrong when good food is being dumped instead of being put to good use by people.  While this is a complicated issue, it is one we firmly placed on the agenda when we informed Commissioner Borg that we want radical improvements made in this area.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I share the Deputy's concern about increases in the price of goods and services.  The greater part of these increases reflect global trends over which the Government has little or no control.  Approximately 60% of the rise in the consumer price index in the year to May 2008 was attributable to rises in the price of fuels, food and mortgage interest rates.A comparison of our inflation performance with that of other EU member states underlines the extent to which rising prices here reflect international pressures.  Official figures recently released by EUROSTAT show that, measured on a harmonised basis, our inflation rate of 3.7% in the year to May 2008 was identical to the average for the euro area and below the average of 3.9% for the European Union as a whole.  Only three member states in the euro area and a further two member states outside the euro area had a lower annual inflation rate over this period.While Government has little power to influence the main causes of recent increases in the price of food and fuel, I have taken action in areas where we can be in a position to exert some influence.  In recent weeks, I have met separately with IBEC and leading members of Retail Ireland and have also written to major individual retailers to express the Government's concern at the apparent reluctance of the retail sector generally to pass on to consumers the benefit of the euro's appreciation against sterling.  I was told at these meetings that, while the retail price of goods imported from the United Kingdom had lagged exchange rate movements due to factors such as the forward purchase of goods and currency, there had already been reductions in the price of some goods and further reductions were in the pipeline.The consumer price index data for the month of May 2008 confirm that there have been modest reductions in the price of a number of goods, such as breakfast cereals and biscuits, known to have a significant UK import content.  I intend to continue my engagement with the retail sector in the period ahead with a view to securing a satisfactory outcome for Irish consumers.I have also met the National Consumer Agency on this issue.  As a result of these discussions, the agency is undertaking further price surveys, including the survey published yesterday which compared the prices of a range of branded and own brand goods in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The findings of the survey amply demonstrate the need for a more competitive retail marketplace in the Republic.  The publication of more regular and more comprehensive price information by the National Consumer Agency and a willingness by consumers to act on that information have a key role to play in the development of a more competitive marketplace.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	470	Deputies will be aware of widespread consumer anger about the price of goods and the growing fear of those on tight budgets.  While I am not on a particularly tight budget, I returned from my local Spar outlet the other day having paid almost €100 for a basket of goods which had very little in it.  I appreciate the Minister earns €5,000 per week and probably has her driver do her shopping, but rising prices are beginning to hurt.Yesterday, the National Consumer Agency published an interesting price survey which showed that when VAT and excise are excluded, Tesco own brand prices are 17% higher in the Republic than in the North, whereas the difference between branded items is 28%.  While it may be possible to attribute the difference of 17% to higher operating costs in the Republic, one cannot justify a price differential of 28%.  In the case of Dunnes Stores, own brand goods in the South cost 11% more than in the North, while branded items cost 31% more, indicating an unjustified mark-up of 20%.Surveys carried out by political parties, newspapers and the National Consumer Agency have provided sufficient evidence of the problem.  The time for analysis is over and the time for action is upon us.  We know from the independent survey published by the National Consumer Agency that prices for branded goods are more or less the same across supermarkets.  Does the Minister accept that her advice to shop around is rubbish?The Minister's statement that she met representatives of Retail Ireland and IBEC indicates she met press officers or policy officers.  Who did she meet from Tesco, Lidl and Dunnes Stores?  When did she meet them and what did she say to them?

If I receive €5,000 per week, I would like to see the job I do because I do not receive that sum.I take the issue of price increases seriously.  It is also a serious issue for consumers and it was on that basis that I took action.  I will continue to vigorously pursue issues of major importance to consumers.  As Deputy Varadkar will be aware, many retailers in the Republic are involved in price tracking.  Serious issues have arisen in comparative analyses between North and South and I will continue to pursue these vigorously.I met the director general of IBEC and those within IBEC who are in charge of Retail Ireland.  I then met Retail Ireland, which is made up of the largest retailers in the country as well as some small retailers.  As the Deputy will be aware, Dunnes Stores is not part of Retail Ireland.  I met the chief executive of Tesco as well as many other chief executives and those from the UK who made themselves available.  I met senior management within all the groups.  During our discussions both sides showed an appreciation that there are issues.  We have seen modest reductions in some prices in recent weeks, as one would note if one tracked prices in newspaper articles or shops.To ensure full transparency on the issue of the cost of doing business, I have asked Forfás to carry out a comparative analysis of the costs of business, North and South.  This issue was raised by the retail companies.  When one strips out most of the price differentials the National Consumer Agency found in the study it carried out on my behalf, one finds that the cost of doing business, North and South, is not necessarily an indicator of the real reasons.The sterling differential must be passed on to consumers.Equally, as a Deputy from a Border county, I wish to ensure that we have a strong retail sector in the South.  It is incumbent on us all to ensure that happens and that people who are involved and working in that sector are assured of sustainable jobs.  There is a need for a little patriotism in this country.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.The most recent figures published by the Department of Social and Family Affairs show that there were 201,756 persons on the live register in May.  However, it is important to remember that the live register is not a measure of unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who might be signing on from time to time.Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey, collated and published by the CSO.  The current rate of unemployment is 4.6% or 102,100 people in quarter 1, December to February 2008.  This reflects an increase of 8,700 in the year.The increase in unemployment was not unexpected, particularly in the context of the slowdown in the construction industry.  It is generally accepted that the strong rate of growth experienced over the past few years could not continue and the economy is now entering a period of adjustment.However, this increase in unemployment must be seen in the context of the substantial increase in employment by 224,300 in the three-year period since 2005.  This compares with an unemployment increase of 19,500 in the same period.  The number of people currently in employment is 2,135,100 and employment has increased by 53,800 or 2.6% in the past 12 months.The employment market still has job vacancies.  The most recent FÁS-ESRI employment and vacancies survey for April 2008 shows that 7% of firms are reporting vacancies.In the budget projection, published by the Department of Finance last December, unemployment was forecast to average at about 5.5% over the period 2008 to 2010.  Employment was forecast to continue to grow this year by about 24,000.  Some other economists are still forecasting this level of employment growth.  For example, following publication of the quarterly national household survey on 5 June last, Bloxhams revised its 2008 forecast from no net change in employment this year to an average rise of 25,000.  The Department of Finance will publish a revised forecast in its pre-budget outlook in October.As regards the economic situation and the impact on the labour market, the focus is now on flexibility in the delivery of employment and training programmes so that those who are affected by the slowdown and by unemployment can be assisted appropriately and in good time.After three months on the live register those who are still unemployed are referred by Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS to assist them into training or employment.  FÁS is working through its own employment service and with the local employment service provided by area based partnerships to provide increased interviewing and caseload management capacity to respond to the increased numbers on the live register.  The range of integrated support services provided by FÁS also involves information sessions, skills analysis, training/retraining courses and job placement.  These services will be available for those who become redundant because of company restructuring or closures.Specifically, FÁS is implementing a range of short and medium term actions for those affected by the increase in unemployment and the construction slowdown, such as: putting in place training to upskill construction workers in emerging needs; business training and mentoring for workers from larger enterprises entering self-employment; developing measures to ensure continuity in the apprenticeship system; and promoting access for mobile workers to construction jobs elsewhere in the EU, including the UK.FÁS is also working on increasing its market share of vacancies in the employment market through a range of marketing efforts.  As a result, vacancies notified to FÁS in 2007 increased by 12%.The enterprise development agencies of my Department, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are working to ensure that we continue to grow the economy and jobs even in the current more challenging environment.  To facilitate this we need to ensure that our competitiveness is sustained into the future.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I thank the Minister of State.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I am shocked by the blasé reply.  Nobody is in charge.  Nobody is taking this seriously.  For the first time since 1999 there are more than 200,000 people on the live register.  It is the biggest increase — 31% over a 12-month period — since the live register came into being in 1968.  Conditions in the labour market have taken a decided turn for the worst since January last.  Live register unemployment is up by 35,700.  There is a 20.8% increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers on the register since the end of December last, 25,500 men and 10,100 women.  Redundancies are up by 13,564 since January.  Economists predict that the unemployment rate will rise to 6% or more.We reflect the public view that there is no sense in anyone being in charge.  There is no sense in anybody taking this matter seriously.  The blasé nature of the Minister of State's reply vindicates that viewpoint.  Naively, I stated last March that if the Government did not take action soon the number on the live register would be almost 200,000 by the end of the year and that the Government must end its complacency.  What action will the Government take?  What interventions will the Government make to improve the situation?  Will this be moved to the top of the Government's political agenda?  What attempts are being made to save existing jobs and what efforts is the Department making to attract alternative industry to places that are losing jobs and where jobs are being displaced?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The answer was not blasé.  One must look at the matter in the context of what we have achieved in recent years, particularly in view of the fact that there are more than 2.1 million persons working in the Republic.  Certainly, the forecast is that there will be change, particularly in the construction industry.  FÁS has been very involved in early intervention in assessing skill shortages for people who may be let off, where they can go and where they can be retrained.  FÁS is compiling statistics on a regular basis to ensure that it knows exactly the people who are unemployed and whether there can be job placements and if job placements cannot be found immediately, that there are training and retraining programmes.  FÁS has been forceful in that regard.  I commend FÁS and I want to ensure that it continues such efforts.In the national development plan there is a commitment that the national skills strategy is a fundamental plank in ensuring that we remain competitive and that we have a highly mobile, flexible, educated workforce.  We will continue to fund this and ensure that in the national development plan it is given priority.  Those are the two areas, early intervention from FÁS and the national skills strategy.In the context of what we are trying to do in bringing forward investment, the position is we are remaining competitive.  We have a low corporation tax.  IDA Ireland is actively promoting Ireland as a place to do business and we continually market this country as having a highly educated, mobile workforce and a strong economy.All the indicators show that, while there are challenges ahead, the fundamentals of the economy are sound compared with those of the previous generation that faced problems in the 1980s.  The Government is committed in ensuring that we run a solid economy.  The Government is very much in charge.  That is evident in the context of what we are doing in the national development plan.

It is a Government in denial.  The budget figures show a projected 5.5% standardised unemployment rate — the ESRI and FÁS state 6% or more while Bloxhams states 6%.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	498	Essentially, any time we discuss employment in this House we get this lecture about how many jobs have been created in the past ten years.  One could get the same lecture from Fine Gael and Labour, that when we were in government last 1,000 jobs were being created a week.  I am not interested in any lectures about the past, I am interested in the future and what is happening today.  Unemployment is going up and the Government is in denial about it.This is a simple question.  Does the Minister of State stand over the Government's projection of 5.5% unemployment at the end of this year or does he accept the reality, what everyone is saying, that unemployment will rise to 6% this year and higher next year, and that unemployment is effectively the human cost of economic mismanagement by the Government?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	499	It is always important to remind people what we have achieved, especially the Opposition which might sometimes be in denial in that regard.  We are concerned about the situation in which we find ourselves.  There is an international credit crisis which is causing pressures in housing and elsewhere.  That reflects on the construction industry.There have been increases in fuel and commodity prices.  There are considerable international challenges but the fundamentals are sound and the Government is promoting Ireland as a place to do business.  Ireland is still very competitive and the IDA continually markets it.  There are some good news stories in the pipeline.  The IDA is confident it can still market Ireland as a positive place in which to do business.Obviously, redundancies and jobs losses are very regrettable for the individuals concerned.  That is why FÁS is very much involved in early intervention, in assessing skills requirements and job placements and in training people for available job placements.A recent survey shows that 7% of companies have job vacancies.  There are difficulties in certain sectors of the economy.  That was acknowledged in last year's budget when it was pointed out quite clearly that the construction industry was going through change and a readjustment.  That change has been very sharp and is the reason FÁS is concentrating on retraining construction workers.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	500	Is it true the FÁS report stated that 65,000 construction jobs will go by the end of 2009?  Is it that serious?  Will the Minister of State lift the 2004 cap on participation in community employment schemes to allow increased numbers to participate, especially in rural areas?Given the impact on the construction industry, will the Minister of State raise at Government level the idea of borrowing for capital purposes to stimulate the construction industry, especially to help generate activity in the schools building programme so that badly needed schools can be built for children?  It would maintain a level of construction.  Would that not be productive?  It would be borrowing for capital rather than current purposes.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I thank the Deputy.  The Government values any progressive ideas.  When the Minister for Finance is framing his budget, he will take into account the economic realities facing us.  I refer to the projections in regard to unemployment.  Everybody knows the world economy is going through a state of flux.  The weak dollar and sterling are causing our exporters grave difficulties.  We will consider any proposal.  The Minister for Finance will formulate his budget and will come forward with very positive proposals to ensure we remain competitive and to stimulate the economy.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	502	We are hearing about the international situation again.  This is one of the excuses which is always trotted out.  Of course, we are in a more difficult international environment economically but unemployment in Ireland is rising much faster than in other countries.  I believe we are only one of three of the EU 15 in which unemployment is rising.  Does the Minister of State acknowledge that and that unemployment in Ireland is now higher than it is in the Netherlands, Denmark, Britain, Australia and America?  The Minister of State should not hide behind Italy or France.  He should at least acknowledge that the situation in Ireland is worse than it is in many of our key competitors.  Singapore and Israel are the other examples.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	505	We are in the euro zone and we know there are challenges.  The Government is committed to ensuring that we remain competitive, that we have key policies in place, that we fund the national skills strategy and that the IDA actively markets the country.  It is important we state that there are international challenges and that this is not because of failed policies.This is an open exporting economy dependent on exporting to the global market.  That is causing grave difficulty not only for Ireland but for our European competitors as well.  I travelled to India and elsewhere but people are still looking to Ireland as a place to do business.  We should not undermine the fact that this is still a competitive nation with a highly skilled workforce and that Government policies in place will ensure that continues to be the case.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	506	A comprehensive review of the role, functions and remit of the county enterprise boards in the development of micro-enterprises was conducted in 2004, that is, the Fitzpatricks review.  The review largely endorsed the activities and operations of the CEBs and concluded that there is justification for continued State support to micro-enterprises and that the CEB network can continue to play a useful role in the overall national enterprise development policy.  It also recommended that, in providing assistance to micro-enterprises, CEBs should focus more on economic, rather than social or local development, objectives; there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission; the issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed; and there should be a move away from direct grant aid to repayable finance as well as a greater provision of soft supports as an alternative to grant aid.Both the enterprise strategy group report and the recent report of the Small Business Forum endorsed the key recommendations of the Fitzpatricks report on the primary micro-enterprise focus of CEB support and the range of services the boards offer.  While it is acknowledged that there will be differences in requirements and emphasis in the areas served by the various CEBs, I remain satisfied that the current core micro-enterprise remit of the CEBs should remain their primary target market and that the services currently offered by the CEBs, in terms of both financial and non-financial assistance, to that sector represent the most appropriate mix of services.In the context of its key policy role my Department in association with the CEB central co-ordination unit within Enterprise Ireland and with the CEBs, monitors the range of support services offered by the CEBs on an ongoing basis particularly in the light of the economic climate.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I am also very happy with the enterprise boards which do an excellent job.  I served on one for years.  However, it is time we expanded their role in order that they can help more people and companies, both start-up and existing ones.Having served on a board and spoken to people on other boards, I know they are quite limited in terms of who they can help.  I agree there is some discretion but we should give them more scope to try to help more companies.  Some companies have let go two or three staff members over the past couple months.  That has happened quietly and has not hit the headlines.  We have a duty to get the enterprise boards to help them, whether in trying to sustain some of those jobs, in trying to expand their services or in giving them more capital to create more jobs.We probably all agree that small and medium sized enterprises will keep this country going over the next couple of years.  We could use the enterprise boards to channel more grants into existing and new businesses.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on giving them more scope to help more companies, not only manufacturing ones, and to provide not only employment grants.  I know there are partnership bodies but the enterprise boards are best positioned to help maintain and create new jobs because they know how the councils and Government works.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I am particularly familiar with the county enterprise boards and the impact they have on local economies.  The range of services they provide, including mentoring, education and training, and their co-operation with the chambers of commerce and so on should be encouraged.  As I said, in the context of the current economic climate, we will look at submissions coming in from county enterprise boards in regard to the range of services and finance they offer.  Their link to Enterprise Ireland strengthens their position as a player in the economy.Within the county enterprise board structure, we are looking at the high potential start-ups which will give us the core number of companies required to improve our export targets.  The county enterprise boards and the small and medium sized businesses generally are now centre stage.  This is the focus of the work in the Department.  The Minister, when allocating functions to the Ministers of State, asked me to specifically look at county enterprise boards.  Drawing from my knowledge of the boards and my background in business I intend to encourage them to work more and more to maintain and sustain jobs and to link to Enterprise Ireland, which is doing a significant job abroad.  On a recent trade mission to Mexico and Brazil, Irish companies notched up contracts worth in the region of €15 million, which is significant in the context of sustaining jobs at home.  Enterprise Ireland will continue this work and create the focus and potential for the small business sector which relies on county enterprise boards and their direction.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I accept we are on the same wavelength on this matter.  There are at least a couple of IDA enterprise centres in every county, but many are left empty.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for both organisations, albeit under different Ministers of State.  Could there be a deal done whereby enterprise boards might make better use of unused IDA land or buildings?  Perhaps the Minister of State will bear this in mind in his review, as it may be a worthwhile consideration.  The enterprise boards have made good use of their land and buildings.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	510	The former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin, replied to this question some months ago.

#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	512	He said the number of IDA-owned premises is reducing in comparison with recent years.  There is always scope for the local authority and county enterprise board, with the local chamber of commerce, to propose plans and initiatives for vacant buildings or sites.  It is important that local authorities zone the appropriate amount of land to ensure it is available for businesses.  Recently in County Carlow, Merck Sharp & Dohme was attracted to a location because it had 23 acres of land and buildings available and the backing of a nearby third level facility.  These facilities brought in that business.  We need to examine the possible options available to enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland and IDA to ensure we can continue economic growth and job replacement to meet the challenge of outside factors.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I express my disappointment at the decision of the company to close its Cork operations and I have asked the State development agencies under the aegis of my Department to make every effort to assist the workers being made redundant in securing alternative employment.Freescale is a large global company that regularly makes adjustments to resources as a normal course of operations to meet changing business requirements in a very dynamic industry.  The company has decided to streamline its cellular design centres and as part of this decision is proposing that all programmes in its Cork design facility be transferred to other locations and the facility be closed.  The closure of the facility is expected in September 2008 and will result in 47 employees losing their jobs.IDA Ireland is providing ongoing assistance to local management in Freescale, Cork, and is using its network of overseas offices to find alternative employment in the radio frequency and wireless technology area for affected employees in the company.  FÁS has been in contact with the management of Freescale and will make arrangements to register the employees.  The full range of FÁS services will be made available to the employees, as will the services and supports of Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise board for any worker who is considering establishing her or his own business.A variety of differing and complex factors, not just cost related, might influence a decision to relocate all or part of a firm's functions.  In addition to costs, factors might include business takeovers, consolidations and changes in product or market focus.  The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.  Ireland successfully manages this process through our policies on growing indigenous enterprise and attracting and embedding foreign direct investment.  These policies have enabled us to win many prestigious and value added investments and have enabled us to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value in the economy.The pipeline of new business for which the IDA is competing is as strong as at any time in recent years.  We measure success now in terms of the number, quality and spread of investments, not just in job numbers alone.  Ireland is now a global competitor for research and innovation investment from multinational companies and leading research institutions.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.We are progressing on several fronts to meet the targets of the strategy for science, technology and innovation and the development of a knowledge economy.  I believe we will continue to achieve and sustain our excellence in research from which our economy will reap rewards.  The key to our success will be derived from seeing the outputs of current research in terms of new innovations and discoveries that will directly impact on peoples lives.  That is to say these outputs will lead to jobs, improvements in healthcare and new products and services.We continue to have an educated and skilled workforce which will be the cornerstone of the next phase of our economic development.  We are investing in infrastructure, people, innovation and enterprise.  We are confidently investing for our future.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies will continue to support enterprise development and job creation.  I reaffirm that the State agencies will continue to work closely with each other and with local interests to assist in delivering an integrated approach to investment and enterprise development, not just in County Cork but throughout the State.

Some 10% of employees had post-graduate qualifications while 50% of those in the technology centre had attained a fourth-level standard of education.  In the Taoiseach's acceptance speech recently he spoke of the value of science, technology and innovation and suggested these are the types of jobs we seek to create.  I am concerned about these developments and I wish to hear the Minister's reaction to these job losses, as they are high-end in nature and the type of jobs on which we are basing the future of the economy.  The Minister of State mentioned cost factors in his reply.  Perhaps he could expand on the cost factors influencing this decision.

County Cork has benefited from an increase in overall jobs from 13,000 in 1998 to more than 20,000 last year.  These are largely in the bio-pharmaceutical and ICT sectors.  The Deputy is correct in that the Government is committed to developing jobs at third and fourth level, which we call value-added jobs.  It is committing €300 million this year to both Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to help progress this aim.

However, the Freescale closure sends out the wrong message to students such as those who have just completed the leaving certificate.  The Minister of State encourages such people to study science and technology, yet the type of job that the Government and the IDA seek to attract is gone.  Does this send out a message to potential students of science?

#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	523	The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was established in 2007 on an interim basis on foot of a commitment in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.  NERA has responsibility for the promotion and enforcement of compliance with employment law generally.  Under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 NERA may undertake inspections to check compliance with the provisions of the Act and in certain circumstances may initiate prosecutions for failure to comply with particular provisions.NERA inspection services carry out inspections as a result of complaints received, targeted campaigns and routine inspections.  Where breaches of employment rights legislation are detected, NERA seeks compliance and rectification of breaches identified, including redress for the employees concerned and payment of any underpayment of wages due to those employees.NERA Prosecution Service is empowered to prosecute employers for breaches of employment legislation.  However, in the majority of cases employers rectify breaches of employment law and pay underpayments of wages due to employees without prosecution.  However, NERA reserves the right to initiate prosecutions in respect of breaches of employment legislation.On the matter of secretaries and caretakers in schools, two complaints have been received by NERA inspection services to date in 2008.  The investigation of one of these complaints has been completed and no breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act were found.  The investigation of the second complaint is ongoing.If the Deputy has specific information of secretaries and caretakers in schools that are being paid below the minimum wage, he may make a complaint to the inspection services of NERA, which will investigate the matter.  Details of how to contact NERA and NERA complaint forms are available from the NERA website.  The Deputy should also be aware that rights commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I thank the Minister of State for his reply, which did not inform me about very much, other than the two complaints made this year.  I was aware of the rest of his reply but I thank him for his courtesy.  Is he aware of the widespread abuse of the payment of caretakers and secretaries across the State?  A number of trade unions have run a campaign for more than a year to highlight this issue.  Is the Minister of State aware the issue arises because the Department of Education and Science pays salaries of caretakers and secretaries to the schools involved rather than directly to them?  Will he consider asking the Department to employ them directly, which would ensure widespread breaches of employment law would no longer occur?
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	525	No breaches of employment law have occurred, other than the two I outlined.  There is absolutely no evidence of what the Deputy says.  If he has evidence and forwards it to us, we will refer it directly to NERA for investigation.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Is the Minister of State aware a number of secretaries and caretakers have not complained to NERA out of loyalty to their schools?  That is the main reason for them not making complaints to the agency but they are concerned.  In other cases when the issue was raised with boards of management and the staff threatened to go to NERA, their hours of employment were reduced substantially but they still worked as many hours as they had done previously out of sheer loyalty.  An abuse is taking place and there is a simple way to deal with it.  The Minister of State should make representations to the Department of Education and Science to employ the secretaries and caretakers directly.  Will he consider doing that?
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	527	This is a matter between the Department of Education and Science and IMPACT and discussions are ongoing.  I reiterate that if the Deputy is aware of a specific instance, he should refer it to us and we will pass it on to NERA.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Given the significant reduction in construction-related activity and the subsequent increase in the numbers of construction workers who have been made redundant, I am very conscious of the need to try to accommodate apprentices in the completion of their apprenticeships.  To achieve this, both my Department and FÁS have been actively examining this issue and we propose a series of actions to facilitate redundant apprentices in completing their studies.  These include the following: through its employment services division, FÁS will focus on assisting redundant apprentices to source employment in order that they can complete their apprenticeship by receiving the appropriate on-the-job training and undertake the associated competence-based assessments; and FÁS will also allow apprentices who are made redundant to progress to their next off-the-job training phase of their apprenticeship, without having to do the next on-the-job phase first.  A regional register of redundant apprentices is being established by FÁS.  Employers who are considering recruiting apprentices will be requested to consider the employment of redundant apprentices listed on the register.  The Construction Industry Federation and FÁS are meeting to resolve a number of issues in the construction sector, including redundant apprentices.  FÁS will explore with the relevant authorities the accreditation of the on-the-job work experience and competency-based assessments where the apprentice has obtained employment abroad.  My Department and FÁS will continue to monitor trends and activities in the industry and will work with all of the relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and satisfactory responses to assist redundant apprentices to complete their apprenticeships.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The question was tabled prior to the enterprise committee meeting last week.  I welcome the Minister's comments at the meeting.  This is an important issue because between 40,000 and 50,000 construction jobs will be lost.  I do not know how many will be lost by apprentices but it will probably be several thousand.  It is important they should be facilitated and assisted in any way possible to complete their qualification with which they can travel or build on.  Has the Minister of State given consideration to allowing apprentices to do their on-the-job work experience overseas?  Significant construction work will be undertaken in the UK and the more successful economies in Europe in the coming years.  Perhaps a mechanism could be found to allow apprentices to travel to London to assist with the construction work on the Underground system for the Olympic Games and to have that accredited to their apprenticeship.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Redundancies have occurred and approximately 950 apprentices have presented themselves to FÁS in recent months.  FÁS is very conscious of this issue and we want to retain the skills net.  There is not much point investing a great deal of time, effort and money in training people to trade level and have them fail in the final few months prior to obtaining their accreditation.  FÁS is putting measures in place and the CIF is also working closely with the body.  I accept and acknowledge many trades people are non-nationals and they may move elsewhere.  We do not want a scenario in a few years when the economy evolves and construction picks up in other areas under the national development plan with funding for capital projects where there is a scarcity of young trained trades people.Accreditation is an issue.  If apprentices can travel abroad, there must be a recognised accreditation board in the country concerned.  Those who travel to countries with a recognised accreditation system, acceptable to Ireland, should be encouraged.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I also raised this issue at last week's committee meeting.  I advocate the opening of the apprenticeship route again for plasterers, plumbers, carpenters, electricians and so on.  I brought to the attention of the director general of FÁS, Rody Molloy, an issue affecting young electrical apprentices.  Many have acquired tremendous practical skills and they are excellent.  They then participate in their block release programme in the institute of technology but about six or eight months before they qualify, they go down in an academic subject.   After two or three strikes, they are out.  Many famous students spent a long time in university.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	532	On the ring road.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	533	When I corresponded with Mr. Molloy, I asked him to examine this immediately.  Very often a young person can get nervous and the academic aspect of their training becomes an obstacle, which prevents them from qualifying, even though they are experts and geniuses on the job.  Could this be re-examined to give them another opportunity to ensure they qualify because they will be needed to implement the national development plan?
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I get nervous when I have to answer the Deputy's questions.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	535	Unfortunately, the Minister of State is not showing it.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The issue has been raised in correspondence by a number of Deputies and I will follow up on it.  As the Deputy said, these people are fully trained and they have an entire set of skills but they fall foul in the academic area.  The director general of FÁS is examining this issue.  I will contact him to let him know the Deputy raised this in the House.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	537	In the year to May 2008, the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages, as measured by consumer price index data compiled by the CSO, increased by 7.8%.  The main cause of this increase in food prices has been the global rise in commodity and energy prices.  Food prices have increased sharply in virtually all parts of the world and this has affected some developing countries particularly badly.  Though I want to make it clear that I am not making any specific forecasts about future trends, there is evidence food price inflation has begun to moderate.  The cumulative increase of 1.4% in food prices in the three months to May 2008, for example, was half the increase of 2.8% in the three months to April 2008.  The consumer price index data for May 2008 also showed reductions over the preceding month in the price of a number of food items such as eggs, breakfast cereals, cheese and biscuits.  The European Commission has stated recent falls in food commodity prices should generally continue, and markets stabilise, in the months ahead.We cannot insulate consumers from the effects of global increases in commodity and energy prices and it would be misleading to pretend otherwise.  We can take steps to ensure we have effective competition at the main points of the food supply chain domestically and that we have informed and empowered consumers willing to use their purchasing power to put pressure on retailers to compete properly on price with their rivals.  The Government has asked the Competition Authority to monitor the operation of the grocery trade on an ongoing basis in respect of matters such as the competitive structure of the wholesale and retail sectors and the analysis of price trends.  I have also recently requested the National Consumer Agency to undertake broader and more frequent price surveys.  Where direct engagement with retailers is justified in the consumer's interest, I will not hesitate to act, as I have done recently, in response to public and Government concern about the apparent reluctance of the retail sector to pass on to consumers the benefits of the euro's appreciation against sterling.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	538	The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment met recently with the National Consumer Agency to discuss the high cost of foodstuffs in Ireland.  In addition, many media reports state that basic foodstuffs are more expensive in Ireland than anywhere else.The National Consumer Agency carries out numerous surveys and undertakes a great deal of research in regard to food prices.  For the purpose of one particular survey, it purchased the same basket of items in each of the better known supermarkets and found there was only a 35 cent difference between them.  This smacks of collusion or suggests competition is forcing the supermarkets to lower their prices.  Is the Minister aware there is very little difference between the cost of a basket of goods purchased in either Tesco, Dunnes Stores, SuperValu and so on?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	539	I am aware of it.  A number of issues arise, including that of price tracking.  The Competition Authority has been requested to examine a number of issues.  It has already produced two reports on competitiveness and is currently preparing another one.  There is no indication of anti-competitive practices within the market.It is important to state — this issue was discussed in committee — that often it is the market that determines the price.  We anticipate that the market will reflect any swings or changes in consumer attitude and power.  We are currently trying to ensure this is what happens.  I accept it is happening at present to a small extent.In my previous capacity as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, an issue of grave concern was the primary consumer who had not had an increase in income capacity for a considerable period, yet the consumer was discontent with prices in this area.  There are differentials involved.  If one reads the front page of The Farmers’ Journal, one will note there has been a reduction in the price of dairy products.  The fact that trading and commodities has increased considerably in the world market is outside our capacity.  This is putting a great deal of financial pressure on people.It is important, if we are to change the market and provide real value for money for the consumer, that we empower the consumer to allow this to happen.  I am determined — I know we are all ad idem on this — to ensure people obtain transferability from the sterling-euro differential.

Will she consider amending the Companies Act?  If not, will she at least wave the stick at retailers that if prices do not come down the Companies Act will be amended to require them to publish their Irish profits, which is not currently the case?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	541	I do not have any evidence of anti-competitive practices within the retail sector.

There are no indications of anti-competitive practices in the retail sector.  The Competition Authority has examined the matter and has stated there is no evidence of anti-competitive practices in the sector.  That is not to suggest people are not disgruntled and unhappy in regard to prices in the overall retail sector.  It is on this basis the matter will be pursued as vigorously as possible.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I wish to make two points in respect of the Minister's response.

We seem to follow one another around.  There is a significant difference between the farmgate price and that which the consumer is charged.  I am speaking now about Irish goods.  Who is the beneficiary of that differential?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I can say, from my experience in agriculture, that this impasse has existed for a considerable time.  The consumer liaison group within my Department investigated the matter.  The Deputy will know no finite conclusion was reached in this regard.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Another miracle.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I do not do miracles.  Issues such as costs for retailers are being examined.  This will factor in some of the issues raised by Members of the House on a number of occasions.  It is difficult to ascertain and determine what is a fair price for the primary producer and what provides value for money for the consumer.  We must factor in the sustainability of the retail sector which is very important to the economy.  We want to ensure we have a vibrant retail sector.  All of these factors must be taken into consideration.  It would be great if there was one answer to fit all.  It is important to point out we are trying to address this issue.I do my utmost as, I am sure, do most Members, to buy locally produced Irish goods and to encourage people in the food and beverage sector to do likewise as doing so provides added value from a true regional policy perspective.  In regard to the production of branded and non-branded goods, various issues arise.  I do not have a resolution to this problem.  However, it is my fervent view that we will continue to push this issue.  I know my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, will do likewise.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 27 together.I consider that the appropriate mechanism for the consumer perspective to be channelled into the partnership process is via the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the support of the National Consumer Agency, NCA.Towards 2016 recognises the importance of competition and providing a fair deal for consumers.  In this regard, the NCA has a strong mandate in terms of consumer advocacy, research, information, enforcement and is resourced to promote the consumers' case.My Department is represented directly in the partnership process.  I am satisfied that it is well placed, with the support of the NCA, to bring a consumer perspective to that process.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Many people sit around the table in the partnership process.  I believe the National Consumer Agency has a particular role to play in this regard.  We spoke earlier about the price of foodstuffs.  Other issues of concern are energy costs, financial products and communications facilities, be they mobile phones or broadband.  In the interests of the consumer, the NCA would be well placed to sit at that table.  I ask that the Minister of State reconsider the matter.The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is represented in the process as are unions and employers.

#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The broad spectrum of society is represented at partnership talks.  Regarding the NCA, that comes through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which is directly represented at the table in the context of partnership discussions.  IBEC, trade unions and the voluntary and community sector advocate lower prices for consumers in their various guises in the social and community pillar.  Everybody at the table is interested in making sure that we have a competitive retail market that ensures the consumer is protected.  That is something we always monitor.  Our Department is the lead one in making sure that consumers' rights are protected.  The Tánaiste has already indicated the measures she has taken towards contacting retailers.  It is a matter of sitting down and discussing with RGDATA and others the fact that price differentials between the Republic and Northern Ireland, for example, have not been passed on as we would have liked.  Politicians take an active role in this, not only in the views they express in this Chamber, but also when they sit down to partnership talks.It is important to acknowledge after last week's Lisbon treaty referendum that the European Commissioner for Competition, Ms Neelie Kroes, is initiating an investigation about the sterling price differential not being passed on here.  That was referred to earlier today.  Many people are very conscious and concerned about making sure that the consumer is protected and most importantly our Department takes a lead role in this at partnership talks.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	558	We have often referred to the important role that small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses contribute to employment in this country.  They are the backbone, particularly in the current economic climate.  I understand ISME has made a submission or request to be considered as part of the partnership talks.  Its members, who have a lot to contribute, represent thousands of small businesses across the country.  Is it not important to have ISME at the table?  This is particularly so because of the view they have expounded on many occasions concerning levels of bureaucracy and red tape that prohibit many businesses getting off the ground.  Many already in existence are strangled by this.  ISME could contribute from that perspective and its contribution would be expansive and useful because of that experience.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	559	Obviously, any organisation can make representations and submissions to partnership.  There is a broad spectrum of representatives around the table already.  Anything that contributes to a positive outcome and decisions by social partnership is welcome.  Regarding ISME, this Department is very conscious of its role in ensuring the removal of regulatory burdens.  We have a commitment to reduce that by 25% so when any proposals come forward, they are proofed and analysed to ensure that we do not put further burdens on small businesses.

Business gets its bit, at any rate big business does, the unions get theirs, farmers get something and Government politicians and Ministers who are supposed to stand up for taxpayers and consumers do not do so.  In the current context, given the politicians we have, does the Minister agree that the best way for consumers to be protected is to ensure that there is a consumer advocate, the NCA or another one, and a taxpayer advocate who would be a central part of the partnership process?   If consumers and taxpayers are not satisfied, the partnership will not proceed.Reference was made to the voluntary community pillar.  The Minister will be aware that the Consumers Association of Ireland applied for inclusion in that grouping and was refused by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Will she ask the Taoiseach to reconsider that decision and to include the association as a partner in the community and voluntary pillar?

He seems to forget that the fundamentals of partnership are about consensus and decisions.  The Government is the lead player in social partnership talks.  There is a broad spectrum of representation, from business, trade unions and farmers to the social and voluntary pillar, which collectively come to an agreement and decide, not only about pay but about other policies such as taxation, funding of our services, training and education and so on.  That has served this country very well.

#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Unemployment is measured by the quarterly national household survey, collated and published by the CSO.  The latest release on 5 June for the first quarter, December-February 2008, shows that there are now 28,800 young people unemployed, an increase of 1,000 in the year, and the youth unemployment rate is 8.8%.  This is one of the lowest among other EU member states and compares favourably to the youth unemployment rate for the EU 27 in 2007 of 15.4%.The latest live register release on 10 June, relating to the month of May, recorded 42,730 young people under 25 as signing on, an increase of 12,169 in the year.  The live register is not designed to measure unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers who might be signing on from time to time.A range of measures and supports is provided on an ongoing basis by FÁS, aimed specifically at assisting young people who have greater difficulty in entering or re-entering the labour market.  These include an extensive range of training interventions for young early school leavers as part of the Youthreach programme jointly managed by FÁS and the Department of Education and Science.  The interventions are delivered in predominantly disadvantaged areas in both urban and rural communities, through the provision of training, education and learning supports to enhance opportunities for progression to the labour market or further training and education.A range of bridging, specific skills training courses and traineeship programmes, accredited by FETAC, is provided through FÁS training centres.  These programmes help to raise participants to raise their educational and skill levels and to gain work experience with a view to improving individual employability.  Job clubs funded by FÁS, in conjunction with the community and voluntary sectors, are aimed at providing enhanced job-seeking supports, such as interview skills, CV preparation etc.While the slowdown in the economy has resulted in less employment growth than that experienced more recently, employment has grown by 2.6% or 53,800 in the year to the first quarter of 2008 and is forecast to continue to grow this year by 24,000.  In addition, the employment market still has job vacancies.  The most recent FÁS-ESRI employment and vacancies survey for April 2008 shows that 7% of firms are reporting vacancies.For anyone who may become unemployed a number of supports are available.  After three months on the live register those who are still unemployed are referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS to assist them into training or employment.  FÁS is working through its own employment service and with the local employment service provided by area based partnerships to provide increased interviewing and caseload management capacity to respond to the increased numbers on the live register.Specifically, FÁS is implementing a range of short and medium-term actions for those affected by the increase in unemployment and the construction slowdown.  These include putting in place training to upskill construction workers in respect of emerging needs; business training and mentoring for workers from larger enterprises entering self-employment; developing measures to ensure continuity in the apprenticeship system; and promoting access for mobile workers to construction jobs elsewhere in the EU, including the UK.

First, of those who lost their jobs in the past year almost 50% are under 35 and, second, between two thirds and three quarters of those who became unemployed during that period are male.  That probably reflects the downturn in the construction sector but it is terrifying.  Has any action been taken to identify the several hundred thousand people in sunset industries whose jobs are at risk due to economic recession?  What has been done to provide them with skills to ensure they will be able to find new employment, without having to wait three months, when they lose their jobs?  Thus, they will not end up in the dole queues at all.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The first task is to analyse the job losses and quantify the numbers and the second is to determine whether the State is responding by way of putting in place a wide range of support mechanisms to create new jobs or teach the skills required by those who need to upskill to get new jobs.  The Deputy's question referred to what the Government is doing to assist young people.  There is a range of access programmes for young people to allow them get on to the employment ladder.There is funding available through Skillnets and other programmes for those who have been identified as at risk to be reskilled, even before they leave employment.  These programmes have proven quite successful and are widely supported by the chambers of commerce throughout the country.The understanding of the county enterprise boards regarding what might happen to local economies is another matter.  We need to establish a view on all the programmes that are operating locally to determine their exact impact and weaknesses.  The economic climate is changing and we need to respond.  It is not as if the programmes are not in place because they are, but they may have to be fine-tuned.  We may have to introduce more.  The Government understands the position of those who lose their jobs and it and its agencies will do everything possible to ensure employees are sufficiently skilled to take up whatever jobs might be available.The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, referred to the construction industry and those who need to be reskilled by FÁS or introduced to new possibilities within other countries in terms of how they might take up employment or exploit the potential to make money in terms of other developing economies.  Work is being done on every aspect of this matter.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	579	Sections 48 and 49 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 sought to restrict the manner in which some traders impose additional charges on consumers solely by reason of the method of payment chosen by the consumer when paying for goods and services.In the course of public consultation carried out by my predecessor as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin, on the possible impact of these provisions, a number of issues requiring legal advice were raised.  These issues related in the main to the compatibility of sections 48 and 49 with the provisions of EU law and in particular with the provisions of the European directive on unfair commercial practices.  The Attorney General's strong advice was that sections 48 and 49 were not compatible with the directive, particularly with the maximum harmonisation nature of that directive.  Accordingly, my colleague decided not to introduce the said provisions.The payment services directive, which is due to be transposed into Irish law by 1 November 2009, is essentially the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The Attorney General has advised, however, that sections 48 and 49, as currently drafted, may not be compatible with the provisions of the directive and that any legislation that would seek to restrict payment method charges would have to be considered in the context of the specific discretions given to member states in the directive to introduce laws in this area.  In this regard, I understand that the Department of Finance held public consultation on the domestic transposition of the directive, which concluded on 16 May 2008.  The results of that consultation are currently being studied with a view to preparing a draft legal text.  I am advised by the Department of Finance that no final decisions have yet been taken with regard to any of the national discretions permitted by the directive.Notwithstanding the legal advice in relation to sections 48 and 49, I remain concerned about the manner in which some traders impose payment method surcharges upon customers, particularly vulnerable customers.  In this regard, my Department is currently examining the possibility of making regulations under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 with a view to obliging those traders who do impose payment method charges to include information on those charges in any advertisements for their goods and services.  I hope, therefore, it will be possible to introduce regulations in this area to ensure that where payment method charges are imposed, consumers are fully aware of them before making a transactional decision to purchase goods or services.

It is clear the directive will empower the Government to ban credit and debit card surcharges.  Will the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment confirm this with the Minister for Finance?  Will she make a commitment to introducing the necessary legislation to amend the Consumer Protection Act to allow the ban to be introduced once the directive comes into force in November 2009?

Higgins — the decision to cease funding to language and integration teaching being delivered by Integrate Ireland Language and Training; (10) Deputy Ciarán Cuffe — the need to discuss the current political situation in Zimbabwe, specifically the lead-in to the Zimbabwean presidential run-off elections and the action the Irish Government has taken following the all-party motion passed by Dáil Éireann on 15 May 2008; and (11) Deputy Joanna Tuffy — the need for the Minister to provide an update on the need to ensure that the indigenous Irish lighting industry is included at all stages of consultation with industry on the proposed banning, or phasing out, of traditional light bulbs and that Irish jobs are protected when implementing the proposed changes.The matters raised by Deputies Joe McHugh, Terence Flanagan, Michael D. Higgins and Liz McManus have been selected for discussion.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House.  As usual, he will have a standard response.It is important to outline the seriousness of the withdrawal of special educational needs services in County Donegal.  I am trying, with great difficulty, to get to the bottom of it.  A major barrier is that neither the Department of Education and Science nor the Department of Health and Children is willing to take responsibility.  The Opposition has spoken at length about its objection to quangos.  The National Council for Special Education is a quango and is not taking responsibility for the withdrawal of services for children with special educational needs.The children to whom I refer, whose needs might arise from having asthma, ADHD, Down's syndrome, spina bifida, Asperger's syndrome or autism, require the services in question.  They are the most vulnerable people in society, but they are being ignored and neglected.  Let me give an example.  Carndonagh secondary school, formerly the largest secondary school in the country, had six special needs assistants last year but that number is to be reduced to three this year.  The children who need the assistants are still at school and, moreover, three extra children are now enrolled there.Over 300 parents and teachers and other concerned individuals met publicly in Ballyliffin in north Inishowen last Monday night to articulate the serious need for services for the children with special educational needs.  The services were put in place last year but are to be withdrawn in September.  I am talking parochially but the quango that is the NCSE, the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children need to state why the children are being discriminated against and why parents are being left in limbo regarding whether their children will be able go to school in September.Yesterday, a parent drove from Letterkenny to Dublin.  I told her I would meet her tonight or that I would meet her in Letterkenny on Friday.  However, she replied that her ten year old daughter, who has spina bifida and is in a wheelchair, has had her hours slashed and the situation was so serious that she will not be sending her child to school in September.  It is ironic that the Minister of State with responsibility for integration is present.  While that is a completely different portfolio, this pertains to the integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream classrooms.  However, funding is being slashed and special needs assistants are being withdrawn from such schools.I have great difficulty in getting to the bottom of this issue and together with parents in my constituency, I need to know the reason such services are being withdrawn.  More specifically, why is no one answerable or accountable for such decisions?  I raised this matter this evening to ascertain the terms of reference of the special education needs organiser and the identity of whoever drew them up.  Moreover, where do accountability and responsibility lie?  I would welcome a deviation on the part of the Minister of State from his prepared departmental script and would appreciate it, were he in a position to indicate to the House a way forward for the most vulnerable.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I am pleased to have been given the opportunity by the Deputy to clarify the position regarding the matters raised by him.  The National Council for Special Education was set up to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children.The Deputy may find it helpful if I outline the background to the establishment of the council.  It was clear that the Department did not have the capacity to deliver the required level of service to schools, parents and pupils under its existing structures.  In October 1999, a high level planning group was established to review current procedures and to make recommendations on the arrangements that should be put in place to ensure the effective provision of a high-quality co-ordinated education service for students with disabilities.  The planning group highlighted the over-centralised structure of the Department and its lack of any locally based capacity for service delivery and co-ordination as key deficiencies in the system.  The planning group recommended the establishment of a National Council for Special Education to address these deficiencies.The National Council for Special Education was established as an independent statutory body by order of the Minister for Education and Science in December 2003.  With effect from 1 October 2005, it has been formally established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, the EPSEN Act.  That Act sets out both the general functions of the council and its specific function in respect of the provisions of the Act.  The EPSEN Act 2004 provides a framework for delivery of special education services, as well as statutorily underpinning the work of the National Council for Special Education.The general functions of the council as set out in section 20 of the EPSEN Act may be summarised as follows: Planning and co-ordinating provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs; disseminating information on best practice concerning the education of children with special educational needs; providing information to parents regarding the entitlements of children with special educational needs; assessing and reviewing resources required by children with special educational needs; ensuring that progress of students with special educational needs is monitored and reviewed; and advising the Department on matters relating to special education.  In addition, the council has specific functions regarding the core provisions of the Act, such as assessment and individual education plans.The council's staff includes a chief executive officer and administrative staff who are based in Trim, County Meath.  Special educational needs organisers, SENOs, of whom there are approximately 80, are deployed on a nationwide basis with at least one SENO being deployed in each county.  The SENOs process applications from schools for additional teaching and special needs assistant support for children with special educational needs and issue decisions to schools directly.  The council took over this function from the Department in January 2005 and operates within the Department's criteria in allocating such support. These criteria have been articulated in various Department circulars and copies have been circulated to schools.In considering applications for teaching and special needs assistant supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the needs identified in the child's professional report and decide whether the circumstances come within the Department's criteria.  They then consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupil from its current level of resources.  A child in a mainstream primary school may, for example, be entitled to additional resource teaching provision in school under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports, whereby such schools have been provided with a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.  A child with more significant needs may be entitled to an allocation of additional resource hours if the child's assessment places the child within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by the Department's circular.In the context of special needs assistant support, a child needing occasional assistance with toileting may, for example, only require a limited amount of a special needs assistant's time, which may be available within the school.  As the Deputy may be aware, special needs assistant support in schools is intended to address the care needs of pupils with special educational needs.  The criteria for the provision of special needs assistant support envisage that such support is sanctioned when a child has a significant medical need, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or when the child is a danger to him or herself or other pupils.  It is to be expected that very often, this level of care should diminish as the child matures and consequently, the level of special needs assistant support required in the school also will diminish.  When a child with special educational needs is in receipt of additional supports in a school and moves school or moves to post-primary education, and no other child with special needs enrols in the school, then the resource, such as resource teaching hours or special needs assistant support or both, is withdrawn from the first school and, if still warranted by the child's needs, is sanctioned for the new school.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents also may contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  The Deputy will be aware that the education of children with special educational needs is a key policy priority for the Government.  Much has already been achieved in this area in respect of delivering additional teaching and care supports.  There have been significant developments in special education since 1998 involving enhanced levels of provision, as well as new structural and legislative frameworks for the delivery of services to pupils with special educational needs.  At present, there are more than 19,000 staff in schools working solely with children with special needs.  This includes almost 10,000 special needs assistants, compared with only 300 in 1997.  There also are more than 7,800 resource and learning support teachers, compared with approximately 2,000 in 1998.  More than 1,100 other teachers support children in our special schools, while hundreds more work in special classes.These additional supports are allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs.  It also must be acknowledged that, during the necessary period of preparation and planning for the roll-out of the EPSEN Act 2004, my Department continues to expand capacity and services for students with special educational needs.I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position on this matter.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue this evening, which relates to two schools in my constituency of Dublin North-East.  I call on the Minister for Education and Science to revisit urgently the decision to cut back one teacher each from St. Kevin's junior national school, Donaghmede and SS. Peter and Paul's boys' national school, Baldoyle.  I have been informed by the principals of both schools that the number of pupils in each will increase from next September.  How does the Minister expect the schools to cope with an increase in pupil numbers when simultaneously, staff numbers are to be reduced?  The current crisis in the education system is an issue of national importance and I urge the Minister to reconsider these unnecessary cutbacks in teacher numbers.Last month, the Fine Gael Party tabled a Private Members' motion to prevent 28 primary schools from losing teachers.  I highlighted the plight of St. Kevin's junior national school, Donaghmede, and SS. Peter and Paul's boys' national school, Baldoyle, during the debate and appealed to the Minister for Education and Science to reconsider the preposterous decision to reduce staffing numbers in the aforementioned national schools.  Unfortunately, the Minister ignored my plea and I beseech him once again to reinstate these teachers.The Government has reneged on its promises to cut classroom sizes.  In the programme for Government in 2002, it was stated that over the next five years maximum class guidelines would be introduced to ensure that the average class size for children under nine would be below the international best practice guideline of 20 to one.  The Government pledged to reduce class sizes to one teacher for every 26 pupils by September 2008.  However, these promises lie in shreds as the Minister for Education and Science recently instructed 28 primary schools to cut back a teacher.St. Kevin's national school in Donaghmede will lose a teacher in the upcoming school year.  The school will now consist of four classes, which will mean the amalgamation of the existing classes of junior infants into one class of 35.  This class includes six children for whom English is not their first language, one child with special needs and children with mixed abilities.  This is certainly an unworkable solution.  To have 35 students in one room is outrageous, but to have students that are not fulfilling their own educational needs put in with children with special needs is completely unworkable for the teacher.  We should be reducing class sizes rather than increasing them.  The school also has a fully equipped classroom available, but this will remain unused because of the latest round of cutbacks.  All we need is the reinstatement of one teacher.The loss of a teacher in St. Peter and Paul's national school in Baldoyle will leave 29 junior infants in one class.  This teacher would have facilitated an extra junior infants class, something which occurred before.  It would enable the younger children to obtain a proper introduction to school life in a much smaller classroom setting.  How can pupils receive a proper education if they are in a classroom of 29?  In October 2007, the school predicted a slight decrease in pupil enrolment for the following year.  However, this has changed and there will be an increase in students next September.I ask the Minister of State to re-examine the proposed cutback in the school, which is totally unacceptable.  There was a debate earlier today about unemployment.  We must educate our young people if we want to ensure there are no greater increases in unemployment.  The pupil-teacher ratio in Ireland is higher than the norm and the Government has failed the people by breaking promises made in its programme for Government.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State to look again at the proposal to sack 28 school teachers.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the Department's commitment to the provision of teaching resources to primary schools and the position on the schools to which the Deputy referred.The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.  This is a transparent way of ensuring that all schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.  The schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils.  Under a system that allocates additional teachers at different step points under a common schedule, it is a fact of life that changes in enrolment can effect the mainstream staffing of a school.Any year that enrolments fall in a school can result in the loss of a teacher.  Equally, when enrolments increase a school can gain a teacher under the operation of the staffing schedule.  While around 120 schools will lose a teacher in the next school year compared to this year, there will still be a net increase of around 500 teachers, as five times as many schools are expected to employ an additional teacher due to an increase in enrolments.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools, there is provision for additional posts to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year, and these are known as developing school posts.  Under such arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment on 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure.  If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.  It is open to the board of management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board, which was established to adjudicate appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools.  Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule.  The criteria are also available in circular 0024/2007, which is available on the Department's website.The programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position on the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.  While the programme indicated a specific timeline for further changes to the staffing schedule in order to reduce class sizes, it simply was not possible to move any further in the current year.  Even since the presentation of last December's budget, there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment.  In that context, any reasonable observer would regard that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools since last summer as a considerable investment.Data submitted to the Department of Education and Science by the board of management of St. Kevin's junior national school in Donaghmede indicate that the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2006 was 121 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule in circular 0020/2007, which is available on the Department's website, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007-08 school year is a principal and four mainstream class teachers.  According to data submitted by the board of management, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2007 was 113 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule of circular 0010/2008, which is also available on the Department's website and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008-09 school year will be a principal and three mainstream class teachers.The board of management of St. Kevin's junior national school lodged an appeal with the primary staffing appeal board.  The staffing of the school for the 2008-09 school year was considered by the appeal board on 20 May 2008.  The board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in circular 0024/2007, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case.  The board of management of St. Kevin's junior national school was notified in writing of the decision of the appeal board on 26 May 2008.Data submitted to the Department by the board of management of St. Peter and Paul's national school in Baldoyle indicate that the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2006 was 233 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007-08 school year is a principal and nine mainstream class teachers.  According to data submitted by the board of management, the enrolment in the school on 30 September 2007 was 231 pupils.  In accordance with the staffing schedule, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008-09 school year will be a principal and eight mainstream class teachers. The board of management of St. Peter and Paul's national school lodged an appeal with the primary staffing appeal board.  The appeal was heard at the appeal board meeting on 20 May 2008.  The appeal board, having considered the appeal with regard to the criteria outlined in circular 0024/2007, deferred a decision on the appeal application pending receipt of further information.  When this process has been completed, the board of management will be notified of the outcome of the appeal.The Deputy will appreciate that the appeal board operates independently of the Department and the Minister and its decision is final.

Last Thursday, 40 teachers and four support staff were told the language and integration service they had been providing to over 3,000 people who had arrived in Ireland over the last couple of years would be suspended.  As a result the 44 employees have been served with redundancy notices.  The Department of Education and Science did not consult with the staff on this and neither has it provided alternative services.  Instead, in its rather dishonest press release, it suggested:Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd. has informed the Department of its decision to cease providing direct English language tuition to adult refugees and has requested that the Department mainstream this activity within the education system.What in fact happened was that the Department of Education and Science told the board that it was not going to fund IILT any more.  The board had no option but to fold and give its employees redundancy notices.  The press release from the Department continued:The Irish Vocational Education Authority will be asked to identify how direct English language tuition for adult refugees can continue through the VEC network.It is going to ask for proposals.  It has not got an alternative service in place.  It went on to state:The Department is currently exploring other options to provide for in-service training for English language support teachers in primary and post-primary schools.That is not in place either, so the existing system, which looked after 907 people in 2006 alone, and 3,000 over the last four years, employing 44 people — with technical information and a website that was being used and appreciated in about nine centres throughout the country — is closed down, with no notice to staff and without an alternative service being put in place.  The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, had suggested that since the OPW had sold the property in which IILT's headquarters was located, it was to move to a school.  The original headquarters had been at the veterinary college in Ballsbridge which was sold to private developers, as one might expect from the Government.  The then Minister announced in 2007 that IILT would be moving to Greendale comprehensive school.  In February 2008 the staff had been invited to look at the new headquarters.  Then last Thursday they were called in to be told the service was gone, their jobs were no more and they would  get statutory redundancy.  That is integration — close down the service before a replacement is put in place.  The different materials and aids that IILT had been using so successfully are to be transmitted to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and in time they will go somewhere else.I believe the Minister of State knows very well that the service which was being provided was at five levels, and was not only about language.  It was about being in a new country and how to read, as it were, the demands of a new situation.  There was a long history to all of this.  It would have been very interesting, for example, to provide that in the short term the service could be continued while the mainstreamed alternative was being put in place.  However, that is not happening.  There is no sign of the mainstreamed alternative.  There is neither a better nor equal alternative.In all of these circumstances, one should bear in mind that the Irish Refugee Council is in support of what I am saying and in terms of expressing horror at this.  One should remember whom we are talking about.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees's newly arrived placement refugees will receive in the interim no language or integration training as a result of this disastrous and undemocratic decision last Thursday.

Since then IILT has provided direct English language tuition to adult refugees, primarily in the greater Dublin area and increasingly in recent years in a number of outreach centres around the country.  At any one time it had approximately 450 students receiving English language tuition.  IILT in the past also provided some in-service seminars to language support teachers in schools, although the company ceased providing such seminars in mid-2007.  The Department is currently exploring other options to provide in-service for English language support teachers in primary and post-primary schools.IILT approached the Department of Education and Science earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition, except for provision for programme refugees, and requested that the Department mainstream direct tuition within the education system. I assure the Deputy that this was an approach by IILT itself, not a move initiated by the Department.  This is a request the Department is happy to agree to at this time as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in Migration Nation, a statement on integration strategy and diversity management recently launched by me, as Minister of State with responsibility for integration.Following the withdrawal of IILT from direct provision and from in-service seminars, the Department has decided to redirect the funding for these activities to other providers.  The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to co-operate and collaborate with the Department of Education and Science in delivery of necessary English language services.  The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL provision.  The sector is providing English language services for those whose first language is not English.  At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually, which makes a mockery of claims made in some quarters that the VEC system is not capable of carrying out this task.

These materials are currently available on IILT's website and I assure the Deputy that they will continue to be available in that way until suitable alternative arrangements are put in place.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I should like to share some of my time with Deputy Billy Timmins, with the agreement of the House.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise plans by Rentokil and South Dublin County Council to destroy seven cylinders of hydrogen cyanide in the Manor Kilbride area of west Wicklow.  I condemn the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for not being here for this important debate.  West Wicklow must not be allowed to become a new dumping ground for such dangerous and potentially lethal chemical waste.  There has been too much illegal dumping in that area in the past.I am calling on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to halt this crazy plan and to introduce legislation to deal properly with this issue.  It is astounding that the transport and disposal of such dangerous material has been kept secret from the public.  No licence has been issued by the EPA, no risk assessment has been published and there has been no public consultation with residents or local public representatives.  Hydrogen cyanide is a particularly dangerous chemical, once used as an agricultural poison.  Concentration of 300 mg of the gas in air would kill a person within a few minutes.  It is commonly listed among chemical warfare agents that cause general poisoning and it is listed under schedule 3 of the Chemical Weapons Convention as a potential weapon.  It was reportedly used in death camps in Nazi Germany and, more recently, in the genocide of the Kurds.  Rentokil approached South Dublin County Council about the destruction of its stock of hydrogen cyanide which is now decades old.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government then got involved and asked the Army to identify sites for the controlled burn or explosion of the chemicals.  Manor Kilbride in west Wicklow was chosen.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, is the responsible for that choice.This plan is all the more surprising because according to South Dublin County Council "the advice from chemical experts and manufacturers is that the cylinders are safe to remain in the building in their current condition and position".  If that is the case, why then embark on a risky procedure of burning the chemical and exposing people to potential risk and the area to potential pollution?  Army personnel have been told to vacate the Kilbride army camp for four days.  A 1 km wide exclusion zone is planned, although families living within that zone have not been properly informed.The lack of information and consultation has fuelled anxiety among local people and generated considerable alarm.  No risk assessment has been published.  That is simply unacceptable.  No environmental impact study has been published in accordance with EU directives covering the destruction of explosive substances which is probably illegal.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has the power to halt this plan and he should use it.Yesterday, I travelled the road from the Army's camp at Manor Kilbride.  It is a small country road with poor surfacing and potholes.  These conditions give rise to new concerns.  The transport of these cylinders carries great risk.  No such journey should take more than two hours.  If cylinders are disturbed in transit, they are prone to explosion.  I was contacted reluctantly by an expert in the risks attached to the transport of hydrogen cyanide.  If an explosion were to occur, he said he would not be able to forgive himself.  He was that conscientious but what about the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?If he were in the Chamber, I would say to him that the illegal dumping in west Wicklow did not happen on his watch but this disposal of highly toxic material by explosion will.  I urge the Minister to stop this madness and leave the material in situ for the time being where it will be safe.  He must prepare legislation to protect and inform the public instead of riding roughshod over the concerns of people in west Wicklow.

The substance is stored in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, at Ballymount industrial estate.  While I am not a chemicals expert, concerns have been raised over this disposal process.  This concern has been fuelled by the lack of information available and the disdain shown by the authorities for the population in west Wicklow.  It brings home the inefficiencies and remoteness of local government from the people it purports to serve.  People already have a mistrust of the authorities involved in the operation because they refused to engage with them at an earlier stage.  The operation was going to be carried out covertly, unknown to anyone.  Fortunately, information came to light.  Deputy McManus has covered the technical aspects of this operation.  I agree the disposal of such waste must be put on a statutory footing.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The Deputies' concerns have also been raised with me as a representative of the Brittas area.  Councillor John Hannon has taken the matter up directly with South Dublin County Council.Less than 1% of waste generated in Ireland in 2006 was hazardous but I accept this waste presents a significant threat to the environment and human health if it is not properly managed.  The necessary legislation concerning the management of waste, including hazardous waste, already exists.  Under the Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2008, a seamless chain of control exists covering general duties on producers or holders of waste, persons who collect or transport waste and concerning the disposal or recovery of waste.Under section 32, a person shall not hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution.  Where the holder carries out any transport, recovery or disposal, the relevant provisions of the Act for such activities apply with supervision or overall management of the activity being a matter for the relevant local authority, or the Environmental Protection Agency, as appropriate.  Local authorities have substantial powers to enable them to tackle problems associated with the disposal of hazardous waste.  Under section 55 of the Waste Management Act, a local authority has the power to order measures to be taken in the disposal of waste as they see fit.  Section 56 also empowers local authorities to directly take appropriate actions to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by waste.The Environmental Protection Agency has statutory responsibility for the preparation and review of the national hazardous waste management plan.  As part of the current review, a proposed plan, covering 2008 to 2012, has been through a public consultation process and is due to be published shortly.Under section 26 of the Waste Management Act, Ministers, local authorities and relevant public authorities are required to have regard to the plan and, when they consider it appropriate to do so, to take measures to implement or otherwise give effect to recommendations contained in it.Some 48% of the 284,000 tonnes of Irish hazardous waste generated is exported for treatment and disposal abroad, mostly for thermal treatment.  The balance is treated on-site at industrial facilities or in a network of 15 authorised hazardous waste treatment facilities in Ireland.  The primary objectives of the proposed national hazardous waste management plan are to prevent and minimise hazardous waste and to manage in an environmentally sound manner the hazardous waste which cannot be prevented.I presume the Deputies' interest in this matter is prompted by recent media reports concerning the management of hazardous material being held by a private company, Rentokil.  The company, as holder of the material, has the statutory responsibility to resolve this matter not only under the Waste Management Act 1996, but also under the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Acts 1989 and 2005, the Dangerous Substances Act 1972, the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 and accompanying regulations and licensing regimes.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has no function in this regard.

This followed a series of meetings held by Rentokil with South Dublin County Council, the Defence Forces, the fire services and An Garda Síochána to develop a solution for the disposal of the cylinders.  South Dublin County Council has taken the lead agency responsibility in this matter and has maintained appropriate contact with the relevant statutory authorities, including the Health and Safety Authority and the Environmental Protection Agency.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has written to the council requesting that it considers the steps it can take to ensure an appropriate resolution of this matter by Rentokil within the relevant regulatory requirements for waste management and disposal having regard to the hazard involved.On 10 June 2008, the council issued a press statement detailing the steps it would take as the lead agency in the disposal of the cylinders.  The council continues to work closely with all relevant agencies in dealing with this matter.

The increase in fatalities in the Fishing sector resulted from a number of well-publicised drowning tragedies.This year, to date, 30 work-related fatalities were reported to the Health and Safety Authority as follows:NumberAgriculture10Construction9Transportation and Storage3Wholesale and Retail trade & Repair of motor vehicles2Manufacturing2Water supply and Waste management1Public administration & Defence1Fishing1Other service activities1Ireland has an unusual statistical profile in relation to work-related injuries and fatalities. According to the latest statistics from Eurostat, which only refer to 2005, Ireland has one of the lowest rates of reported work-related injury while, at the same time, having one of the higher rates of fatalities.All fatalities in the workplace are a tragedy. Our rate is high and it is clear that a range of approaches is required to secure and maintain significant improvement.While the Health and Safety Authority has operational responsibility for advice, support and enforcement in the workplace safety arena, the reality is that the State on its own cannot deliver safety in the workplace. Safe workplaces can only be delivered by those who control and work in them.This year, targeted inspections by the Authority will be risk based. The aim is to target the Authority's resources effectively throughout 2008, focusing on prioritised workplaces, and those companies, regions and sectors with a poor compliance record.The following is a tabular statement on workplace fatal accidents for the years in question broken down by sector.Number of fatalities (worker and non-worker) by economic sector2004200520062007A — Agriculture, hunting and forestry13181811B — Fishing32212C — Mining and quarrying0622D — Manufacturing3744E — Electricity / gas / water0000F — Construction16231318G — Wholesale / retail trade; repair of goods4831H — Hotels and restaurants0000I — Transport, storage and communication6549J — Financial intermediation1000K — Real estate, renting, business0122L — Public Admin / Defence0214M — Education1000N — Health / social work1010O — Other community, social and personal services2214Total50745167
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 23 together.Ireland is a signatory to both International Labour Organisation Conventions No. 87 on the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise 1948 and No. 98 on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention 1949 since 1955 and Ireland's laws have been in compliance with these conventions since that date.  Ireland ratifies a convention only where our law and practice are in full conformity with it.To that extent, in ratification, the Conventions have the status of international treaties and Ireland is obliged to adhere to the core objectives established in each of the ILO Conventions, which must be reflected in national practice.  Specifically, the enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas across the full range of fundamental labour and social rights comprehends and underpins the realisation of the standards set in these ILO Conventions.  These objectives are also realised through the delivery of commitments entered into, for example, in National Partnership Agreements.  Ireland's continuing progress in the achievement of these goals issubject to ongoing review and evaluation by the ILO itself, in consultation with the Social Partners.The Irish Constitution guarantees the right to form and join trade unions. The Courts have upheld the right to take strike action subject only to regard for the legal and constitutional rights of the parties affected. Trade unions, their officials and members who are engaged in industrial action are granted immunity from criminal and civil liability in circumstances defined in the Industrial Relations Act 1990. Trade union representatives and workers are also protected against unfair treatment through provisions contained in the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007, the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and in the 1993 code of practice entitled "Duties and responsibilities of employee representatives and the protection and facilities afforded them by their employers".Trade unions who hold a negotiating licence are free to engage in collective bargaining on wages and conditions of employment, as are excepted bodies, essentially bodies whose workers are employed by the same employer and negotiate only on their own behalf. There is no legal or constitutional requirement for an employer to negotiate with a trade union, although the Courts have ruled that it is legitimate for a trade union to engage in industrial action in pursuit of recognition.Ireland's system of industrial relations is based on a voluntary approach with terms and conditions of employment being determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the parties, without the intervention of the State. The collective bargaining process can cover the entire range of issues arising from the employment relationship.The State has sought to facilitate the bargaining process through establishing, by legislation, a number of agencies to assist in the resolution of disputes.  These agencies are: the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner Service.  There are also statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary process in areas where the parties so wish.  The most important provisions are those concerning Joint Labour Committees and Registered Employment Agreements. In addition, the 2004 Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, provide mechanisms for the resolution of disputes in situations where collective bargaining does not occur and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used fail to resolve the dispute.The issue of collective bargaining and the arrangements necessary to support it, particularly having regard to trade union concerns about the operation of the legislation in this area, are under discussion with the social partners in the current social partnership discussions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 123 together.I am aware of the concerns raised in the Deputies' questions and in a number of surveys that consumers may not be experiencing the benefits of the Euro's appreciation in value, particularly against the dollar and sterling and I too share those concerns.Indeed the latest survey published by the National Consumer Agency yesterday comparing the price of a basket of grocery items in supermarkets north and south of the border show that the supermarkets concerned are charging customers in their stores in the Republic significantly more than what they are charging customers in their stores in Northern Ireland for the same basket of goods. The survey shows for instance that in the case of branded goods, the price charged to customers south of the border ranged from 28% to 31% higher than the price for the same goods north of the border. It is my strong view that retailers have a duty to their customers and to the economies in which they operate to explain why there are such price differentials between their stores in the two jurisdictions. I am not satisfied that we have as yet received adequate explanations for these price differentials.The Deputies may be aware that prior to carrying out its survey, the National Consumer Agency had, in bilateral discussions with retailers, raised its concerns that the benefits of the Euro's appreciation against the dollar and sterling were not being passed on to consumers. In the course of those discussions, retailers have advised that the benefits of recent exchange rate movements may not be fully reflected in their prices as in many instances they are tied into long term hedging arrangements, which do not make it possible for them to respond to short-term exchange rate fluctuations.Notwithstanding such considerations, the National Consumer Agency was of the view that in some instances the price charged by retailers reflects a price level that the retailer anticipates the Irish market will bear, and this may or may not take into account movements in exchange rates. The Agency's North/South survey illustrates the reality of the price differential between the two jurisdictions. I welcome the fact that the Agency will, in addition to its regular national Price Comparison Surveys, also conduct further cross border surveys of this nature. The findings of these surveys will help to show as to how competitive the retail marketplace is in the Republic. In addition, the publication of more regular and more comprehensive price information by the National Consumer Agency, and a willingness by consumers to act on that information, can play a key role in the development of a more competitive marketplace.Aside from the work of the National Consumer Agency, I also initiated an engagement with the retail sector to make it aware of the Government's serious concerns on this mater. In this regard, in the past number of weeks I have met separately with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and leading members of Retail Ireland, and have also written to major individual retailers.  I was advised at those meetings that, while the retail price of goods imported from the UK had lagged exchange rate movements due to factors such as the forward purchase of goods and currency, there had already been reductions in the price of some goods and further reductions were in the pipeline.  Whilst the Consumer Price Index data for the month to May 2008 show that there have been some reductions in the price of a number of goods such as breakfast cereals and biscuits known to have a significant UK import content, there is still a considerable way to go as these modest reductions do not reflect the scale of the currency movements between the Euro and Sterling.It is my intention to continue to constructively engage with the retail sector in the period ahead on this issue. I am determined to pursue the serious questions raised by surveys such as that carried out by the National Consumer Agency with a view to securing a satisfactory outcome for Irish consumers.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	606	In March 2008, the Government decided to reduce the administrative burden of domestic regulation on business by 25% by 2012.  Initially, all Government Departments will be required to list the Information Obligations which their regulations impose on business.  From that listing, Departments will assess which requirements are the most burdensome and will then measure the actual cost to business of the most burdensome requirements.  At that point the most appropriate approach to achieving the overall 25% target will be re-examined.  My Department is responsible for devising the approach and methodology to be used across Government, for coordinating the work across Government Departments and Agencies and for reporting to Government on progress.I would also like to draw attention to the work of the High-level Group on Business Regulation appointed in July 2007.  The Group has been examining concrete areas in which the administrative burden of regulations on business can be reduced.  The Group will present its initial report to me shortly. Some examples of the areas examined by the Group are:Audit Exemption: At the end of 2006, legislation was introduced to raise the audit exemption thresholds applying to small companies. Based on the likely number of companies availing of the exemption in 2007, annual savings are estimated at up to €16.5 million.Redundancy payments: The processes by which companies reclaim payments made to redundant workers have been streamlined and claims can now be made on-line.  Savings to firms as a result are estimated to be of the order of €1.2 million per annum.Tax Clearance Certificates:  Instead of having to submit the original certificate in hard copy, the certificate can now be checked on-line by the Government agency  awarding the contract.  Savings of the order of €300,000 annually are expected to accrue to businesses concerned.Waste collection permits: The Minister for the Environment has introduced new regulations whereby waste collection firms can apply to one local authority for a permit and which will apply in other local authority areas.  The total cost of the current system is approximately €8 million per annum.  The High-level Group intends to measure the savings when the new system has been in effect for a period.Companies Annual Return: Recently introduced electronic filing of the annual return to the Companies Registration Office has yielded savings to companies of €10 million annually based on take-up to date.The work of the High-level Group will contribute to the achievement of the Government's target.

Since its publication, work has been continuing with regard to clarification of certain legal points, operational arrangements after the enactment of legislation — including in relation to employment permits — and the extent to which particular commitments made in Towards 2016 are provided for in the legislation.  The Department has been engaged in ongoing discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, with colleagues in other Government Departments and Offices and with Social Partners in this regard.  Those discussions are continuing and because Parliamentary time is unlikely to be available this side of the Summer recess, the opportunity will be taken to finalise consideration of the Bill in the context of commitments in Towards 2016, operational issues arising post-enactment and any outstanding legal points.In the meantime, NERA remains active in the area of workplace inspections and enforcement of existing employment rights legislation.  In this regard, the Director has a budget allocation of  €10.817 million for 2008  (increased from €8.55 million for 2007). The budget provides for the pay and operational costs of some 141 personnel involved in inspection, enforcement and information provision activities in NERA's Carlow headquarters and in regional offices in Sligo, Dublin, Cork and Shannon.  It is intended that the National Employment Rights Authority will be established on a statutory basis one month after the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008 is signed into law by the President.

During the same period in 2007 some 4,587 inspections/visits/calls were undertaken.  Of the 9,852 inspections/visits/calls to date in 2008, breaches were detected in 1572 cases.  In 2007 breaches were detected in 795 cases. In 2008, €1,008,642 in underpayments of wages due to employees has been recovered by NERA Inspection Services compared to €818,801 for the corresponding period in 2007.  These outcomes point to the value of more focused and targeted activities being undertaken by NERA in relation to employment rights promotion and compliance and the increased number of NERA Inspectors.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 32  and 68 together.The report referred to by the Deputy was an internal FÁS report which was produced by the FÁS Board sub-committee on the construction/contracting sector and discussed by the FÁS Board.  It was produced to allow the Agency to respond in an appropriate and effective matter to ongoing developments in the construction industry and to assist workers who are made redundant.The report projects that employment in the construction sector will fall by 65,400 overall by the end of 2009.  This is due to the slowdown in new housing but over the same period new jobs will be created in the three other major sub-sectors of the construction industry (repair and maintenance, general contracting and civil engineering).  Further job gains are anticipated in future years according to the FÁS report.  We will have to wait to see if these projections are borne out by reality.  Employment in the Construction sector is currently at 274,400 (QNHS Quarter 1, 2008) showing a decrease of 3.4% or 9,800 jobs in the year.  However, there are now 18,700 more jobs in construction than there were two years ago.The Department of Finance is projecting new house completions of around 55,000 units this year.  In its Medium-Term Review, the ESRI foresees a continuing demand for new homes to 2025 with forecast housing completions at an average of 48,000 per year from 2010 to 2020.  So despite current difficulties in housing and construction, the economy needs to continue substantial investment in housing and infrastructure over the coming decade.  While the slowdown in new house building has resulted in an increase in unemployment, overall employment is forecast to continue to grow, albeit at a reduced rate than heretofore, thereby providing new job opportunities.There are a range of training opportunities available to those who lose their jobs in the construction sector to assist them find employment.  FÁS Training Services programmes offer a range of specific skills to workers and an individual career path plan can be developed with each redundant worker to assist him/her back into employment.  After 3 months on the live register those who are still unemployed are referred by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS to assist them into training or employment.FÁS is working through its own Employment Service and with the Local Employment Service provided by Area Based Partnerships to provide increased interviewing and caseload management capacity to respond to the increased numbers on the Live Register. Specifically, FÁS is implementing a range of short and medium term actions for those affected by the increase in unemployment and the construction slowdown such as:putting in place training to upskill construction workers in relation to emerging needs;business training and mentoring for workers from larger enterprises entering self-employment;developing measures to ensure continuity in the apprenticeship system;promoting access for mobile workers to construction jobs elsewhere in the EU, including the UK.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 67 together.In 2008 nearly €246 million is being invested in the provision of training and upskilling programmes for the unemployed.  This represents an increase of 5.7% on that spent in 2007.  This training ranges from basic bridging foundation courses to more advanced skills training and traineeship.  In addition to this €377 million will be spent on Community Employment schemes, which are specifically aimed at integrating the long-term unemployed into the workforce by providing work experience and training.  This represents an increase of 5.2% on that spent in 2007.Training for the unemployed is part of wider Government policy in the context of the Government Human Capital Priority commitments in the National Development Plan 2007-13.  Over the period of the NDP the Government will invest €7.7 billion in public funds to support training and skills development both for the unemployed and those who are in employment.  This is a significant increase when compared with the level of spending over the previous seven-year period (2000-2006) of €5.9 billion.  The current level of investment reflects the importance the Government attaches to developing and maintaining an educated, skilled and adaptable work force in Ireland.As part of this strategy, FÁS provides a range of services to the unemployed with particular emphasis on those who may have difficulty in accessing the labour market such as people with disabilities, women returnees and early school leavers.  The focus is on the provision of training and employment programmes, which will assist these groups to enter or re-enter the labour market or progress to further job-related training.In addition, FÁS provides an integrated support service for anyone made redundant.  This involves information sessions, skills analysis, training/retraining courses and job placement.  In the delivery of these services, FÁS liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the City/County Enterprise Boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  FÁS also works closely with the agencies to identify and support individuals who wish to start their own business.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The development of the knowledge-based economy is one of the key challenges and opportunities facing Ireland.  The factors which have contributed to our economic success to date will not be sufficient to sustain our recent achievements.  Increasing international competition is creating pressure for improvements in efficiency, quality and productivity and a growing need to innovate.  These pressures are increasing and it requires courageous, forward-looking steps to achieve real strategic change and show tangible medium-term results.The Government has made a major commitment, through the substantial investment set out in the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) and the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013, to making the transition to a knowledge economy and ensure Ireland's continued progress towards securing its position as one of the world's advanced knowledge economies.Investment in our people and ensuring that they have the skills required to live and work in the global knowledge economy is at the heart of the Government's strategy to progress towards a knowledge economy and society.  Similarly we need to ensure that enterprises in Ireland have the absorptive capacity to turn knowledge into products and services that can be competitive and that they develop the capabilities to undertake research and development work in-house and to link effectively with the generators of new knowledge in the higher education sector in Ireland and internationally.In this regard, the NDP sets out an investment of  €8.2 billion to 2013 to make this vision a reality, establishing Ireland as a key location for leading edge research and development, and a location for high quality jobs that are underpinned by knowledge and high skill levels.  The allocation of funding under the SSTI is predominantly on the basis of competitive funding calls and in general the programmes have no specific regional focus.  Given the competitive nature of funding calls, funding can be expected to correlate closely to demographic and infrastructural factors, in particular the distribution of third level research institutions (universities, institutes of technology, etc) within the country.Key to the Enterprise Development Agencies' Strategies for the South East Region is to progress the development of a knowledge-based economy, so that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment and the development of indigenous companies.  As part of the process of developing the capabilities of the region, the agencies work very closely with the Local Authorities, Chambers, and a range of private sector interests who supply business support services throughout the region.  The Agencies continue to work closely with the third level educational institutions in the region so that the skill-sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the region are being developed.  The agencies also maintain a close relationship with FÁS so that the requirements of industry particularly in the areas of training and upskilling are being met.The South East region has recorded good success in attracting firms in high technology sectors thereby encouraging the transition to a knowledge economy.  On the Life Sciences side, key project wins have included Genzyme (Waterford); Abbott and Boston Scientific (Clonmel); Waters Technology (Wexford), Cordis and Alza (Cashel); while several existing companies continue to contribute significantly to the employment base in the region, such as Bausch & Lomb (Waterford), IVAX (Waterford), Merck (Tipperary and Carlow), GlaxoSmithKline (Dungarvan) and Lake Region (New Ross).
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	612	Forecasting employment figures is a perilous business and subject to a variety of unforeseen, often extraneous, variables influencing estimates of that nature. However, I still expect employment growth — being the excess of jobs created over jobs lost — to continue in 2008, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years.  In the Budget Outlook employment is forecast to grow by over 1% in 2008.  The latest available employment data from CSO indicates that at Quarter Q1 2008 there were 53,700 additional people in employment compared with the corresponding period in 2007.  When seasonal factors are taken into account there was an increase in employment of 6,200 in the first quarter of this year which is a testament to the resilience of our economy at a time of uncertainty in global economic conditions, the continued strength of the euro and the downturn in the construction sector.The Irish economy is undergoing a certain amount of adjustment and while the rate of employment growth is expected to slow it must be viewed in the context of historically unprecedented numbers of people in work.  Since 1997, over half a million new jobs have been created in Ireland and the number in employment now exceeds 2.1 million.  In 2007 the Enterprise Development Agencies created 25,355 jobs across all sectors.The model of manufacturing in developed economies is changing and Irish enterprises are adapting to those changes and engaging in higher value added activities in order to compete in the global marketplace.  The services sector continues to provide significant new employment opportunities.  Earlier this year, my predecessor in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment launched the "Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing".  The Group's report contains 26 recommendations directed at key areas of innovation and productivity leading to transformational change, reskilling and management development for the innovative firm, increasing awareness and take up of existing supports.  Innovation and the productivity gains that flow from it are the new foundations for competitiveness.  Implementation of the Report of the High Level Group is being discussed with the social partners as part of the current review of the Partnership agreement "Towards 2016".Recognising the increased importance of services worldwide, as well as the increased international tradability of services, Forfás established a dedicated Services Strategy Group whose report will be finalised shortly.  From the work of this group we intend to prepare and position Irish enterprise to adapt to the globalisation of services with the aim of achieving sustainable and competitive services enterprise in Ireland.Competition for foreign direct investment (FDI) continues to be relentless but Ireland continues to punch above its weight when it comes to attracting overseas investment.  While costs are higher, we have responded by positioning ourselves as a location for more advanced activities, with more qualified and better paying jobs.  The pipeline of new business for which IDA Ireland is competing is as strong as at any time in recent years and we remain confident that Ireland is well placed to secure significant investment during 2008 and beyond from key target sectors such as Pharmaceuticals, Biopharma, Medical Technologies and Information and Communications Technology.Looking to the future, neither the Government nor my Department are complacent regarding the varied challenges facing the country's economy.  One of our main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain.  In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government.

The Hotels Joint Labour Committee met in March 2008 and a new Employment Regulation Order was subsequently made for the sector with effect from 23 May 2008.The implications of the issues raised during the course of the High Court challenge and any legislative changes that may be necessary to protect the integrity of the JLC system are matters which are under consideration in the current social partnership discussions.  I would like to assure the Deputy of the Government's ongoing commitment to ensuring that there are adequate systems and processes in place to underpin employment standards.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	614	Department Decentralisation.  My Department has been making good progress in the relocation of the required 250 posts to Carlow under the Government's Decentralisation Programme.  The following business units/Offices of my Department are earmarked for decentralisation:Companies Registration Office/Registry of Friendly Societies;National Employment Rights Authority (NERA);Work Permits;Redundancy Payments Section;Insolvency Payments Section.Officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units opened an advance office in Carlow on July 30th 2007.  The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 100.  As well as staff already decentralised, there are 48 staff within my Department due to decentralise in the substantive move scheduled for 2009, with a further 42 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned from other Departments.With regard to the property side of the Department's move, the OPW completed the purchase of a site in Carlow town centre for the construction of my Department's permanent office in Carlow.  My colleague Minister of State Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13th December 2007 that the OPW has invited The Macquarie Partnership as the consortium to become the ‘Successful Tenderer' in respect of this decentralisation project.  This forms part of a major PPP project, which also involves the provision of office accommodation for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in Portlaoise and the Department of Education and Science in Mullingar.The OPW has advised my Department that the formal application for planning permission was lodged with Carlow Town Council on Friday 18th April 2008.  I am hopeful, subject to no planning issues arising, that the completion of construction of the permanent office will be in late 2009.Agency Decentralisation.Under the Government Decentralisation Programme, announced in December 2003, six of the Agencies under the aegis of my Department are due to decentralise or have already been decentralised, as follows:National Consumer Agency (NCA).The National Consumer Agency (NCA) was formally established on 1st May 2007 and inherited the functions of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs (ODCA).  The Agency will have a headquarters in Cork City.  The Department of Finance has granted sanction for an overall complement of 80 members of staff.  The NCA expects that there will be over 90% staff turnover as many of the existing staff, who formerly worked in ODCA and are on secondment from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, return to the Department.  Decentralisation plans are being progressed with a view to the Agency relocating to Cork in the course of 2009.  The Agency has forwarded details of its accommodation requirements to the OPW and hopes to shortly identify a suitable property in Cork.FÁSFÁS is due to transfer its Head Office including some 383 posts to Birr, County Offaly.  FÁS has completed the purchase of 5.59 acres (approximately) in Birr, Co Offaly.  A Planning Application is currently being progressed on behalf of FÁS by the vendor's Consultant Engineers and Architects, in discussion with the Consulting Engineers and Architects representing FÁS.  In the meantime, since 6 May 2007 FÁS has leased a floor of a building within the Birr Technology Centre to accommodate staff in the decentralised location pending the construction and fitting out of the permanent Headquarters.  There are currently 22 Head Office staff based in these premises, which has capacity for approximately 40 staff.Enterprise IrelandEnterprise Ireland (EI) is to move 300 posts to Shannon under the decentralisation programme.  Progress on the full transfer of EI's HQ to Shannon, within the Government decentralisation programme, will be influenced by factors (many exogenous to EI) such as the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and by progress made discussions at a central level on various issues central to Agency decentralisation.  EI's latest understanding is that there are 7 internal applicants interested in moving to Shannon.  None of these has yet re-located.  In parallel with the decentralisation programme, EI has been strengthening its regional focus in recent years.  EI now has a major new presence in the Shannon region in addition to its nine other regional offices.  In July 2007 EI officially opened its new National Regional Development Headquarters in Shannon and has based the new County Enterprise Support Unit there.  Currently there are 40 staff working in the new Shannon office and it is expected that approximately 65 EI staff will be in place there over the coming months.  EI has leased high-spec office space in Westpark, Shannon, to accommodate this new Regional HQ.  In terms of acquiring a building, Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW) has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a suitably sized new HQ building in Shannon.  The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development.  In co-operation with Shannon Development and the OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out.  The site occupies a prime position in Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure.Health and Safety AuthorityThe Health and Safety Authority (HSA) is to move 110 posts to Thomastown, Co Kilkenny as part of the decentralisation programme. In anticipation of the move to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city and to date 27 staff decentralised to that office are awaiting transfer to Thomastown, when the new premises there are completed.  The current situation is that the Thomastown site purchase is about to be completed.  No premises occupation date has yet been agreed with the OPW.NSAIUnder the Government's decentralisation programme the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) is due to relocate to Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  The number required to decentralise from the NSAI is 132.  A total of 10 staff of the NSAI have applied to decentralise to Arklow.  In addition a further 86 civil and public servants have applied for decentralisation to Arklow.  No staff from the NSAI has transferred to Arklow to date.  The accommodation requirements for the NSAI in Arklow are being addressed by the OPW.  To date no progress has been made by the OPW in identifying or securing suitable office accommodation in the Arklow area.  The current NSAI implementation plan anticipates a target date of April 2009 as the completion date.Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA)In the case of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), a decision was made prior to its establishment that it would be located in Naas, Co Kildare.  Having been established in December, 2005 it moved to new offices at Naas, in January 2006. All IAASA staff have been based in its offices in Naas since its establishment, and as such the Authority is fully decentralised.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 41 together.The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 was revoked by the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 with effect from 20th March 2006.  During the debate that surrounded the removal of the Order my predecessor, Mr. Micheál Martin, indicated that increased competition in the market should lead to prices being cheaper than they would be if the Order remained in place.Following the enactment of the 2006 Act, Minister Martin asked the Competition Authority to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  In its Report, "Price Trends in the Irish Retail Grocery Sector: A Description of the Evolution of Retail Grocery Prices between 2001 and 2007", published in March 2008, the Authority reports that during the initial nine month period, April to December 2006, following the removal of the Groceries Order, the price trends for Groceries Order items and Non-Groceries Order items behave very differently.  The price trends move in opposite directions, with the price of Groceries Order items falling and the price of Non-Groceries Order items rising.This is the first time that such a divergence between the Groceries Order items and non-Groceries Order items occurred since 2001.  The Authority's view is that this may indicate that a structural change has occurred in the price trends for Groceries Order items and Non-Groceries Order items and may reflect a period of price adjustment by retailers who were free to use price enticements to compete.However, since the beginning of 2007 the price trends for Groceries Order items and Non-Groceries Order items appear to behave similarly, with both trends rising.  Towards the end of 2007, the rise in the price of Groceries Order items is steeper.  This trend however is not an issue particular to Ireland as rising food prices are being experienced right across the world due to a number of factors including climatic, economic and demand reasons.The global biofuel industry is causing fundamental changes to agricultural markets and is likely to keep the prices of agricultural commodities high over the next decade.  A rise in input and transportation costs consequent on increased fuel and energy prices has also contributed to the increase in biofuel production.  The resulting loss of significant tracts of potential food-producing land in favour of the bio-fuel industry has pushed up the cost of the animal feed used by dairy farmers.  This has also coincided with surging demand for meat and dairy produce in India and China, as their economies and diets become more westernised.  Nearer to home, persistent rain in Ireland last summer had a significant effect on crops such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli with up to 50% of some growers' yields being severely affected.  Grain prices in Ireland continue to rise with the realisation that wheat harvests in most regions did not deliver as expected which in turn has increased the price of barley.  In terms of food prices into the future, it is likely that the demand, economic and climatic reasons which underlie the recent price increases may continue to be experienced for some time.Government policy insofar as the price of food to Irish consumers is concerned, is focused on promoting a competitive grocery market and raising consumer awareness in relation to the need to get the best value for money when doing their grocery shopping.  In this regard, the National Consumer Agency has carried out a Grocery Price Comparison Survey in the area of food prices.  The results of the survey found that food prices are on a strong upward trend primarily due to international factors.  The Agency concluded that consumers can force more competition in the grocery sector by informing themselves of the prices of products charged by different retailers and shopping around, if they have sufficient choice, and not necessarily doing a "weekly shop" in the one outlet.

The Act also empowers the Agency to review or approve Codes of Practice submitted to it by traders or their trade associations where the Agency is satisfied that the Code of Practice protects consumer interests.The Agency is currently giving priority to finalising Guidelines for business in two specific areas namely, the Retail Sector and the Health and Fitness Sector.  I wish to acknowledge the constructive manner in which the Agency is engaging with business.  I also fully support the stated intention of the Agency to continue to promote robust Codes of Practice covering various aspects of business activity over time.I welcome the positive steps taken by the Agency in working with traders and their representative associations to develop a strong consumer culture amongst Irish business.  I am certain that the development of such a culture through initiatives such as Agency Guidelines and Consumer Codes of Practice will be to the benefit of not only consumers but also the businesses themselves and the economy as a whole.

The Courts have upheld the right to take strike action subject only to regard for the legal and constitutional rights of the parties affected.  Trade unions, their officials and members who are engaged in industrial action are granted immunity from criminal and civil liability in circumstances defined in the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Trade union representatives and workers are also protected against unfair treatment through provisions contained in the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007, the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and in the 1993 code of practice entitled "Duties and responsibilities of employee representatives and the protection and facilities afforded them by their employers".Trade unions who hold a negotiating licence are free to engage in collective bargaining on wages and conditions of employment. Ireland's system of industrial relations is based on a voluntary approach with terms and conditions of employment being determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the parties, without the intervention of the State.  The collective bargaining process can cover the entire range of issues arising from the employment relationship.The State has sought to facilitate the bargaining process through establishing, by legislation, a number of agencies to assist in the resolution of disputes.  These agencies are: the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner Service.  There are also statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary process in areas where collective bargaining does not operate effectively.  The most important provisions are those concerning Joint Labour Committees and Registered Employment Agreements.  In addition, the 2004 Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, provide mechanisms for the resolution of disputes in situations where collective bargaining does not occur and the internal dispute resolution procedures normally used fail to resolve the dispute.The issue of collective bargaining and the arrangements necessary to support it, particularly having regard to trade union concerns about the operation of the legislation in this area, are under discussion with the social partners in the current social partnership discussions.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	618	I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 44 and 48 together.The number of deaths recorded in workplace accidents during 2007 was 67 compared to 51 in 2006.  Of these, 18 occurred in the construction sector in 2007, an increase of 5 on the 2006 figures.In terms of injuries, there were over 7,000 non-fatal work injuries overall reported to the Health and Safety Authority (Authority) which has operational responsibility for promoting health and safety in the workplace, in 2007.  The most common non-fatal accident triggers for all sectors were handling, lifting and carrying (34%), and slips, trips and falls (18%).  These have repeatedly been the two most common categories every year since 2000.  However, there has been a steady decrease in the number of injuries reported to the Authority each year since 2004.There have been 30 workplace deaths reported to the Authority so far in 2008.  For the first six months in each of the following years the figures are 36 in 2007, 24 in 2006, 32 in 2005, 24 in 2004, 38 in 2003 and 25 in 2002.  2008 showed signs of improvement but April was a particularly bad month with 10 workplace deaths, 4 of which were in construction and 3 in agriculture.  The last time such a high figure was recorded in a single month was January 2007.  Construction and agriculture are consistently the most dangerous areas in which to work with 19 of the 30 deaths so far this year attributed to these sectors.To date in 2008, a total of 2,894 non-fatal accidents, resulting in absence of more than three days from normal work, were reported to the Authority across all sectors.  This compares to 3,865 non-fatal accidents reported in the first six months of 2007, 4,001 for the same period in 2006, 3,841 for the same period in 2005, 3,419 for the same period in 2004, 2,096 for the same period in 2003 and 1,823 for the same period in 2002.It is important to remember that it is not the State which delivers safety at work.  Safe Workplaces can only be delivered by those who work in them.  Responsibility for Safety at Work rests ultimately on the shoulders of employers and employees.  That said, I am on record as having voiced the Government's concerns at the increase in fatalities both generally and in the construction sector.  The Health and Safety Authority shares those concerns and continues to focus its inspection and awareness campaigns on construction and other high-risk sectors.  Also, the Authority continues to work with employer and employee organisations to make workplace safety, health and welfare an integral part of doing business in every workplace.Based on its own risk assessment, it is prioritising the high-risk sectors of agriculture, construction, transportation and storage, mines and quarries.  In relation to the construction sector, the Authority has plans to carry out 7,000 construction site inspections in 2008.  Also, it will continue to implement the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 and the Safe System of Work Plan (SSWP).The Authority, following consultation with its stakeholders, has launched a comprehensive Construction Safety Code of Practice for Contractors with Three or Less Employees, which is a further tool in advocating safe practice in the workplace.  I also understand that a Code of Practice on scaffolding safety is due for publication shortly and the Authority also has plans to develop, consult on and publish codes of practice on construction anchors, pre-cast concrete and roof work in 2008.In addition to this, I formally launched the Construction Safety Partnership Plan 2008-2010 on Tuesday, 17th June 2008.  The Construction Safety Partnership (CSP) includes representatives of the Construction Industry Federation (CIF), Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), Health and Safety Authority (HSA) and other relevant agencies and Government Departments and its overall aim is to achieve the highest possible standard of safety health and welfare in Irish construction.

The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.The Boards are widely dispersed geographically and provide a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses.

Subject to certain eligibility criteria enterprises may access assistance and support from the CEBs.  The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.The table below provides details of the number of new jobs created by individual CEBs for each of the years 2004 through to 2007, as requested by the Deputy.  The data is available on the yearly net increase or decrease in the number of full-time equivalent jobs created in CEB assisted companies.  My Department does not collect or retain information on the number of specific job losses in CEB assisted companies either locally or by region.  Data in respect of 2008 job creation figures will not be available until early 2009.County and City Enterprise Boards2004200520062007TotalsCarlow-24.0060.0087.0032.50155.50Cavan133.5063.5057.00125.50379.50Clare36.5086.0082.50114.50319.50Cork City11.00-23.5010.00231.00228.50Cork North-3.5012.008.0067.5084.00Cork South27.00-25.00-14.5094.0081.50Cork West53.0059.5023.007.00142.50Donegal407.00-33.50175.50245.00794.00Dublin City-17.00198.00273.5033.50488.00Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown84.50-48.5053.00171.00260.00Fingal94.5013.5074.00125.50307.50Galway County/City47.50130.5032.00223.00433.00Kerry15.5026.5031.0059.00132.00Kildare24.5062.0043.00147.00276.50Kilkenny63.00109.50127.50-81.00219.00Laois55.5069.5066.003.00194.00Leitrim44.5053.5029.00-34.5092.50Limerick City-39.0042.5034.50105.50143.50Limerick County71.5020.0015.50-23.5083.50Longford8.5052.5036.5055.00152.50Louth78.50220.0054.00-95.00257.50Mayo90.5052.50110.0046.00299.00Meath45.5092.0085.002.00224.50Monaghan-13.5090.00165.0068.00309.50Offaly86.5049.50-33.5097.50200.00Roscommon31.5054.0085.5059.00230.00Sligo-19.50-41.5063.0043.0045.00South Dublin-117.0017.5079.0024.003.50Tipperary (NR)35.5019.0020.5025.00100.00Tipperary (SR)65.50-40.5048.00122.00195.00Waterford City-132.5062.5042.50-34.50-62.00Waterford County45.0041.5063.0029.50179.00Westmeath163.00100.004.0081.00348.00Wexford6.50210.0035.5087.50339.50Wicklow-67.5082.50-18.509.506.00Totals1,392.001,937.502,047.002,265.007,641.50
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	620	Ministers of twenty-seven EU Member States reached political agreement at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 9/10 June 2008, on the longstanding issues of the Temporary Agency Work and the Working Time Directives.  The Council Common Position on both these Directives will now be submitted to the European Parliament, as foreseen by the co-decision procedure.Under the agreement reached at Council, the basic working and employment conditions of temporary agency workers shall be, for the duration of their assignment at a user undertaking, at least those that would apply if they had been recruited directly by that undertaking to do the same job.  The agreement also provides the possibility to establish arrangements concerning the basic pay and working conditions which derogate from this principle of equal treatment by way of collective agreements as comprehended under the provisions of Article 5.3 and through agreements concluded by the social partners, at the national level, as comprehended under the provisions of Article 5.4 of the proposed Directive.  Other aspects of the Common Position agreed by EU Ministers include the review of prohibitions and restrictions on temporary agency work as envisaged under the provisions of Article 4 of the proposed Directive.  Under the terms of the agreement reached by EU Ministers, there is a three year period proposed in which Member States will be required to transpose the Directive, following adoption, into national legislation.It is the intention of Government to discuss with the Social Partners the arrangements most appropriate to Irish circumstances, having regard to the choices of agency workers, the framework provided for in the Directive and the need for flexibility at different levels.  An agreement in this area is a matter for the Social Partners but the State will, of course, have a role not least with regard to broad public policy on maintaining flexible employment opportunities and the rights of those employed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The issue of whether or not there should be provisions for "whistleblowing" (and related protection of the whistleblower from penalisation), specifically in the context of breaches of company law, was considered by the Company Law Review Group (CLRG), as part of its 2007 Work Programme.The CLRG is the statutory body appointed to advise the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in relation to company law matters. The Director of Corporate Enforcement is a member of the CLRG.  The CLRG's Report on its 2007 Work Programme has been submitted to me for consideration.  In accordance with the statutory requirements, the Report has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.The CLRG concluded that the balance of risks involved is weighted heavily against proceeding to insert specific whistleblowing provisions in the Companies Act and that there is no compelling public policy interest at stake.  The benefits of creating such provisions are not justified by the extent of company law malpractice or by their likely effectiveness.  Given the international regulatory situation, there is no economic rationale to support Ireland's being in the vanguard on this issue.  Finally, taking account of the reputational risk to companies and the extra resources, or diversion of resources, in respect of the enforcement agencies, the CLRG's majority recommendation is that a company law-specific "whistleblowing" provision should not be included in the new Companies Bill.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 119 and 121 together.I share Deputies' concerns about recent increases in the price of goods and services.  The greater part of those increases have resulted from global factors over which Government here has little or no influence.  Approximately 60 per cent of the rise in the Consumer Price Index in the year to May 2008 was attributable to rises in the price of fuels, food and mortgage interest rates.Measured on a harmonised basis, our inflation rate in the year to May 2008 was 3.7 per cent, the same as the euro area average and below the EU average of 3.9 per cent.  Only 5 member states recorded a lower annual inflation rate over this period.  Though we all obviously wish that price rises here were lower, these figures show that our current inflation performance is on a par with that in comparable countries and is, if anything, a little better than the EU norm.The increase in food prices over the past year is a particular cause for concern as these bear most heavily on less well-off households.  In the year to May 2008, the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages, as measured by Consumer Price Index data compiled by the CSO, increased by 7.8 per cent.  This increase is mainly due to the international rise in commodity and energy prices. Food prices have risen sharply in virtually all parts of the world with serious effects on some developing countries in particular.Though there is no doubt that consumers are paying more for food products, it is not correct to say that food producers are all being paid less.  The most recent CSO data on the prices paid to farmers for agricultural produce show substantial increases in cereal and milk prices in particular.  Though input costs have also risen significantly and farmers will maintain that a disproportionate share of the retail price of food products still goes to processors and retailers, it should be acknowledged that farm gate prices have risen considerably for some products.Though I am reluctant to make forecasts about future price developments, particularly in a sector as prone to price volatility as food, there is evidence that food price inflation has begun to moderate.  The cumulative increase of 1.4 per cent in food prices in the three months to May 2008, for example, was half the increase of 2.8 per cent in the three months to April 2008.  The Consumer Price Index data for May 2008 also showed reductions over the preceding month in the price of a number of food items such as eggs, breakfast cereals, cheese and biscuits.  Though food prices remain subject to considerable uncertainty and are very unlikely to return to the lower values of the past, there is reason to believe that the level of price increase over the next year will not mirror that of the last twelve months.Consumer prices in Ireland cannot escape the effects of global increases in commodity and energy prices and it would be misleading to pretend otherwise.  What we can do domestically is to work to promote greater competition in the retail sector and to encourage and empower consumers to use their purchasing power to put pressure on retailers to compete on price with their rivals.  The Government have asked the Competition Authority to monitor the operation of the grocery trade on an ongoing basis in respect of matters such as the competitive structure of the wholesale and retail sectors and the analysis of price trends.At my meeting with senior officials of the National Consumer Agency on 21 May, we agreed on the need for more frequent and extensive price surveys, including surveys comparing prices here and in Northern Ireland of the kind published yesterday.  The findings of that survey underline the need for more effective competition in the retail sector.  The publication of more regular and more comprehensive price information by the National Consumer Agency, and a willingness by consumers to act on that information, have an important part to play in the development of a more competitive retail marketplace.  The meeting with the NCA also discussed the reluctance of retailers generally to reduce the prices of goods imported from the UK in line with the appreciation of the euro against sterling.  Subsequent to that discussion, I have taken a  number of steps to bring the Government's concerns on this matter to the direct attention of retailers. I will continue to engage with retailers on this issue, and on any other issue where such engagement is warranted, in the interests of securing a satisfactory outcome for Irish consumers.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	623	The number of calls/visits/inspections carried out in relation to the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 during which breaches of the Act were detected and the number of prosecutions initiated is as follows:-in 2006: 2,002 calls/visits/inspections were undertaken; in 104 cases breaches were detected and in one case a prosecution was initiated.in 2007: 1,942 calls/visits/inspections were undertaken; in 192 cases breaches were detected and no prosecutions were initiated.to date in 2008: 1,630 calls/visits/inspections have been undertaken; in 124 cases breaches have been detected and no prosecutions have been initiated.NERA undertook a targeted campaign, which focused on compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, during the period 14 April to 11 May 2008.  Such campaigns, accompanied by awareness and promotional activities, are a significant feature of the National Employment Rights Authority's employment rights compliance and information strategy.The primary role of the National Employment Rights Authority in the case of breaches of employment rights legislation, is to seek compliance and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the employees concerned and payment of any arrears due to those employees.It should be noted that in the majority of cases employers rectify breaches of employment law and pay underpayments of wages due to employees without prosecution.  However, the National Employment Rights Authority reserves the right to initiate prosecutions in respect of breaches of certain employment legislation.  The Deputy should be aware that Rights Commissioners of the Labour Relations Commission also hear complaints concerning breaches of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	624	Last year my Department responded to the Director's request for additional staffing resources by increasing the approved Departmental staff complement from 30 to 38.  In addition, approved Garda staff numbers were also increased by one in 2007 bringing the total approved staffing complement of the ODCE to 46 posts.Four of the additional 8 Departmental staff were provided to the ODCE in 2007 and a further 2 were provided in early 2008 and, I expect that my Departmental commitment to providing a further 2 will be fully met by the end of July 2008.  This commitment is contingent on securing a release date for one staff member currently employed by another Department.  The Director indicated to my Department in late 2007 that having integrated these additional staff, he would review his request for further extra staff at the end of the 2008 and advise my Department at that stage of the results of that review.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 72 together.Unemployment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey, collated and published by the CSO.  The latest release on 5th June for Quarter 1 2008 (Dec-Feb 2008) shows that there are now 102,100 people unemployed, an increase of 8,700 in the year.  The current rate of unemployment is 4.6%.Employment has grown by 2.6% or 53,800 in the year to the first quarter of 2008 and, despite the slowdown in the economy, it is forecast to continue to grow this year by 24,000.  The latest Live Register release on 10th June, relating to the month of May, recorded 201,756 are signing on.  The Live Register is not designed to measure unemployment as it includes part-time, seasonal and casual workers entitled to unemployment benefit.The increase in the live register is not unexpected following on particularly from the slowdown in the construction industry.  This increase must be seen in the context of the substantial increase in employment by 224,300 in the three-year period since 2005.  The number of people currently in employment is 2,135,100.  It is generally accepted that the strong rate of growth experienced over the past few years could not continue and the economy is now entering a period of adjustment.The most recent FÁS/ESRI Employment and Vacancies Survey for April 2008 shows that the percentage of firms reporting vacancies across all sectors is 7%, indicating that there is not a collapse in employment opportunities.  After 3 months on the live register those who are still unemployed are referred by Department of Social and Family Affairs to FÁS to assist them into training or employment.FÁS is working through its own Employment Service and with the Local Employment Service provided by Area Based Partnerships to provide increased interviewing and caseload management capacity to respond to the increased numbers on the Live Register.  The range of integrated support services provided by FÁS also involves information sessions, skills analysis, training/retraining courses and job placement.  These services will be available for those who become redundant because of company restructuring or closures.Specifically, FÁS is implementing a range of short and medium term actions for those affected by the increase in unemployment and the construction slowdown such as:putting in place training to upskill construction workers in relation to emerging needs;business training and mentoring for workers from larger enterprises entering self-employment;developing measures to ensure continuity in the apprenticeship system;promoting access for mobile workers to construction jobs elsewhere in the EU, including the UK.FÁS is also working on increasing its market share of vacancies in the employment market through a range of marketing efforts.  As a result, vacancies notified to FÁS in 2007 increased by 12%.  In the delivery of these services, FÁS liaises with other relevant agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the City/County Enterprise Boards and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	626	The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) was asked, as part of its Work Programme for 2007, to examine the issue of "Limited Liability Partnerships" (LLPs).  This follows from concerns, particularly of the legal profession, about the consequences of unlimited liability on partners in a firm.The Report of the CLRG on its 2007 Work Programme has been presented to me and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.In its Report, the CLRG outlines the problems which current partnership law is perceived to cause for certain types of business organisation in Ireland and concludes that the problems are real and substantial. CLRG explores how the introduction of LLP legislation could address these problems and the types of safeguards which might need to be put in place to protect clients, customers and third parties generally, in their dealings with LLPs. The CLRG also considers whether the problems raised by current partnership law can be resolved by other means, without the need to amend the law of partnership.The CLRG came to the conclusion that a final decision on whether LLPs should be introduced, and on the shape and form which LLP legislation should take, can only be reached after a full consultation process involving all of those affected by the issues arising.  To that end the CLRG's Report poses a series of questions and the Review Group intends to reconsider the matter based on the responses to those questions.  I await the CLRG's further examination of the issue.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	627	The National Consumer Agency was established on a statutory basis on the commencement of the Consumer Protection Act 2007 on the 1st May 2007. The Act gave the Agency a significantly expanded remit with specific functions in areas such as consumer advocacy, research, information, education and awareness and enforcement.In the 12 months since its establishment, the Agency has been very active in the exercise of its expanded remit.  For example, in the area of consumer information, the Agency has undertaken high profile campaigns to inform consumers about their rights, including the Shoppers' Rights Card and the Know your Rights campaigns which have resulted in a doubling of calls to the Agency's dedicated helpline to almost 70,000 calls in 2007 alone. In addition the Agency has produced a range of booklets to advise consumers of their rights including advice in relation to Toy Safety, Buying a Car etc.In the area of consumer awareness, the Agency has dedicated considerable resources in the last year to raising the awareness of consumers in relation to the price that they pay for goods and services, particularly in relation to the price of grocery items. The Agency's latest Grocery Price Survey, the results of which were published at the end of February 2008, represented the most comprehensive survey of grocery prices and retail grocery outlets conducted in Ireland with the exception of the surveys carried out by the Central Statistics Office. Research carried out by the Agency has found that a significant number of consumers have already changed their shopping behaviour on the basis of the results of the Agency's surveys. The Agency is committed to continue to conduct such surveys so as to provide consumers with the necessary information to enable them to make informed choices in relation to where they can get the best value for the goods that they buy.In the area of advocacy, the Agency has been particularly active in advocating the consumer's case on a range of issues and with a number of different traders. In this regard, the Agency successfully negotiated on behalf of 2,500 concertgoers with the promoter of a concert for varying levels of compensation arising out of difficulties experienced at that concert.  The Agency also successfully intervened to advocate on behalf of consumers who had booked flights to the USA at a particular price which the airline was not prepared to honour. The Agency is currently advocating on behalf of broadband users and is working in co-operation with the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and the Communications Regulator to address difficulties in relation to the manner in which broadband services are advertised, particularly in the areas of service delivery and performance. Another advocacy initiative undertaken by the Agency was the establishment of its Stakeholder Forum on Multi Unit Developments. The aim of the Forum is, through the involvement of the various stakeholders, to try to address some of the problems being experienced by dwellers of Multi Unit Developments. As a result of the work of the Forum, the Agency hopes to publish specific Guidance and Educational material to assist Multi Unit Development dwellers.In the area of research, the Agency has commissioned a major piece of research in relation to the home construction industry and the problems faced by consumers in relation to certain aspects of that industry. The Agency expects to publish the results of this research before the end of the year.As regards enforcement, the Agency has sought to concentrate its enforcement efforts in those areas where there is greatest consumer detriment.  A particular focus has been placed on the area of "car clocking" which is of serious concern.  The Agency successfully prosecuted one car dealer and obtained a formal undertaking from another dealer to cease the practice of car clocking and to compensate customers who had been adversely affected by the practice.  The Agency intends that car clocking will continue to be a priority. The Agency has also been very active in the area of product safety and in particular in relation to the process of product recalls. The Agency has focussed particularly on toy safety and in this regard recently convened a major seminar on this issue. As regards other enforcement activity, the Agency has successfully prosecuted 11 traders for breaches of Consumer legislation and served 16 fixed payment notices since the commencement of the Consumer Protection Act in May 2007. It has also issued 7 compliance orders and received 3 undertakings.I am satisfied that the Agency is embracing the full breath of its statutory remit and is acting as a forceful advocate on behalf of consumers. I wish to pay tribute to the Agency and its staff for the manner in which they are redressing the balance of power more towards the consumer. I am confident that the Agency, working on behalf of Irish consumers, will ensure that the consumers' interests will continue to be at the forefront of the national agenda.

I have discussed the matter with the Director General of FÁS and the issue has also been raised at a recent meeting of the FÁS Board.The issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General had been previously identified in a report by the FÁS Internal Audit Unit which was subsequently forwarded by FÁS to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The issues identified in the report arose in the period 2002-2005.FÁS has taken a number of steps in response to its internal audit report, on which the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is based, by strengthening its procedures and internal financial controls.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	629	A fundamental review of the role and functions of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in the development of micro-enterprises, including the level of financial assistance which they have available to them, was conducted during 2004 on behalf of the Department by Fitzpatricks and Associates, Economic Consultants.  The Review recommended that, in providing assistance to micro-enterprises, CEBs should focus more on economic, rather than social or local development, objectives; that there should be a renewed focus on the core enterprise mission; that the issues of potential deadweight, displacement and duplication should be more systematically and rigorously addressed and that there should be a move away from direct grant aid to repayable finance as well as a greater provision of soft supports as an alternative to grant aid.  In the context of its key policy role my Department, in association with the CEB Central Co-ordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland and with the CEBs, monitors the range of support services offered by the CEBs on an ongoing basis particularly in the light of the economic climate.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 71 together.Management of Waterford Wedgwood plc requested support to assist in the implementation of its restructuring plan at Waterford Crystal.  Detailed discussions were held with the company with a view to identifying possible interventions that would assist them to successfully complete the planned restructuring in Waterford, while not undermining the policy position that has underpinned our enterprise development strategies over the last 20 years or so.The thrust of this enterprise strategy is to concentrate State support to firms for investments which will help them to compete successfully in an increasingly globalised economy.  The Government sees its role as helping to create an economic environment where business can prosper, focusing on interventions that are related to developmental investment by companies, such as R&D grants, support for upskilling, etc.  Such policy does not extend to providing the type of support sought by the Company in this case.While it was not possible to accede to the Company's request for assistance, the Government believes that there is a solid future for a restructured Waterford Crystal operation in Ireland and has asked that the Board of Waterford Wedgwood, its management and its staff work together to agree such financial and other measures as are necessary for the successful implementation of the restructuring plan. Any request or proposal from the Company for aid for future new investment will be considered sympathetically by the enterprise development agencies, as appropriate.Following the announcement of the restructuring programme at Waterford Crystal in November 2007, FÁS engaged directly with the company and with staff representatives to discuss the range of services that could be made available to the workers.  The agency agreed to establish a sustained service on-site at the company offering the agency's full range of supports.FÁS also works in co-operation with other agencies to maximise the opportunities for affected staff, in particular with Waterford Institute of Technology and the VEC in the provision of appropriate Adult Education options, and to facilitate longer duration development for those who wish to avail of it.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The role of the thirty-five County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs provide a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses. The CEBs can support individuals, firms and community groups provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  The CEBs continue to actively develop indigenous micro-enterprises throughout the regions.A particular advantage of the CEB structure is their local base which enables them to act as one-stop shops to assist entrepreneurs with business start ups.  The local orientation of the CEBs has been extremely effective in harnessing an entrepreneurial culture at local level.  The CEBs are very active within their own localities and liaise with a range of community and business interests and in so doing they are able to increase an awareness of their services within their geographical remit.  In addition the CEBs have, in recent years, significantly increased their national profile through the development of a generic branding logo, the development of a CEB network website and events such as the National Enterprise Awards, the Student Enterprise Awards and the National Women's Enterprise Day.The CEB Central Co-ordination Unit (CCU) was recently established within Enterprise Ireland (in the last quarter of 2007) to provide a level and range of strategic supports to the CEBs.  These supports will ultimately enhance the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the CEBs on the future development of micro-enterprise in Ireland.  In fulfilling its role the CCU will identify and recommend to my Department procedures, programmes and interventions that will ensure a professional delivery of quality programmes across the CEB network.  Potential new initiatives, such as the possibility of a direct marketing campaign, will be evaluated by the Unit in this context if such a need is identified.  However all such initiatives will remain subject to the constraints of normal budgetary considerations.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 prohibits anti-competitive practices, such as price fixing, by "undertakings".  An "undertaking" is defined in the Act as "a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply, or distribution of goods or the provision of a service". This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law. Section 4 mirrors Article 81 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.The Competition Authority, the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law, found in 2004 that self-employed persons are "undertakings" for the purposes of the 2002 Act, and as such collectively bargained agreements concluded by representative bodies on behalf of such persons are prohibited agreements under section 4.The Competition Act does not prohibit negotiations between an employer and a representative organisation when such a body is representing employees.As the Deputy is aware, a review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002 is currently underway and in the course of that review, the issues raised in the Deputy's question and legal advice obtained from the Office of the Attorney General are being examined.

The Schemes will, subject to the offer document, be based on the Public Service Model Employee Scheme and standard provisions for public service Spouses' and Children's schemes.The arrangements are obligatory for all employees appointed to the County and City Enterprise Boards on or after 2 April 2008.

These arrangements do not apply to staff on secondment to CEBs.I am satisfied that the new arrangements offer all employees appropriate pension entitlements.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 55, 118 and 126 together.The retail price of all carbon fuels, including diesel, has increased significantly in recent months. This essentially reflects the considerable increase in the global wholesale price of oil.As the Deputies are aware the Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  There is free entry into the market, and prices at the pump for both petrol and diesel reflect market factors notably global market price, transportation costs, Euro/Dollar fluctuations and other operating costs.In so far as the relativity between the price of diesel and petrol is concerned, traditionally, diesel has been less expensive than petrol at the forecourts in Ireland.  This was due to the fact that the international prices for both products were previously at a similar level, and excise duty was and is lower on diesel.  European production was also closely matched to demand for both products. The international price of diesel has however increased relative to petrol for a number of reasons, including:Demand for diesel is rising both within Europe and in China and other rapidly-developing economies world-wide.  According to the March and April International Energy Agency (IEA) Oil Market Reports, Europe has been experiencing lower imports of distillates from the US and elsewhere as cargoes have been diverted to Latin America, South Africa and the Middle East.The increased demand for aviation fuel (which comes from the same part of the barrel as diesel) is also a contributory factor.European refineries are unable to keep pace with the demand for diesel. Each barrel of oil can only produce a certain percentage of diesel, and European diesel demand now exceeds production.  This means that diesel has to be sourced from further afield, particularly from Russia, thus affecting price.Government policy in relation to prices, including the price of commodities such as petrol and diesel, is concentrated on the promotion of competition, consumer choice and awareness.  There is no price control on these products and in common with most other goods and services price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy.  It is a matter for retailers to explain price differences where they occur.The Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order, 1997 requires petrol stations to display their prices in a clear and prominent manner so that consumers can make an informed choice.  The Order enables consumers to readily compare prices and purchase their fuel on the basis of an informed choice. The National Consumer Agency enforces this Order.In so far as the Competition Authority is concerned, the Authority is the body with responsibility for ensuring that traders do not engage in anti-competitive practices.I note that Deputies have suggested that investigations should be carried out in relation to the global increase in fuel prices, by bodies such as the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency. I am not clear as to the nature of any specific investigation that either the Agency or the Authority could usefully carry out in this area given that wholesale prices have risen mainly due to international factors caused by a combination of strong demand, tight capacities and some market speculation. Should the Deputies have any evidence of traders selling fuel products engaging in anti competitive practices, they should bring this evidence to the attention of the Authority who will take the necessary action as it has done in the past.The upward global trend in oil prices reinforces the imperative for Ireland to reduce its oil dependency and to use energy wisely and efficiently. The Deputies will be aware of the actions being taken by Government to accelerate delivery of our targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency which are essential to ensure a sustainable energy future for the economy and consumers.In so far as the transport and haulage industries are concerned, I understand that my colleague Minister Noel Dempsey, as Minister with primary responsibility in this area, will shortly meet with the Irish Road Haulage Association to discuss rising fuel prices, particularly diesel prices, and their effects on their members.It is clear, therefore, that rising fuel prices present a significant challenge for consumers, businesses and indeed for the whole of our society. It is important that as a society we all face and play our part in meeting this challenge. I would wish to assure the House that the Government, through the pursuit of prudent policies and in conjunction with the work of dedicated agencies such as the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, will play its part in seeking to ensure that the interests of all sectors of our society and of the economy as a whole will not be impacted unduly by the ongoing effects of rising fuel prices.

Balanced regional development and a thriving culture of entrepreneurship in all parts of Ireland are key strategic objectives for my Department and the Development agencies under its remit.Enterprise Ireland's current strategy, "Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010", focuses on facilitating entrepreneurship and the enterprise environment in local and rural communities, driving the creation of innovation based start-ups, actively engaging in the Community Enterprise Scheme and proactively developing existing clients in all regions including Cork south west. Enterprise Ireland works with just over 700 client companies in County Cork, which employ a total of 18,065 people. In 2008, the agency will continue to deliver its wide range of programmes to address the demands of entrepreneurship and the diversity of business types.West Cork County Enterprise Board (CEB) provides a source of support throughout south west Cork for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer.  The Board's function is to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity.  During 2007, West Cork CEB paid out €120,347 in grant assistance to 15 projects and over 700 people participated in management and capability development training courses organised by the Board.  West Cork CEB's 2008 overall budget allocation is in excess of €900,000.  This targeted exchequer funding will continue to enable the Board to maximise regional entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the region.IDA Ireland is also supporting enterprise development in the region through its ongoing strategy of growing and embedding foreign direct investment activity. The agency is encouraging its client companies to add strategic functions to their Irish operations in areas such asR&D and marketing. There are opportunities here for indigenous companies in the areas of sub-supply and service provision.I am satisfied that the efforts being made by Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the West Cork County Enterprise Board, together with local interests, will continue to bring investment and job opportunities to Cork south west.

Two of these Directives are overdue. The first of these, Directive 2007/13EC on measuring instruments, is expected to be transposed by 30 June. It is intended to transpose the second overdue Directive, Directive 2006/121/EC on dangerous substances, by 31 July.Full details of all current and recent EU Directives are maintained on the Departmental website, www.entemp.ie.My Department has received 24 Reasoned Opinions from the European Commission relating to Directives since 2002. The outstanding issues concerning all but one of these Directives have been resolved satisfactorily.On 23 October 2007, twelve Member States, including Ireland, received a Reasoned Opinion concerning the implementation of Council Directive 96/82/EC on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances as amended by Directive 2003/105/EC (known as the Seveso Directive). Since then considerable progress has been achieved and reported to the EU Commission.  Measures are being taken to ensure full compliance as soon as possible.

It was found that the level of redundancy had almost doubled and the cause may be attributed to two factors:Firstly, there were more people at work in the more recent period; this accounted for 20% of the increase in the level of redundancies.Secondly, the risk of redundancy increased significantly in the second period and this accounted for 80% of the increase in the level of redundancy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	638	The Consumer Protection (Fixed Payment Notice) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 689 of 2007) came into effect on 13 October 2007.  Responsibility for enforcement of these Regulations is a matter for the National Consumer Agency and I have no direct function in the matter.I am informed that to date payments have been paid in fourteen cases in response to fixed payment notices served by Authorised Officers of the National Consumer Agency.  In a further two cases in which individuals served with fixed payment notices have chosen not to make payments, the National Consumer Agency has initiated, or is initiating, court proceedings in respect of the alleged offences.All of the fixed payment notices in respect of which payments have been made, or court proceedings are pending, involve alleged offences under the European Communities (Requirement to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 639 of 2002).I wish to clarify for the record that, based on information supplied by the National Consumer Agency, a response to a previous Parliamentary Question of 30 April 2008 on this subject stated that one fixed payment notice was issued for an alleged breach of the Retail Prices (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order 1999 (S.I. No. 263 of 1999).  The position has now been clarified and is as outlined above.

Strong, balanced regional development and a thriving culture of entrepreneurship in all parts of Ireland are key strategic objectives for my Department and the development agencies under its remit.Enterprise Ireland operates according to three-year strategies. They have either met or exceeded the targets set by the agency for the 2005-2007 period. Enterprise Ireland's new strategy, ‘Transforming Irish Industry 2008-2010', focuses on facilitating entrepreneurship and the enterprise environment in local and rural communities; driving the creation of innovation based start-ups, actively engaging in the Community Enterprise Scheme and proactively developing existing clients in all regions.Enterprise Ireland works with almost 490 client companies in the West Region, which employ 11,693 people. In 2007, €14.8m was approved by EI for clients in the West Region.In the Midlands, EI works with over 300 client companies which employ over 9,900 people. In 2007 approvals for Midlands clients was over €7.5m.In 2008, Enterprise Ireland will continue to deliver its wide range of programmes to address the demands of entrepreneurship and the diversity of business types.The role of the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) in the Midland and Western Region is to provide a source of support for micro-enterprise in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level. The specific types of formal CEB assistance available to micro-enterprise is broken down between financial assistance such as grants for feasibility studies, employment grants and capital grants and non-financial assistance ("soft supports") such as programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education and Women in Business networks.During 2007, the Midland Region CEBs, composed of Longford, Westmeath, Laois and Offaly paid out over €1.48m in grant assistance to 109 clients. This intervention has assisted in the creation of 236 jobs in the region. The CEBs in the Western Region, comprising of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon have paid out over €1.11m in grant assistance to 104 clients, which in turn, has enabled the creation of 328 jobs in the area.During 2008 the CEBs in the Midlands and Western Region will continue to support enterprise development through the provision of both direct financial assistance (in the form of capital, feasibility and employment grants) and through indirect or soft support assistance such as management development capability support and the development and delivery of activities to highlight and promote enterprise.IDA Ireland is also supporting enterprise development in the region through its ongoing strategy of growing and embedding foreign direct investment activity. The agency is encouraging its client companies to add strategic functions to its Irish operations in areas such as R&R and marketing. There are opportunities here for indigenous companies in the areas of sub-supply and service provision.

Fifty- six inspectors have been assigned to NERA from these competitions.All fifty-six inspectors have completed NERA Inspection Services Introductory Training Programme and are currently undertaking further training, including on-the-job training with experienced inspectors. This involves working with experienced Inspectors in carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with certain employment rights legislation.Assignment of the three remaining Inspectors selected in the competitions is ongoing and it is intended that these Inspectors will commence training immediately upon arrival.Seven of the original 31 Inspectors have left NERA either on promotion or as a result of internal and external Departmental transfers.  As a result, the total number of NERA Inspectors currently stands at eighty.As the panels established in 2007 to recruit the additional Inspectors have now been exhausted a further recruitment process is being organised to fill the existing posts and other vacancies as they arise.

Both myself and the Chief Executive of Enterprise Ireland met with the company prior to the announcement.  Since the announcement, I have met with Union Representatives and I have been in correspondence with the company in Dublin.In my press release of 9 May, 2008, I welcomed the company's major investment plans to secure the future of brewing in Ireland.  I also said that it was very important that the impact on employment was minimised, and that my Department would work closely with the company to secure the best possible outcome.  This is still the position.

The Health and Safety Authority, which shares my concerns, continues to work with this sector to reduce accident rates and improve the health and safety of all those involved.The number of workers who have died in the transport and storage sector in accidents involving vehicles in and around workplaces was — 2005 — 5; 2006 — 4; 2007 — 8; 2008 to date — 3.  In addition, approximately 1,000 work-related non-fatal injuries are reported to the Authority each year from the transport and storage sector.The most common workplace transport accidents involve people being hit by vehicles, people falling from vehicles, objects falling from vehicles and vehicles toppling over.The Health and Safety Authority works closely with other bodies which have responsibilities in relation to transport safety.  These include the Road Safety Authority and An Garda Síochána.As part of its high priority work programme activities for 2008, the Health and Safety Authority aims to influence a sustained reduction in fatal and major accidents related to workplace transport safety through a programme of information provision, awareness raising and targeted enforcement.As part of the focus on workplace transport safety, the Health and Safety Authority has commissioned research to establish a baseline for compliance with safety provisions in Ireland and to examine the practices and attitudes of employers and employees relating to workplace transport safety.  Results of the research will be used to shape the Authority's approach for the coming years.This Autumn, the Health and Safety Authority will be launching a Workplace Transport Safety Campaign, to raise awareness of the importance of managing the risk in this high risk area. The high priority programme will see the Health and Safety Authority's inspectors carrying out 500 targeted inspections, which will focus on workplace transport safety management practices.

The overseas investor is now seeking locations for more advanced manufacturing or office based solutions, to a great extent depending on high skill and high value work.  While this has required a significant change of strategy by the IDA, progress has been made in securing new high value investments from Pacificare, Pramerica, SITA and Abbott Diabetes, with some 1,200 new jobs being added in the County by overseas firms over the last five years.  These companies continue to recruit and are actively seeking new staff.As regards Enterprise Ireland, which serves the indigenous sector, it provides a wide range of supports for high potential start up companies including financial supports, business and marketing advice, mentoring, product development etc.  As part of its infrastructural support for start-up companies, Enterprise Ireland has approved some €3.5 million in recent years for developments at Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which is an important aspect of supporting and attracting business to the region.Enterprise Ireland's results for jobs created in client companies in County Donegal for 2007 show a net gain for the third year in a row with a net increase of over 440 jobs.  A growth of 15% over the last three years reflects the investment Donegal companies are making in competing successfully both at home and abroad.  During the 3 year period to December 2007, Enterprise Ireland approved over €14m to companies in County Donegal to support the development of new sales, exports and jobs.Enterprise Ireland has also been very active in supporting the development of community enterprise centres in the North West Region, which are critical to continued enterprise development in rural areas and to the development of an entrepreneurial culture.  Nine Community Enterprise Centres in County Donegal have received funding of approximately €2 million under the Community Enterprise Centre Scheme to date.The role of the Donegal County Enterprise Board, is to provide support to micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  Through the provision of both financial and non-financial support, the Board supports individuals, firms and community groups, provided that the proposed projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability.  Financial support is available in the form of Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study grants.  In relation to non-financial support, Donegal CEB engages in a range of activities to stimulate enterprise and to support small businesses.Despite past difficulties in County Donegal, due to the challenges faced by traditional industries such as agriculture, fishing and textiles, there is clear evidence that the county is successfully engaged in a transition to the new economy.  Most recently, with the support of Údarás na Gaeltachta, Forward Emphasis International is set to expand its workforce by 100 at a new facility in the Gaoth Dobhair Business Park with Euro Iompú Teo also set to expand its workforce by 100 in Gaoth Dobhair.  A major investment by Randox Laboratories, in Dungloe, will lead to the creation of a further 135 jobs.I can assure the Deputy that funding support and initiatives for enterprises in County Donegal is, and will remain, a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.

The various Price Display Orders made under the Prices Acts 1958 to 1972 cover Drinks Display in Licensed Premises, Hairdressing Services, Petrol and Diesel and Restaurants.  The European Communities (Requirements to Indicate Product Prices) Regulations 2002 require retailers to display the selling and, where appropriate, the unit price (the price per litre or kilo) for all products covered by the scope of the Regulations.  The Commission will be reviewing the Directive upon which these Regulations are based and I will support measures to enhance the information to be made available to consumers.  This review is part of the general review of the Consumer Acquis.The National Consumer Agency whose function it is to enforce consumer laws, regularly undertakes surveillance with a view to securing voluntary compliance on the part of traders.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I am fully aware of the concerns expressed by the Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency in relation to the logistical challenges arising from the Agency's relocation to Cork.  The proposed location of the Agency in Cork is as part of the overall decentralisation programme, which provides that staff of public bodies, such as the National Consumer Agency, transfer to decentralised locations on a voluntary basis.My Department is working very closely with the Agency to devise a staff transition plan with a view to a phased and managed transition of the Agency's staff between now and the relocation of the Agency to Cork in 2009.  The plan is intended to ensure that the location of the Agency to Cork will be successfully achieved without any undue interference with the effectiveness or the ongoing work of the Agency.  I am confident that the close co-operation between my Department and the Agency will help to ensure that the relocation process will be successful.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I would like to express my disappointment at the decision of the company to close its Cork operations and I have asked the State development agencies under the aegis of my Department to make every effort to assist the workers being made redundant in securing alternative employment.Freescale is a large global company that regularly makes adjustments to resources as a normal course of operations to meet changing business requirements in a very dynamic industry.  The company has decided to streamline its cellular design centres and as part of this decision, is proposing that all programmes in its Cork design facility be transferred to other locations and the facility be closed.  The closure of the facility expected in September 2008, will result in 47 employees losing their jobs.IDA Ireland is providing ongoing assistance to local management in Freescale Cork and is using its network of overseas offices to find alternative employment in the Radio Frequency and Wireless technology area, for impacted employees in the company.  FÁS has been in contact with the management of Freescale and will make arrangements to register the employees.  The full range of FÁS services will be made available to the employees as will the services and supports of Enterprise Ireland and the County Enterprise Board for any worker considering establishing her or his own business.There are a variety of differing and complex factors and not just cost related, which might influence a decision to relocate all or part of a firm's functions.  In addition to cost factors, these may include business takeovers, consolidations and changes in product or market focus. The result is flows of investment and employment across borders.Ireland successfully manages this process, through our policies on growing indigenous enterprise and attracting and embedding foreign direct investment.  These policies have enabled us to win many prestigious and value added investments, and have enabled us to replace lost jobs with others of equal or higher value in the economy.The pipeline of new business for which the IDA is competing is as strong as at any time in recent years.  We measure success now in terms of the number, quality and spread of investments, not just in job numbers alone.  I am please to say that Ireland is now a global competitor for Research and Innovation investment from multinational companies and leading research institutions.We are moving ahead on a number of fronts to meet the targets of the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation and the development of a knowledge economy.  I believe we will continue to achieve and sustain our excellence in research from which our economy will reap rewards.  The key to our success will be seeing the outputs of current research in terms of new innovations and discoveries that will directly impact on peoples lives, that is, that they will lead to jobs, improvements in health care, new products and services.We will continue to have an educated and skilled work force which will be the cornerstone of the next phase of our economic development.  We are investing in infrastructure. We are investing in people.  And we are investing in innovation and enterprise.  We are confidently investing for our future.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies will continue to support enterprise development and job creation.  I want to reaffirm that the State agencies will continue to work closely with each other and with local interests, to assist an integrated approach to investment and enterprise development, not just in County Cork, but throughout the State.

This is being achieved through participation in a range of FÁS programmes, including Community Employment (CE), and also integration into mainline training aimed at progression into the active labour market.FÁS aims to promote labour market re-integration through targeted and mainstream initiatives including guidance & support from the referral point which is the FÁS Employment Services/Local Employment Services and pre-CE initiatives to support stabilisation.Currently, there are 1,000 ring fenced places on Community Employment based in approximately 100 rehabilitative schemes.The Programme for Government commitment to implement the recommendations of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation will result in an increase of 300 places Community Employment during the lifetime of the Government.  FÁS Community Employment Places are seen as central to the rehabilitation process.In addition, there are opportunities to access and participate on mainline training programmes in FÁS Training Centres and other FÁS programmes including Local Training Initiative and Community Training Centres.  These opportunities promote progression, where possible, back into the labour market.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	649	Data from the CSO quarterly industrial survey shows that average industrial earnings per hour for male industrial workers on adult rates in June 2007 was €16.62.  For female industrial workers the average rate was €12.73.From the CSO National Employment Survey for March 2006, average hourly earnings were €20.59 for males and €18.22 for females.  These latter figures cover the entire economy in March 2006 (excluding employees in agriculture, forestry and fishing).The gender pay gap has fallen consistently and is now below the EU average of 15%.  The most recent official figures from Eurostat (2006) put the gender pay gap at 9%, placing Ireland fourth lowest among the EU27.  This compares with a rate of 11% in 2004, showing an improvement of 2% in two years.Primary responsibility for policy in relation to the gender pay gap is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Addressing the factors behind the gender pay gap is, however, a multi-faceted task involving a number of Government Departments and agencies as outlined in the National Women's Strategy, 2007-2016.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment undertakes the following actions.I am responsible for the National Minimum Wage legislation.  The national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland in April 2000.  Since its introduction there have been six increases to the minimum rate.  The most recent increase saw the minimum wage increase to €8.65 per hour, which is the second highest in the EU.  The introduction of the national minimum wage in 2000 has had a positive impact on women who previously were more likely to have received very low wages in sectors which were predominantly female.  Prior to the introduction of the minimum wage, the gender pay gap was at 22%.My Department is responsible for chairing and providing the secretariat for the National Framework Committee on Work/life Balance Policies.  This Committee, which was established under the social partnership process, comprises representatives from IBEC, ICTU, the Equality Authority and a number of Government Departments.  The Committee has undertaken and continues to undertake a range of activities to raise awareness and encourage the provision of work/life balance at the level of the enterprise, including the provision of financial assistance to organisations, information dissemination activities, seminars, research etc."Expanding the Workforce", which is run by FÁS, is aimed at proactively encouraging women to return to work.  The initiative facilitates women returnees by ensuring that training is provided in a flexible manner and is tailored to meet business requirements and skills needs of employers.

It is one of the priorities in the Commission's Legislative Work Programme 2008.Following a public consultation process, the Commission has yet to determine the scope and content of any SBA.  It is expected that the Commission will publish proposals under the SBA in early July, probably on 2 July.  Despite the SBA being styled as an Act, it will follow the traditional structure of EU legislation and actions, consisting of general principles to support the development and growth of SMEs and specific legislative proposals such as directives or regulations addressing issues of relevance to SMEs.Ireland's position is that we would be generally supportive of efforts assisting the growth and development of SMEs as intended under the SBA, subject to seeing the detailed proposal from the Commission.  We would wish to see Member States retaining flexibility in dealing with SMEs in the context of their own economic conditions and specific needs with full regard to national sovereignty, the relevant Treaty provisions and principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.  Following publication, the SBA will be negotiated in the relevant EU groups through the normal mechanisms.The SBA will be a priority for the incoming French Presidency.  France intends to hold a first general discussion on the specific proposal by Ministers at the Informal Competitiveness Council in Versailles on 17/18 July 2008.

As the ILO Director General acknowledged, building a global social floor could be done in a step-by-step way according to each country's needs and priorities.The essence of the message in his address reflects the four strategic objectives set in the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalisation which was adopted  at the International Labour Conference earlier this month.  Ireland, along with all other EU Member States fully supported the core objectives enshrined in the recently adopted Declaration which also acknowledges that the mandate of the ILO needs to be strengthened to enable it to better respond to its members needs to tackle changes arising from the globalisation process.  Ireland, alongside its EU counterparts, also fully supported the accompanying Resolution that includes concrete modalities in support of implementation of the Declaration.  The new Declaration is an important tool and promotional framework for the achievement of the ILO's four strategic objectives that comprise the Decent Work Agenda.Ireland's focus in this regard, has been on creating an environment in which employment and decent work is fostered and grows while achieving outcomes that are fair to the wider society at large who are seeking decent standards and fairness.  From a domestic perspective, a key element of our approach has been to ground these developments within social dialogue, which provides the mechanism to achieve the correct balance between labour market flexibility and job and income security.  Additionally, as evidenced by our participation in, and contribution to, internal and external policies pursued by the European Union, including in the context of the Lisbon Agenda on Growth and Employment and the EU international trade negotiations, Ireland is currently part of a global alliance, which actively works towards building a social floor at the global level.

Ireland only ratifies those ILO Conventions which are in conformity with our existing national law and practice.  To that extent, in ratification, the Conventions have the status of international treaties and Ireland is obliged to adhere to the core objectives established in each of the ILO Conventions, which must be reflected in national practice.  Specifically, the enactment of legislation by the Oireachtas across the full range of fundamental labour and social rights comprehends and underpins the realisation of the standards set in these ILO Conventions.  These core objectives are also being realised through the delivery of commitments entered into, for example, in National Partnership Agreements.Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to realise and implement labour standards and will continue to do so.  Ireland's continuing progress in the achievement of these goals is subject to ongoing review and evaluation by the ILO itself, in consultation with the Social Partners.

The figures provided in this reply for the VAT yield in 2008 are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of oil products and gas up to the end of the period in question.  Mineral Oil Tax is paid in the month of clearance of the product but, depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, VAT returns can be made monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid.Mineral Oil Tax200620072008 (Jan to May) Prov€m€m€mPetrol1,026.31,051.3471.5Auto Diesel1,016.71,075.8483.7Marked Gas Oil68.868.431.6Kerosene18.0N/aN/aTotal2,129.82,195.5986.8Estimated VAT Yield200620072008 (Jan to May) Prov€m€m€mPetrol440.0465.0222.3Auto Diesel53.057.028.8Marked Gas Oil73.070.038.5Kerosene79.077.050.4Gas52.759.826.4Total697.7728.8366.4The Government recognises the concerns arising as a result of the increase in fuel prices.  However, the increase in the price of fuels is not tax driven, but is an international phenomenon affecting all countries, and all sectors of the economy and society.  Fuel prices are driven by a number of factors including the price of oil on international markets, exchange rates, production costs and refining costs.  The rise in oil prices over recent periods reflects additional factors such as geopolitical uncertainty, supply disruptions and strong economic growth in countries such as China.I would point out that excise duty rates on fuels in Ireland are relatively low by EU standards.  Excise rates for diesel, petrol and other fuel oils have not been increased in the last four Budgets.  In addition, over recent years the excise duty rates applicable to both kerosene and LPG used for home heating purposes have been reduced to zero.The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase.  On the other hand, the yield from VAT, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  However, in this regard it should be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol, diesel and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.In relation to VAT, I should point out that businesses are of course entitled to reclaim VAT incurred on their business inputs, including VAT incurred on fuel.  For example, VAT incurred on auto-diesel, marked gas oil (MGO or green diesel) kerosene and natural gas used in the course of business is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.Insofar as calls for reduced taxes at an EU level are concerned, given the impact high oil prices can have on growth rates, Ecofin considered the issue of an appropriate policy response to the price increases at its meeting on 3 June 2008.  Ecofin confirmed the agreement reached in Manchester in 2005 that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions should be avoided that prevent the necessary adjustments by economic agents.  Reducing taxes on fuels would send the wrong signal both to consumers and to oil producers.  We must therefore be careful not to exacerbate an already difficult situation.  The high price of fuel illustrates the need for energy efficiency and alternative fuel sources.The Government has taken successive opportunities to make real and significant increases to the payments to pensioners and the socially excluded, and also to reduce the levels of tax paid by lower income earners.  The Deputy will also be aware that the National Fuel Allowance Scheme and the Households Benefits Package provide specific assistance to the less well off in respect of fuel costs.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	657	Article 44 of Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications provides that a five year programme of education and training must be completed in order to qualify and practice as a pharmacist.  The current situation in Ireland is that graduates of the four year pharmacy degree programmes are obliged under national and EU law to undertake and complete one year of practical training, of which a minimum of 6 months must be in the community or hospital sectors in order to comply with Ireland's obligations under the aforementioned Directive.  This period of practical pre-registration training must be supervised by a practising tutor pharmacist.  The one year's pre-registration training must be completed prior to being eligible to apply to sit the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI's) Licence examination held twice annually, in May and in November (i.e. the earliest that this year's pharmacy graduates may be eligible to sit the Examination will be November 2009).Statutory responsibility for overseeing pharmacy education and training rests with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI).  In late Autumn every year, the PSI writes to the total number of qualified tutor pharmacists held on its database (currently in excess of 1,000) to identify those who are in a position to provide a training placement for pharmacy graduates within their pharmacy for the following training year (i.e. the training year due to commence the following Autumn).  In recent years there have been around 200 placements available annually, mostly in the community sector, but with upward of 30 in the hospital sector.  The allocation of posts, and their funding, in the public hospital sector is a function of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The details of the these placements are circulated to the fourth year pharmacy students by the PSI at the end of November via the schools of pharmacy.The number of available training placements notified to the PSI in Autumn 2006 for the 2007-08 training year was 202.  All 144 pharmacy graduates qualified to take up placements, found training places in 2007-08.In response to the PSI's call for tutors for 2008/09, a total of 209 positive replies were notified to the PSI and circulated to the fourth year pharmacy students in late November 2007.  Notwithstanding the above, certain difficulties were being experienced by pharmacy graduates this year in securing pre-registration training placements in the community pharmacy sector, primarily due to the withdrawal of such places by a number of tutors/pharmacies.  However, I understand that the position has improved and the PSI continues to monitor the situation in consultation with the third level schools of pharmacy.  A very small number of the placements in the hospital sector are also at issue, which my Department has raised with the HSE.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	658	The Food Supplements Directive, 2002/46/EC, has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 506 of 2007.  That legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This ensures that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.One of the objectives of the Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC) was to make provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.  The European Commission published a Discussion Paper on determining maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in June 2006.The Irish response to this paper, issued in November 2006, gave Ireland's view that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people and those on various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the position on this issue.Discussions are ongoing at European level on the development of a methodology under which maximum safe levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set.  Those discussions will permit the European Commission and Member States to further develop future direction on this issue.  It is this Department's view that the setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals should not, in itself, cause major cost or hardship for consumers.

A comprehensive public consultation process has been completed, together with meetings with key stakeholders, including in particular the Health Service Executive and An Garda Síochána, and it is expected that the outcome of the review will be published this summer.  The review addresses the issue of compliance by Government agencies and others with the Children First guidelines.As part of the review, the Children First guidelines will be reprinted.  The substance and principles of the guidelines will remain unchanged and will facilitate the continuation of a seamless child protection service.  However, minor amendments will be made to reflect the following:Changes in structures and legislation since the guidelines were first printed in 1999;Issues arising from the publication of the ‘Review Inquiry on any Matter pertaining to Child Protection Issues touching on or concerning Dr. A' report in April 2008;Minor changes in relation to internal HSE procedures and terminology.In relation to this area a Senior Officials group, comprising staff of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, An Garda Síochána, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Education and Science was recently established and is conducting regular meetings.  The key role of this group is to see that all the appropriate measures are in place to ensure there is full awareness of child protection policies, guidelines and procedures as required under the Children First guidelines, and to advise me accordingly.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	670	A letter has been received in my Department from the individual referred to by the Deputy.  My officials are in discussion with relevant parties regarding the specific points made on survival rates and I will respond in detail to these shortly, when I have the necessary information.There has been very strong support for the concept of a specialist centre where a woman can be guaranteed that her initial diagnosis and treatment will be managed by a multidisciplinary team, which should predict complications and be familiar with all relevant investigations and treatment for the disease.  Women attending the centres will know that they are in the hands of highly-skilled consultants and nurses who have access to all the resources necessary to achieve the best results possible in terms of survival rates.Based on the National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services, and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will significantly reduce the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has designated eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.  The National Cancer Control Programme has identified University College Hospital Galway (UCHG) as one of the designated specialist cancer centres for the Western region.  The Programme therefore will consolidate symptomatic breast cancer services in UCHG.  This involves a transfer of the Sligo symptomatic breast service to UCHG.In order to comply with the Standards, the HSE has directed seventeen hospitals to cease breast cancer services.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services, including Sligo General Hospital, will occur over the next eighteen months in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres.The designation of cancer centres aims to ensure that patients receive the highest quality care while at the same time allowing local access to services, where appropriate.  Where diagnosis and treatment planning is directed and managed by multi-disciplinary teams based at the cancer centres, then much of the treatment (other than surgery) can be delivered in local hospitals, such as Sligo General Hospital.  In this context, chemotherapy and support services will continue to be delivered locally.I have full confidence in the service that BreastCheck provides.  The National Breast Screening Programme provides a high quality screening service and the aim of the Programme is to reduce mortality in women between 50 — 64 years by at least 20 per cent over a decade.The BreastCheck Programme is subject to ongoing audit and review on an annual basis and performance is evaluated against internationally accepted parameters.  This information is published in a transparent manner and is available in the BreastCheck Annual reports.  BreastCheck has consistently reached and indeed surpassed these international standards which are interim measures of how successful the programme is likely to be at reducing mortality due to breast cancer.  Contrary to the statement in the letter that the roll-out of BreastCheck will have no impact on survival, the National Cancer Screening Service BreastCheck is confident that BreastCheck is on track to make a significant impact on national breast cancer survival figures.BreastCheck commissioned the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) to conduct an independent external audit of the BreastCheck service.  This audit was carried out in early 2005 and found that BreastCheck was reaching all critical standards.

The Company was accordingly advised that should it wish to pursue the introduction of the proposed service changes, it must apply for Ministerial consent under Section 25 of the 1958 Act.   Alternatively, the Company was advised that it could review its proposal in order to avoid competition with the licensed operator.On 5th June 2008 Dublin Bus submitted a revised proposal for the rerouting of its 41x morning peak services from Swords. My Department considered the proposal and was satisfied that the changes proposed would not compete with an existing licensed service and therefore, did not require Ministerial consent in accordance with section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958.  Accordingly, Dublin Bus was advised on the 12th June, 2008 that it may proceed with the proposed changes.The position regarding funding paid to Dublin Bus in respect of their Public Service Obligation (PSO) services is as follows:The funding is paid (through CIÉ):(a) in their capacity as State-owned transport operator with a statutory mandate to provide PSO services; and(b) solely for PSO services.The compensation paid to CIÉ (in respect of PSO services provided by Dublin Bus), in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation 1191/69, does not exceed the difference between the costs incurred for discharging these PSOs and the revenue generated through the sale of bus tickets. CIÉ, in its annual accounts, confirms compliance with all relevant EU Regulations governing State aid to transport undertakings.

This is the principle reason for providing bus lanes and other measures to promote bus priority on our roads.I am aware that quite a number of cities around the world have introduced High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.  The results have varied greatly. While the planning, design and provision of bus lanes is a matter for local authorities as part of their general traffic management remit, I have no current plans to promote such lanes in Ireland.  It is a matter for local consideration.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	687	The situation in the ethnic Somali Ogaden region of Ethiopia has deteriorated sharply in the last six months. The conflict between the Government and the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) is causing serious hardship for the mainly pastoralist and nomadic people of the region, whose livelihoods have been disrupted. Some NGOs have complained of serious restrictions on humanitarian access to this drought-affected region.While the Government of Ethiopia has an overriding responsibility, as well as a moral obligation, to restore order in this troubled region, it should do all it can to minimise the impact of the conflict on ordinary people, and to ensure full respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. On several occasions, Irish officials have conveyed to the Ethiopian side Ireland's very deep concern about the reports we have received in relation to the Ogaden region. We will continue to highlight these concerns until the situation is resolved. Ireland has also taken the lead in pressing for the EU to engage with Ethiopia in relation to this situation, given the EU's importance as a partner for Ethiopia, and our shared commitment to the well-being and development of the Ethiopian people.As regards Ireland's assistance to Ethiopia, I believe that Irish Aid funding makes a real and tangible difference to the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable people there. Where assistance is channelled through sectoral ministries and regional authorities, it is ring-fenced for spending on basic needs programmes such as the building of schools, the training of health workers and teacher training. These programmes have a direct and positive effect on the lives of thousands of poor Ethiopians, and are helping to build a basis for real and lasting change in their lives. The programmes are also carefully monitored by our Embassy staff on the ground, and are externally evaluated from time to time. For all these reasons, despite my concerns with regard to the situation in Ethiopia, I believe it is right to remain engaged there.

The resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties to the dispute.  In the case of the company referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the principal method of regulating industrial relations is collective bargaining i.e. the company engages in direct negotiation with the representatives of the employees.For cases where the parties have failed to find a solution to the issues in dispute, the State provides the dispute settling machinery of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Issues relating to cases that have been referred to the dispute settling machinery for resolution are operational matters for the State's dispute settling agencies and I have no function in these matters.

No accounts are required to be attached to a company's first annual return.Subsequent annual return dates for the company will fall on the anniversary of that first annual return date, unless the company alters its annual return date.  A company may, if it wishes, make any subsequent annual return up to a date that is earlier than its statutory annual return date — the requirement under the legislation is that a company make the return up to a date "that is not later than its annual return date". If a company wishes to alter its annual return date for future years to the earlier date to which it has made up its current year's return, it may do so. Alternatively, if the company wishes to retain its original annual return date in respect of future years, notwithstanding the earlier filing of the current year's annual return, it may do so by notifying CRO of this on the annual return form.  Accordingly, companies, on the completion of their accounts may, if they wish, submit those accounts to the Companies Registration Office with their annual return, notwithstanding the fact that the company's NARD may be at some remove.This has been the position since 17 May 2004, when section 127 of the Companies Act 1963 (inserted by section 60 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001) was amended by section 46 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 and is subject to the requirement of section 125 of the Companies Act 1963 that every company shall make a return at least once in every calendar year.

We have no control over issues such as rising oil prices and the decline in the value of the dollar against the euro.  However, it is important to ensure that our domestic cost base does not undermine competitiveness. The Government is actively seeking to restrain inflationary pressures, promote competition, pursuit of sensible incomes policy, and we are keeping public spending growth at sustainable levels. Doing this will allow us to keep the burden of taxation low, thus helping to maintain competitiveness and to maximise our economic potential. These are all part of our strategy to improve the cost environment and to enhance competitiveness.In relation to public expenditure, we are committed to moderate the growth in current spending in line with the growth in available resources, notwithstanding our key priority to fully implementing the National Development Plan.  This will improve competitiveness through eliminating infrastructural bottlenecks and by raising the skills set of the population.  This Government has always been focussed on addressing competitiveness issues as they emerge. Through our enterprise policies we are committed to making the economy one of the best locations in which to build businesses in high technology and internationally traded services. The Government has introduced a number of non-inflationary budgets in recent years and responds to the regular advice on the competitiveness agenda provided by the National Competitiveness Council. In addition, the recent Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing outlines both global and domestic trends driving change in the sector and the implications for manufacturing companies operating in Ireland.  The Group acknowledged the relevant policies that have been put in place and the substantial number of supports available to the manufacturing sector.  Ireland's existing expertise provides a base for continued wealth creation over the next decade and the Group envisage that Ireland's manufacturing base will continue to move up the value chain.  The Group's recommendations seek to substantially enhance existing manufacturing by delivering the environment and skill set necessary for sustainable success in the contemporary competitive environment.  The Group has outlined a vision for manufacturing based on innovation (both technological and non-technological) and advanced manufacturing.There are undoubtedly challenges to be addressed.  I am satisfied that through our prudent management of the economy, through our social partnership structure, and through the provision of competition and other structural reforms in the economy that we will be able to meet those challenges.

Foodstuffs, food brands, VAT rates and excise duties can differ significantly between member states and this makes the process of comparing prices across countries a complex and costly exercise.A study undertaken for the Consumer Strategy Group in 2004 compared the price of 20 internationally branded products and 20 locally branded products in Ireland with the average price in the euro zone.  It found that, when differences in VAT were taken into account, the internationally branded products were 22 per cent more expensive in Ireland than the eurozone average while the locally branded products were 3.2 per cent more expensive. Comparative surveys of consumer prices in Ireland and the eurozone were also undertaken by Forfás in 2002 and 2003.The National Consumer Agency has recently published the results of a survey comparing the price of a range of branded and own brand goods in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The survey covered food and non-food items.  It found that, after adjustments for exchange rates, VAT and excise duties, the branded goods were 28 to 31 per cent more expensive in the Republic while the own brand goods were 11 to 17 per cent more expensive.

Firms adjust their plant location and utilisation strategies to address matters such as accessing new markets, moving production nearer to customers, meeting firm or market specific customer relationship issues, accessing technology or other competitive considerations. We are equipped to manage this process successfully and enterprise policies have enabled the economy to replace lost jobs with others that are of the same or higher skill level.My Department and Enterprise Agencies do not audit the extent to which job losses in the economy arise due to firms relocating abroad.  We do have information, however, from client companies which have closed plants or downsized their workforces suggesting that job losses have been attributable to a range of factors including loss of contracts or a drop in demand for products, restructuring and rationalisation within companies and relocation of operations abroad.  The last mentioned of these factors, according to the feedback from these companies, has been a relatively minor factor.The relocation of businesses within particular types of industry is a reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.  IDA Ireland places significant focus on embedding existing multinational enterprises in Ireland, by encouraging such enterprises to increase the scale of Irish subsidiaries, and to also expand the range of activities undertaken in Irish subsidiaries to include less mobile types of operations for example R&D activities and Supply Chain Management.   This process of embedding subsidiaries of multinational enterprises makes relocation less likely.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-19 00:00:00	Prelude	701	Disability allowance is a means-tested weekly payment for people who are substantially restricted in taking up employment owing to an illness or disability that is expected to last for at least one year. However, where a person takes up employment that is considered to be rehabilitative in nature earnings from that employment may, be subject to a disregard that will exempt it from assessment as means.No restrictions are placed on the number of hours that can be worked under the disregard and instead it operates so as to encourage the maximising of overall income that can be derived from the combination of disability allowance and earned employment.As of June 1, 2006, the income disregard operates on the basis of a tapered withdrawal rate between €120 and €350. This means that all income up to €120 is disregarded as means when assessing entitlement, while income between €120 and €350 is assessed at a rate of 50 per cent. The effect of this tapered withdrawal rate is that a single person can earn up to €432.50 per week before their disability allowance fully ceases.A review published by the Department of Social and Family Affairs in 2004 of the Illness and Disability Payment Schemes suggested that continually increasing the income disregard level is not the most appropriate answer to the disincentive problem. Instead, that review favoured introducing a mechanism which would allow for the gradual reduction of social welfare benefits as earnings increase, thereby allowing people who increase their earnings or employment potential to see an increase in the overall income level. This approach benefits those in employment, irrespective or the hours worked or hourly rate earned. Thus far, the change in the rules for assessing earnings from employment has resulted in a 40 per cent increase in the number of people availing of the earnings disregard and increasing their overall income level.

Since 2000 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €81.26 per pupil to its current rate of €178.58. This represents an increase of almost 120% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.  The cumulative increase in inflation between 2000 and the end of 2007 is about 30%. The individual annual increases in the grant and the inflation for each year are set out in the table.I would like to assure the Deputy that it is a key priority for the Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools. For that reason specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions in the Programme for Government. These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.In 2008 alone my Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs. The improvements announced in the last budget mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil. As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools. The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.This year, despite the overall difficult economic environment my Department delivered an increase of €15 per pupil on capitation levels in 2008. I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this and deliver on our Programme for Government commitment.YearCapitation grantAnnual increase in grantRate increase as a  % of grantAnnual rate of inflation (Consumer Price Index)€€%%200081.265.086.25.6200195.8714.6115.24.92002105.009.138.74.62003111.586.585.93.52004121.5810.008.22.22005133.5812.009.02.52006145.5812.008.24.02007163.5818.0011.04.92008178.5815.008.4Annual figure for 2008 not yet availableThe total increase since 2000 amounts to €97.32 which represents an increase of almost 120%.

For example, the reading ability of Irish 15 year-olds was far better than the international average. 91% of Irish  25-34 year-olds had completed at least upper second level education or an equivalent course such as a FÁS qualification — compared with an OECD average of 82%.   The proportion of the population aged 25-34 with higher education in Ireland at 41% was well above the OECD average of32%. Ireland was in the top three (with Spain and Finland) most socially equitable countries in terms of educational outcomes and access to higher education. The number of science graduates per 100,000 of employed 25-34 year olds in Ireland was the second highest in the OECD. Third level drop-out rates in Ireland were also significantly below the international average.In relation to investment, the OECD Report notes that between 1995 and 2004, in real terms (allowing for inflation), total public and private spending has increased here by 74% at primary,  second and further education levels and also by 74% at higher education. At first and second levels, this scale of increase was the second highest of any OECD country while at third level it was 6th highest. So, total spending grew faster in Ireland, in absolute terms, than in most other OECD countries.   A comparison of trends in public expenditure only, shows that Ireland recorded a very strong pattern of growth in the decade up to 2004 —  with a doubling in real terms of total public expenditure on education. This placed Ireland second only to Greece among OECD countries in the scale of increase.As also noted in the OECD Report is the fact that "In Ireland, the strong growth of GDP hides a significant increase in spending on educational institutions when spending on education is considered as a proportion of GDP".   Hence, in relation to national income a rapid increase in spending on education — as in other areas of public service — has not kept pace in some years with the extremely rapid increase in national income.I am pleased to say however, that investment in education has also increased very significantly since 2004.  Overall investment in education which has increased significantly in recent years — up by more than 70% since 2002 to over €9.3 billion this year.  This represents a significant increase of over €690 million, or 8%, on the funding position after Budget 2007 and will enable my Department to deliver significantly on a number of fronts:Investing almost €600 million in school buildings;Bringing expenditure on special education to twice the 2004 amount;Putting additional teachers and special needs assistants in place in primary and post-primary schools;  andProviding €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions.The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to implement a comprehensive Schools' ICT Strategy, supported by a dedicated capital investment programme and addressing schools' needs for technical support and maintenance. It will also cover the training needs of teachers.   The Programme for Government also set out that second level students will be given the opportunity to acquire an ECDL qualification in computers by the time they leave school.The NDP provides €252m for the new Schools' ICT strategy to develop an e-Learning culture in schools that will ensure that ICT usage is embedded in teaching and learning across the curriculum.  The new strategy will address teacher professional development, the maintenance of a national broadband network for schools, the upgrading and renewal of hardware along with the provision of software and digital content for learning.  The planned investment will also address maintenance and support requirements.Turning to class size, the Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.   The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing class sizes.The Programme also sets out how improvements in class size in primary schools will be brought about by changes to the staffing schedule that is used to allocate classroom teachers to primary schools based on the total enrolment in the school.  The schedule allocates teachers within enrolment bands and the current bands are based on an average of 27 pupils. The Programme for Government sets a revised basis for the 2010/11 school year of an allocation based on an average of 24 pupils to a class and that this will be achieved on a gradual basis by a series of annual reductions each of 1 point on the schedule.   The latest figures available on average primary class sizes relate to the 2006/07 school year. At that time, the average class size was 24. And the pupil teacher ratio — which includes resource teachers etc.- was 16.4:1 compared to 22.2 in the 1996/97 school year.    For the current school year, extra teachers were provided to staff schools on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.In addition to the supports provided in the classroom, additional resources, including teaching resources, are also provided to cater for the needs of pupils with special educational needs.  Since 2004 investment in special education has doubled to €900 million this year and huge progress has been made:Almost 6,000 additional teachers and SNAs have been put in place mostly at primary level — bringing the total number of special education staff to about 19,000;The level of training available to teachers has improved significantly;All schools have been assigned learning support resource teaching hours based on their enrolment figures;The application process for extra supports has been transformed for the better with the establishment of the NCSE and its team of more than 80 local Special Educational Needs Organisers;A significant expansion in the number of NEPS psychologists is also underway, with a view to all schools receiving a direct service in the 2009/2010 school year; andThere has been a particular focus in recent years on improving services for children with autism. In the past year alone, about 100 extra special classes for autistic children have been set up, bringing the total number to almost 280.Another area that has seen significant targeted investment in recent years is that of additional supports for children and young people from disadvantaged communities and specifically to address matters of class size in primary schools serving disadvantaged communities.In 2008, some €800 million is being provided for such initiatives at all levels of the education system — an increase of 75% on the comparable figure for 2003.  Under the DEIS action plan, primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities are being targeted to benefit from a wide range of extra resources from smaller classes, to school meals, intensive literacy and numeracy programmes and additional day-to-day funding. They are also in receipt of Home School Community Liaison and School Completion services.The DEIS action plan is being rolled out on a phased basis over the period to 2010.  In respect of the 2007/08 school year, grants amounting to approximately €10 million issued to the 670 Primary schools which are participating in the DEIS Initiative. Almost €5 million was paid in the course of the year in respect of the 203 Post Primary schools participating in the initiative and 80 Post Primary Schools receiving grants under pre-existing schemes. In addition, approximately another 1,900 primary schools received almost €4 million of grant assistance to assist them with their respective levels of dispersed disadvantage.  2006 saw the implementation of targeted class size reductions of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes in urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.   In the 2006/2007 school year access to teacher/coordinator support for any of the rural primary schools, not already in receipt of such support under a previous measure, was implemented.  Under DEIS, Home/School/Community liaison and School Completion Programme services have been extended to any of the urban/town primary schools and second-level schools not alreadybenefiting from them.Additional supports outside of the classroom are also provided to meet the needs of children whose first language is not English.  This is met through a programme of language support provided by additional teachers at primary and second level who help children to improve their English language skills.  The commitment to provide 1,800 Language Support Teachers in primary and post-primary schools, outlined in the Programme for Government has already been exceeded with the allocation of almost 2,000 language support teachers in the current school year. The corresponding figures for the 2006/07 and 2005/06 school years are approximately over 1,400 and over 800 respectively.There is a Government commitment to doubling the primary capitation grant by 2012 and to significantly increasing the value of the ancillary services grant that is used by schools for the employment of support staff such as caretakers and secretaries.   These commitments are a direct follow-on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular. In 2007, the primary capitation grant was €163.58.  This was increased by  €15 in 2008 to €178.58 per pupil.On the basis of information available to the Department and taking account of the Area Development Plans produced by the Commission on School Accommodation, it is estimated that about 9,000 additional primary school places are needed in the short term, most of them in the greater Dublin area.   To deal with this increasing demand for school places, the Government is providing funding of €4.5 billion over the lifetime of the new National Development Plan (NDP). This will be the largest investment programme in schools in the history of the State and it will enable the Department to ensure that school places are available where needed.  It will also allow the Department to continue the school building modernisation programme which commenced during the life time of the last NDP when well over €2.6 billion was invested in school development, delivering over 7,800 projects.€586 million has been allocated for school buildings in 2008 which includes €95 million extra for primary schools. The Pre-Budget Outlook published by the Department of Finance in November provided €295 million for primary school buildings in 2008. This was further increased by more than 30% in the Budget to €390 million.   This investment  almost €600 million in  2008 will enable the completion of work on 67 large-scale primary schools projects that will deliver 7,000 additional permanent school places in new schools and 2,300 additional permanent school places in existing schools.  Construction work for over 150 devolved projects under the Permanent Accommodation Scheme which will provide 8,000 additional places in existing primary schools.Under the current National Development Plan, a total of €1.135 billion has been identified for PPP Projects within the Education sector.A Schools programme of 27 primary and post primary schools was announced in September 2005 and these projects are now moving through the system with the 1st Bundle of 4 post primary schools likely to commence construction later this year.  The 2nd Bundle of 6 schools was advertised in the European Journal in May and the Minister will be announcing the 3rd Bundle of school projects later this year.On the Third Level programme 17 projects in 9 institutions were announced in November 2005 and the first bundle of these will be offered to the market this year.  The Department will continue to use the PPP model as appropriate in order to supplement the programme of school construction under the traditional route in relation to funding at second-level, over €1 billion is allocated in 2008 for the funding of grants to secondary schools, running costs for Community and Comprehensive Schools and annual grants to VECs.In relation to third level I would like to point out that public investment in higher education has increased significantly over the last decade. When all higher education funding is taken into account, the overall provision by the Department of Education and Science for the sector amounts to some €2 billion for 2008. This is an increase of some 25% since 2005, when the provision amounted to €1.6 billion and an increase of some 135% on the €850 million provided in 1997.Between 2002 and 2007, expenditure on Further Education has increased by over 50%, from €256m to €392m.  In terms of extending opportunity, this increased expenditure meant that in 2007, nearly 49,000 places were provided in further education courses compared with under 44,000 places in 2002. In addition, the adult literacy programme provided for 44,000 learners in 2007 compared with 28,000 in 2002.Of course, all Programme for Government commitments to improve public services, including those in the education sector, are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management.  Consequently, the competing demands for funding within the education sector must be considered in the context of the overall economic and budgetary position that might prevail in the coming years.

St. Michael's House Special School, Colaiste Dhulaigh and Integrate Ireland Language and Training Ltd (IILT) were announced as the three educational institutions which would transfer to Greendale. As IILT will cease providing direct tuition in July 2008, there is no longer a need for the company to transfer to Greendale. However, St. Michael's House and Colaiste Dhulaigh will continue to use Greendale and will ensure that the school premises will continue to be used for educational purposes.

The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30th September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued to all primary schools each year.Posts allocated on the basis of this staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment). In particular, school authorities should ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.Data submitted to my Department by the Board of Management of the school referred to by the Deputy, indicates that the enrolment in the school on 30th September 2006 was 319 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0020/2007), which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2007/08 school year is a Principal and 12 mainstream class teachers.According to data submitted by the Board of Management the enrolment on 30th September 2007 was 326 pupils. In accordance with the staffing schedule (Circular 0010/2008), which is also available on my Department's website at www.education.ie and a hard copy of which has been issued to all primary schools, the mainstream staffing in the school for the 2008/09 school year will remain at a Principal and 12 mainstream class teachers.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established to adjudicate on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Details of the criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule. The criteria are also available in Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools) which is available on my Department's website.The first meeting of the Appeal Board took place on 20th May, 2008. Further meetings will be held in June and October, 2008. The closing dates for receipt of appeals are 20 June and 10 October respectively. Appeals must be submitted to Primary Payments Section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made. The standard application form is available from Primary Payments Section or on my Department's website.The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

I understand that the breach of the standard occurred on 17 July 2007 following a period of wet weather.  Follow-up sampling was carried out on 23 July 2007 and the results were clear. The unusually high rainfall last summer appears to have been a factor in the failure of certain bathing areas to achieve the required standards.Under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme, Youghal — together with nearby Claycastle — will be incorporated into the Youghal sewerage scheme at an estimated cost of €14.42 million.

Under the Local Government (Representational Payment for Members) Regulations, 2001 (S.I. No. 552 of 2001), the RP for county and city councillors is specifically related to the basic amount of a senator's salary and is currently €17,175 per annum. As such, there is no linkage to the long service increments payable to senators, who accrue the necessary service. While I have no proposals to amend the current situation in regard to the RP, I should point out that all councillors have benefited from the recent review of the financial supports payable to them. The review resulted in significant improvements in these supports, all of which took effect from 1 January 2007.

These assessments were taken into account in preparing the Water Services Investment Programme 2007 -2009.  However, given the level of competing demands for the available funding, and the priorities identified by the elected members of Mayo County Council, it was not possible to include the Binghamstown scheme in the current Programme.

This report is available on the Agency's website: www.epa.ieThe Programme for Government clearly sets out the approach to waste management that will be reflected in national policy in the years ahead.  It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste.  This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration.  This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the Landfill Directive to divert biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.To assist the process of ensuring that our waste management system can act in support of these objectives my Department has initiated a major review of waste management policy as set out in the Programme for Government.  The review will chart a new way forward.  Given the need to accelerate movement away from landfill quite dramatically, we need to examine all the technologies that can contribute to optimising our environmental performance in relation to waste.  The review will be designed, in addition, to support the necessary legal, institutional and policy framework to achieve international best practice in the management of our waste.  If the outcome of the review indicates a need for significant legislative changes I will bring the necessary proposals to Government in this regard.

Under the Planning and Development Acts the Minister is specifically precluded from involvement in a matter for which the Board has statutory responsibility.My Department and I hold regular consultations with stakeholders in the context of the ongoing implementation of Government policy on waste management.  Consulting widely, with a range of stakeholders, is designed to ensure that my Department and I have as full as possible an understanding of the issues and concerns of stakeholders and are therefore in a position to address them, where it is possible and appropriate to do so.  Such consultations are also useful to assist me and my Department in keeping up to date on alternative technologies to landfill and to traditional incineration.  In July 2007 I met with an environmental consultant acting on behalf of the proposers of the project.  The purpose of this meeting, and of a separate meeting with my Department, was to outline a form of thermal treatment of waste which, it is suggested, differs from conventional municipal waste incineration.  There was, of course, no question of these discussions comprehending matters proper to the physical planning or environmental licensing processes from which I, and my Department, are precluded from involvement.The Programme for Government clearly sets out the approach to waste management that will be reflected in national policy in the years ahead.  It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, re-use and recycling of our waste.  This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration.

It is firmly grounded in a continuing commitment to the waste hierarchy with a renewed drive towards the achievement of international best practice in the reduction, re-use and recycling of our waste. This, coupled with an increasing emphasis on technologies for the mechanical and biological treatment of waste, will significantly reduce potential reliance on landfill and incineration. This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill. Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.To assist the process of ensuring that our waste management system can act in support of these objectives my Department has initiated the major review of waste management policy foreseen in the Government's policy programme and this will get underway shortly. This will be designed to support the necessary legal, institutional and policy framework to achieve international best practice in the management of our waste. The terms of reference require that the review be concluded as soon as possible and no later than within one year.

The Bill is included in the Government's Legislative Programme for publication in the current session.

In April 2008, the Council submitted proposals for a remedial works scheme on the estate.  My Department is currently considering these proposals and a response will issue shortly.

The proposal, however, did not address a number of issues that arose in the pilot phase and did not meet with public procurement policy. A letter to that effect issued from my Department in April 2007.At the end of April 2008, my Department received a revised proposal from the Council, and, following its consideration, a request for additional information on the proposal was made to the Council at the end of May 2008.  This information is still outstanding.Budget costs for the next phase have not yet been approved. The Council has already received funding of €1.1 million for the pilot phase of the scheme.

The offer was revoked on the 21st of December 2007, as the letter of offer lapsed after one year, as set out under the terms of the scheme.  A request for payment was received at a later stage and still reviewed for payment but, as the invoice for work predated the original letter of offer by a month, the applicant was not eligible for payment under the rules of the scheme.  The applicant was informed of this earlier this year.
