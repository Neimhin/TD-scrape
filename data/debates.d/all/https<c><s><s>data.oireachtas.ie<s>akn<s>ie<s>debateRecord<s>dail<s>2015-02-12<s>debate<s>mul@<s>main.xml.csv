There are no specific actions outlined in the action plan and I want to pursue the Minister's thoughts on this area.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Finance for growth of business is of enormous importance, and a chapter has been devoted to it in Action Plan for Jobs 2015. Irish small and medium enterprises, SMEs, traditionally have had a very high reliance on banks and bank debt. This has been a particular problem in the face of the radical restructuring in our banks and the constraints that has put on lending. Government strategy has therefore focused on a number of strands: improving access to bank credit; developing sources of funding alternative to the traditional banks; and helping enterprises to better manage and structure their financial affairs. As the Deputy is aware, a number of alternative funding sources have been developed, and this year the establishment of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is designed to develop new funding products for SMEs and to facilitate new entrants. Its target is to provide €800 million in new finance to SMEs.  The extension of the mandate of the Credit Review Office has been an important support to enterprises experiencing difficulty. It has had a strong track record in overturning bank decisions. The establishment of the State bodies group involving the Central Bank, the Office of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance along with sectoral agencies and Departments has also ensured a continuing focus on restructuring within the finance sector to meet the needs of SMEs. Targets have been set by the Central Bank for the pillar banks to engage with businesses that require debt restructuring. I understand these targets are being met. We have introduced provisions for SMEs to apply for examinership in the Circuit Court, making it cheaper and easier for them to do so. As part of the review of the credit guarantee scheme, CGS, and on foot of concerns raised by the Credit Review Office and business representative organisations, I have decided to take action to assist SMEs whose banks have left or are leaving the Irish SME lending market. This will see a new CGS in 2015 in accordance with the terms of the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, which will allow guarantees for refinancing loans where an SME's bank has exited or is exiting the Irish SME market. This new scheme will also increase the maximum length of guarantees under the CGS from three years to seven years. Continuing to address all finance-related issues for business will remain a priority for this Government, and further actions will be developed to help Irish businesses to grow and prosper.

In cases of which I have been made aware, one of the main banks - not a pillar bank - is actively exiting the SME market and trying to sell loans off to various venture or vulture funds. The pillar banks have put facilities in place, but the bank that is exiting the SME market will not accept them. Will the Minister's proposals assist companies that are viable? The two companies I am dealing with, each employing 50 people, face the sale of their bank loans to someone they do not know. When will the Minister for Finance publish targets for the restructuring of SME debt? They should be published every quarter so that we can see how banks are doing, in the same way as for the mortgage market.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	It is precisely as the Deputy outlines. The idea is that the terms of the credit guarantee scheme, which provides a guarantee of up to 75% on the tranche of the loan covered by the guarantee, will change to 80% in the new revision. This will allow the guarantee to be used as an instrument to support businesses in cases in which their bank is exiting. It is to deal with this sort of circumstances the Deputy is dealing with. We are working to introduce that in the Dáil as quickly as possible. The Minister for Finance has answered questions on the targets. The Central Bank sets those targets. It has reported that they are on track. There is relevant information in the banks' annual reports, which the Deputy could read. The Central Bank certainly sees the setting of targets as an important aspect of helping distressed SME borrowers into a long-term sustainable position. I do not have the details on when the additional targets will be published.

Will it be done this session? Will it be done before Easter? The scheme was identified as flawed in October 2013, when the Department reviewed it. The new element the Minister has introduced this morning is absolutely vital and urgent because the bank I am referring to, which is one of the main players, is actively putting loans on the market. People need protection. The Minister and the Government are sleepwalking while many small businesses are being destroyed by legacy debt. They are willing to face up to it and enter into a package. The two pillar banks are putting facilities in place, but while we await a solution exactly as the Minister has outlined, our hands are tied and we can do nothing. Debts are being sold week by week and the scheme will be too late. Will the revised credit guarantee scheme with this new element be introduced before the Easter recess?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	There is no question of the Government sleepwalking. Every year we introduce a new initiative. This year the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland will provide new access to €800 million of credit for SMEs. We have extended the mandate of the Credit Review Office every year, so it now deals with loans of up to €3 million. Reviewing a guarantee is complex legislation because it involves the taxpayer underwriting commitments entered into by others. There are delicate legal issues that must be dealt with in introducing such legislation. We are making sure we get it right. I assure the Deputy that we are dealing with this as a matter of extreme urgency.

We are also investigating the response of State organisations to women in enterprise. People from low or low-to-middle income backgrounds also have difficulties with regard to enterprise. What supports is the Government providing to ensure that this sector of society has full access to enterprise?
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Under the Action Plan for Jobs, the Government has published an array of actions designed to ensure full employment by 2018. The plan also contains a suite of actions to promote entrepreneurship, to encourage people to start their own businesses and to help individuals with a viable business idea to access crucial start-up funding. These supports are of course available to all individuals regardless of their socioeconomic background. In order to facilitate easy access to such programmes, the Department has established a network of 31 local enterprise offices, LEOs, located within local authorities as a first-stop shop to access all Government programmes. The LEOs have protocols in place with the Department of Social Protection, SOLAS, the Revenue Commissioners and other agencies to ensure persons from all backgrounds can get the help they need in an accessible way. These include access to back to work enterprise allowances, minor support grants and secondary benefits for people who have been out of work. Services offered by the LEO network include training and mentoring of those whose business experience may be limited so that they can get appropriate support and guidance.In addition, it supports applications by clients to Microfinance Ireland. This source of lending is specifically designed for persons who do not have easy access to the banking system. Local enterprise offices have a service level agreement with Enterprise Ireland which specifically provides for seamless access for LEO clients to other Enterprise Ireland programmes. It is encouraging that we are seeing good growth in start-ups and in the ambition of people to start a business. There were approximately 18,000 new business registrations last year. One of the objectives of our entrepreneurship strategy is to see an increase in the number of people from what might be regarded as disadvantaged backgrounds and other under-represented groups who start their own businesses.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I welcome the Minister of State's answer. In fairness, he has indicated a number of actions that are being used to help people who have been unemployed or who have had difficulties obtaining finance. Many sectors have experienced unemployment and difficulty in obtaining finance and, as such, it is not the fact that people's immediate financial experience might place them in the low-paid bracket that I am necessarily trying to get at. The Minister of State probably knows what I am trying to get at. I am trying to find out what can be done in future to ensure that the energy, enthusiasm, skills and ability of people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds can be harnessed for the benefit of enterprise. For example, when women have difficulties gaining access to enterprise, it means we are shutting out 50% of the skills available to the State to grow the economy. What research has been done on the socioeconomic backgrounds of the individuals who are accessing the supports the State is providing? If we could obtain those statistics, we could then start to provide specific supports for people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, just as we do for women.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	This is an area that concerns me and the Tánaiste. The establishment of Intreo offices has been very positive. The Department of Social Protection has moved from what might be termed a passive payment model to an activation model. Staff in Intreo offices are very linked in with local enterprise offices and other agencies to ensure that people who have business ideas get the support they need, whether through LEOs or SOLAS, to establish their businesses or test their ideas. Deputy Tóibín and I are on the same page regarding the view that a person's socioeconomic circumstances should never be a barrier to accessing business opportunities. There is an old adage that there is a good book in everyone, but I also consider that there is a good business idea in everyone, if it could only be brought out by those who can provide support and mentorship. There are start-your-own-business courses operated by Leader partnership companies and the back to work enterprise allowance is a further important initiative. We included particular measures in the last budget, including the start-up relief entrepreneurship scheme, which is very positive for those moving from the PAYE sector into their own businesses. Protocols have been established between the Department of Social Protection, LEOs and Enterprise Ireland to support people from lower-income backgrounds, particularly those moving from welfare to work, to help them establish their own businesses. Microfinance Ireland plays a significant role in assisting entrepreneurs who have difficulty accessing capital on foot of issues around collateral and helps them to set up their own businesses at a micro level.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	While I appreciate what the Minister of State has said, the first thing we need to do is to measure exactly what is happening within the system. If one cannot measure, one cannot manage. If we do not have the statistics to identify exactly the incidence of success and failure, it is very hard to put things in place. There is a seeding ground for enterprise which involves those who are the sons and daughters of entrepreneurs themselves, people from middle management in companies, people with a high level of education and those with access to finance. Geography is also an enormous factor because of the issue of access to markets. I call on the Government to implement a method of obtaining the necessary statistics to provide us with a clear insight into the incidence of entrepreneurship at all levels of society and to establish an implementation group to ensure that the tools the Government is currently using can be added to if necessary to allow us to harness the energies of everyone in society.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	A customer service review is being undertaken with LEOs. The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and I are determined to ensure that those metrics are very strong. We have come from a position of massively high unemployment and our aim is to get unemployment under 10% by the end of the year with a view to moving towards full employment. As such, there is an understanding across the agencies in the system that a strong effort is required to encourage people to move from welfare to work, including opportunities for people to establish their own businesses. That data is very important. It is not something I have at my fingertips at the moment, but to the best of my knowledge it is available across the system. Deputy Tóibín is absolutely right that we need to have proper metrics where we are trying to crack a problem. I take that on board. However, there are a range of programmes across the country that are designed to bring people from welfare into a position in which they are setting up their own businesses. For example, I am familiar in my own constituency with the IgnYte programme, which is supported by the Department of Social Protection and my own Department and operated by a local education development agency working with The Mill enterprise centre in Drogheda. The programme aims to encourage people to set up their own businesses when they are moving from welfare to work. A lot of this is about changing the culture and people's expectations of themselves. Everyone can start up a business and there should not be any socioeconomic barriers to doing so. We are all determined to ensure that any barriers are removed.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	The Government has abandoned job creation in County Tipperary over the last four years. Yesterday, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, announced a regional strategy which excluded the county and further disadvantaged its towns. What specific steps does the Minister intend to take to create jobs in County Tipperary? I ask him to urgently and immediately amend the plan he announced yesterday to ensure that it includes County Tipperary and its towns.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I assure the Deputy that every county, including Tipperary, is included in our regional strategy. No one is excluded. The annual employment survey shows that 68 jobs were created and 77 were lost among IDA client companies in Tipperary in 2012. In 2013, 202 jobs were created while 521 were lost, and in 2014, 64 jobs were created while 62 were lost. In the same three-year period, there were a total of 12 site visits to County Tipperary: five in 2012, four in 2013 and three in 2014. For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, including the potential impact on any future property transactions that might arise from a possible investment, it is prudent to provide details of such visits on a county-by-county basis only, although the Deputy sought details for different parts of the county. While the IDA seeks to influence the choice of location, decisions on where to visit and where to locate are taken in all cases by the investor. Since the economic crash, enterprises have been undergoing a difficult transition. Jobs in many sectors have proved unsustainable. For example, the number of people employed in construction in Tipperary fell by 4,800 during the crash. Progress is now being made, however. Employment in companies supported by both IDA and Enterprise Ireland grew in Tipperary in 2014 for the first time since the crash. In the last four years, unemployment levels have fallen in Tipperary by 2,754, which is a decrease of 16%. More needs to be done to build on this trend. The Action Plan for Jobs has been designed to introduce measures right across the Government to support job growth and reduce unemployment. We are determined to ensure that every region will benefit from the recovery. Yesterday, I announced with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste the details of a comprehensive new strategy to support enterprise growth and job creation at regional level. The regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative seeks to build on the success of the annual Action Plan for Jobs at national level by developing locally driven plans that can build on the strengths and opportunities identified in each region. The strategy will provide up to €250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development. This includes the roll-out of a five-year €150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions. This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations. A further sum of up to €100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions in starting up, growing and exporting, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	Unemployment figures in County Tipperary are well in excess of 14,000, which is significantly above the national average. Towns like Carrick-on-Suir and Nenagh, which did not benefit from the Celtic tiger, now find themselves with unemployment levels that are more than double the national average. In respect of job creation by IDA companies in 2014, a mere 64 jobs were created in the county, 48 in south Tipperary and 16 in north Tipperary. In 2014, 78% of all IDA jobs were created in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway while 64 out of 15,000 jobs were created in County Tipperary. The county has been abandoned and forgotten about by the Government. Yesterday's announcement further disadvantages the county. What specific steps will the Minister take to ensure that job creation is available for the towns of Tipperary?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I point out to the Deputy that the IDA employment is about 5% of total employment in Tipperary. A total of 95% of enterprise and employment is outside that sector. The Deputy's sole focus on foreign investment undersells the huge amount of enterprise in Tipperary and the south east. Employment levels in the south east have grown by 18,000 in the past two and a half years. There is a strong recovery there. The Deputy quotes figures for the IDA. I could quote figures for Enterprise Ireland. A total of 85% of new jobs related to Enterprise Ireland are outside Dublin. We are seeing strong growth in our regions based on our own enterprises which is the future we need to develop. This regional enterprise strategy strengthens the backbone of property options available in every region and also sets out a challenge and opportunity for our regions, including Tipperary, to identify areas of opportunity and to plan actions that will implement and realise those opportunities. I invite the Deputy to participate in that programme because it will respond to the needs of enterprise in his area, seek to get collaboration and provide new money to underpin such collaboration.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	The Minister's announcement yesterday says nothing about towns in Tipperary. It talks about the investment over the coming years in building advance manufacturing and office facilities in Sligo, Tralee, Castlebar, Galway, Dundalk, Limerick, Athlone, Carlow and Waterford. There is no mention of any town in Tipperary or the building of advance factories or office facilities on any of the sites that are available throughout the county, in Tipperary town, Archerstown in Thurles, Lisboney in Nenagh, Benamore at Roscrea, Clonmel, Cashel or Carrick-on-Suir. It is quite obvious that there is no commitment to job creation for County Tipperary through IDA companies into the future. I want to see the plan the Minister announced yesterday amended to include County Tipperary specifically.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I think the Deputy is talking nonsense. One fifth of the money we presented yesterday is going to a number of advance facilities in the six regions outside the Dublin area. In each region, 80% of the revenue will be available for other solutions in which every county and region can participate. However, the Deputy insists on taking a very narrow view of where employment growth will come from. Yes, foreign investment has a role to play but the Deputy should talk to his own enterprises. Where are the opportunities in Tipperary? The food sector is having a fantastic period of growth. Many Irish companies are investing in the future because milk quotas are coming to an end. Glanbia has made investments which it expects will leverage 1,600 additional people at work providing milk and transporting and supporting that enterprise. There are huge opportunities that each region can build. The Deputy insists on taking a very narrow focus on where enterprise grows. Employment is growing in the south east and the mid-west and we need to build on that. People like the Deputy need to get behind those people with new ideas and see how they can be realised. That is what this is about. There is money out there for ideas to come forward from the regions which we will support on the basis of the best quality proposals. I invite the Deputy to participate in a real opportunity for our regions instead of just griping about what is going on.

I know he has asked the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to begin pre-legislative scrutiny on the minimum wage Bill. I want to focus our discussion zero-hours contracts. Will they be the subject of separate action on the part of the Minister of State and will they come under the remit of the low pay commission? In particular, I want to see what work is under way at European level around zero-hours contracts, which are becoming a very unfortunate phenomenon of the economic recovery.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	The Government is taking a number of initiatives to ensure that the economic recovery that is under way is benefiting all citizens and that the jobs we are helping to create are decent jobs with decent pay. The setting up of a low pay commission is one of the key commitments in the statement of Government priorities agreed last July. The principal function of the low pay commission will be to examine and make recommendations each year to the Minister on the national minimum wage with a view to ensuring that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. Alongside examining the national minimum wage, the low pay commission will also be tasked with examining matters related generally to the functions of the commission under the Act. This work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the commission in February of each year. In addition, in the discharging of its function, the commission will be required to make recommendations that are evidence-based using a suite of agreed data sets or, where required, based on bespoke research undertaken at the behest of the commission. It is intended that the interim membership will constitute the commission when it is established on a statutory basis. A particular function of the commission will be to ensure that any advice or recommendations it makes to Government is evidence-based utilising agreed data; carrying out research and consultations with employers, workers and their representatives; and taking written and oral evidence from a wide range of organisations. With a view to ensuring that the low pay commission is in a position to carry out its functions as soon as possible, the commission, in the first instance, will be established on an interim basis in the next few weeks. Legislation to provide for the establishment of the low pay commission on a statutory basis will be published as soon as possible thereafter with a view to its enactment as soon as possible in 2015. Another key commitment of Government provided for in the statement of Government priorities is the commissioning of a study into the prevalence of zero-hours and low-hours contracts and the impact of such contracts on employees. Earlier this week, I announced the appointment of the University of Limerick to carry out the study. The appointment of UL follows a competitive tendering process. The key objectives of the study are to fill the gap that currently exists in terms of the hard data in that area, to assess the impact of zero-hours and low-hours contracts on employees and to enable me to make any evidence-based policy recommendations I can to Government on foot of the study. I have asked the group to come back to me with specific recommendations pertaining to the three pieces of legislation in particular that govern this area.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
All sectors of the economy, both public and private, will come within the scope of the study, including the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors in particular. The study will examine how zero-hours and low-hours contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees. It will assess the advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of employer and employee and assess the current employment rights legislation as it applies to employees on such contracts. The study will also consider recent developments in other jurisdictions, including the UK in particular. It is expected that a wide range of stakeholders will be canvassed to contribute to the study, including employers, trade unions, relevant Departments and relevant State bodies. I expect the study to be completed within six months of commencement. While I do not want to anticipate the outcome of the study or the Government's consideration of the study's findings, I have made it clear that if the study finds such work contracts have a serious and detrimental impact on citizens then the Government will act.

Will the group have the chance to speak to workers? Zero-hours contracts are not completely bad if there are some companies that need them, but some companies are abusing them and treating workers like the navvies in England - wait on a corner and see whether a man comes along and picks you up. We cannot allow that to happen. We must have some respect and dignity for workers. It is important that whatever solution we come up with does not throw everything out. It is also important that it is pursued at European level because there is no sense in us having one set of protections while there are completely different rules in another part of the jurisdiction that are used as a competitive advantage and workers' conditions are used by companies to gain competitive advantage in what is an increasingly cruel global market.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	We know from the Office for National Statistics in the UK and work carried out annually by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development that there are about 32,000 zero-hours contracts in Northern Ireland. Those figures are very worrying. We have a different system here where the protections of the Organisation of Working Time Act are applied to people in certain circumstances. There has been huge debate nationally and internationally on this.The Deputy will agree there is hard data evidence to indicate to us the extent and prevalence of this problem. We have widened the study out to include low-hour contracts, contracts of eight hours or under, which are possibly more common than zero-hour contracts. There is a significant debate about this issue both nationally and internationally. People in Ireland will be familiar with the debate in the UK where it is believed there are approximately 1.4 million such contracts in operation. We want to ensure the jobs we are creating are decent, sustainable and pay well. We want to ensure work pays and that it conforms to my dignity of work and dignity at work agenda, an agenda to which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Protection are committed.

Will the Minister of State express his views, if he wishes to, on the position of the largest retail company in the country writing to all of its workers, distancing itself from a Labour Court recommendation? The Labour Court has been the foundation of our industrial relations policy since its establishment. While its recommendations are not binding, the notion that its recommendations can be treated with such disdain by one of the largest retail employers is wrong. I accept the Minister of State may not be in a position to express his views on this. However, the fact the company has written to every one of its employees advising them of adverse consequences if they pursue proper industrial relations avenues is a sad day for Irish business.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	We always need to be very conscious of areas such as this. I am aware of developments in the particular firm in question and its engagement, or lack thereof, with the trade union representing its workers. It would be unwise of me to comment any further as the situation is evolving. From the Government’s perspective, we would always encourage Labour Court recommendations to be respected. The Labour Court is a very key piece of our industrial relations machinery and is very important for harmonious industrial relations between employers and employees. It is an important institution of the State that has served us well and is respected by everyone. It should never be undermined in any way. Developments in the company in question are concerning. Suffice to say, the Government always encourages, hopes and expects that all parties involved in the industrial relations machinery of the State will respect its recommendations and proposals.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	The purpose of the negotiations on a transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, is to reduce barriers to trade and investment in order to generate jobs and growth. Based on European Commission estimates, an ambitious TTIP could generate 400,000 jobs. The gains for Ireland could be double this in proportionate terms, approximately 8,000 additional jobs, because of the significant flows of trade between Ireland and the US. The scope of the European Commission’s mandate to negotiate with the United States on a TTIP includes investment protection and investor state dispute settlement, ISDS. The aim is to promote more two-way investment between the US and EU with high standards of protection for investors. This mandate has been supported by all member states, including Ireland. All of the EU’s free trade agreements seek to provide EU investors abroad with a level of protection similar to that which they would obtain in the EU. This is important for Irish investors abroad. Ireland does not have bilateral investment treaties. In Ireland, guarantees to investors that they will not be treated in a discriminatory manner are provided by virtue of Article 43 of our Constitution. However, in other EU member states this protection is provided through bilateral investment treaties with third countries that include ISDS. Nine member states have such treaties with the US. TTIP would replace these. International experience points to a wide disparity of bilateral investment agreement provisions. Some cases taken by investors under some of these have justifiably brought criticism of ISDS as a mechanism. The TTIP negotiations give the EU an opportunity to make improvements and create a new generation ISDS model that addresses the weaknesses identified in other agreements. Indeed, the existing mandate already provides important provisions protecting the right of government to regulate sectors. I support the European Commission in its continuing work to modify and improve the existing models and through the public consultation which it has conducted. In the case of the recently concluded negotiations between the EU and Canada, for example, a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation could only arise when there is denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings; a fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency, in judicial and administrative proceedings; manifest arbitrariness; targeted discrimination on manifestly wrongful grounds, such as gender, race or religious belief; or abusive treatment of investors, such as coercion, duress and harassment. In addition, in the Canada agreement, there is provision for a list of arbitrators pre-agreed by the EU and Canada. The European Commission has indicated it will engage in further consultations with member states, the European Parliament and other stakeholders and that, following these consultations, it will develop specific proposals for the TTIP negotiations. I very much welcome this approach and it is important to take time to have open and constructive discussion following the Commission’s report that will inform the next steps. At this stage, there are no negotiations taking place with the United States on this aspect of the proposed agreement. Ultimately, this element, as indeed other elements of the mandate, will only be included if the overall outcome is satisfactory to the EU.

There is a concern that low-grade, hormone-injected and genetically modified beef products from the US may gain access to the Irish market. Questions have arisen about the investor state dispute mechanism which would appear to undermine the democratic foundations of the State. Questions have also arisen over the reduction in wages and conditions of employment for workers. There is considerable concern that transnational corporations could bypass the courts through the dispute resolution mechanism.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	The idea of low-grade or genetically modified beef coming into Europe has been explicitly excluded in the mandate. That is not an eventuality that the EU would countenance. In respect of wages and employment conditions, the Department has commissioned some research into this which indicates there would be benefits through improvements in wages, employment, exports and growth. The balance sheet is positive on all aspects of employment and working conditions. I recognise there are concerns in any trade negotiations because barriers will come down. Obviously, those sectors behind some large barriers will face more competition. Other opportunities, however, will arise in sectors where Europe can now get into US markets, where previously there were substantial barriers to European businesses. It is a two-way process and there will always be some level of trading to be agreed. Both sides will have to be satisfied that the reduction in trade barriers is an improvement. Every assessment would show the reduction of such barriers improves the opportunities in both countries. Trade barriers are not helpful by pushing up costs and representing a loss. While I understand the Deputy’s concerns, these are negotiations which will be done in a very open and transparent way and people will have an opportunity to input into them.

Is the Minister prepared to advise the Dáil on an ongoing, say quarterly, basis on the conduct and the progress of these negotiations?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	As Deputy Mick Wallace has a later question on this very topic, I do not want to encroach on it now. Suffice to say, these have been very open negotiations. There are briefings after every session and the information is available on the public record to Members of the European Parliament. I have engaged in several consultations with the relevant committees. I am happy to appear before any committee again at any point on these discussions.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	This question concerns the Johnson & Johnson ALZA plant at in Cashel, County Tipperary, which has been vacant for some time. It is a state-of-the-art facility and I am looking for an update on the situation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I am informed by IDA Ireland that the former Johnson & Johnson ALZA plant in Cashel is in the process of changing hands. IDA Ireland understands that discussions between the company, Johnson & Johnson, and a private investment entity are ongoing. IDA Ireland is contacting the new owner through Johnson & Johnson. I have asked IDA Ireland to work with the new owner to try to deliver high value sustainable jobs for Cashel. The Deputy appreciates that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage. The agency informs me that there were three site visits by potential investors to County Tipperary in 2014. In respect of Cashel, I am informed by IDA Ireland that it is also working with the Ranbaxy pharmaceutical facility in Cashel in supporting plans to boost productivity on the site. In County Tipperary as a whole, there are 11 IDA Ireland client companies employing 3,370 people in full and part-time employment. Cashel, located in south Tipperary, is marketed by IDA Ireland as part of the south-east region along with counties Waterford, Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny. The main clusters that have emerged in the south east are high-value manufacturing, pharmaceutical, medical devices and engineering, and international financial services. We are developing a regional enterprise strategy for the south east and for the mid-west. We seek to develop all aspects, multinational and the much larger domestic enterprise sector, in the course of those plans.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	The former Johnson & Johnson ALZA plant in Cashel is a state-of-the-art facility. Unfortunately, it has been vacant for some time and I thought there would have been a stronger push by the IDA to fill the plant. In the town of Cashel, 1,060 people are on the live register. The town needs employment and there is no doubt it should be possible to install a new occupant in the plant. This is particularly true in light of the other flagship pharmaceutical and medical industries in the county, Abbott Ireland Vascular Division, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Boston Scientific and others. I ask the Minister and the IDA to ensure the plant is occupied as soon as possible.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I assure the Deputy that no effort is spared by the IDA to pursue opportunities for the site. It is state of the art. If there was any slacking on the part of the IDA, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, would keep them up to their job. He is regularly in contact about opportunities in the area. The plant is owned by Johnson & Johnson and it is not an IDA plant. There is more than one party to this. There is close collaboration between the IDA and Johnson & Johnson and we intend that the same relationship will be developed in the hands of the new owner. We are anxious to see the facility, which is a fantastic asset to the region, fully utilised.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	We have broached the subject a number of times. It was interesting to see comments by the former Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, who said: "One should not forget that traditional methods of conducting international trade negotiations, characterised as they are by confidentiality and limited public participation, are ill-equipped to generate the legitimacy necessary in such high stakes talks." She argues that things need to be different from now on and that citizens need a stronger role. She has been critical of the lack of citizen participation in the TTIP negotiations to date.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	To be fair, that has been reflected in the approach of Commissioner Malmström. There is a whole new approach being adopted, with greater engagement by citizens than has occurred previously in trade negotiations. The purpose of the TTIP negotiations is to generate jobs and growth by reducing barriers to trade and investment. As I mentioned to Deputy Seamus Healy, there is potential for 400,000 jobs across the EU and 8,000 additional jobs in Ireland from an ambitious trade agreement. I welcome the wide interest in these negotiations and the opportunities it presents for constructive engagement and discussion on issues arising in the negotiations. I have sought to provide opportunity for open discussion. During the course of the past year, I have briefed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. In June 2014, I hosted a conference in Dublin Castle for stakeholders, including Oireachtas Members. Last December, I participated in a round-table discussion with a range of stakeholders organised by the European Parliament’s office in Dublin. I plan to continue these engagements with the Oireachtas and MEPs. The publication in the next few weeks of the study commissioned by my Department on the opportunities of the TTIP for Ireland will provide further opportunity for engagement and openness on the issues of interest to us in these negotiations. The European Commission is the EU’s negotiator in TTIP. Last November, the European Council of trade Ministers, which I attended, underlined the importance of better communicating the scope and the benefits of TTIP and called for enhanced transparency and dialogue with civil society. Commissioner Malmström’s response to this call for improving transparency and openness in the negotiations has been positive. The European Commission is making public more EU negotiating texts and is providing access to TTIP texts to all Members of the European Parliament. Fewer TTIP negotiating documents are classified as EU restricted. Engagement with stakeholders during the TTIP negotiating rounds is now a permanent feature. Last week in Brussels, during the eighth round, in excess of 80 stakeholders from both sides of the Atlantic presented their views on the various aspects of the negotiations. This provides further opportunity for openness and transparency in direct stakeholder engagement with the negotiators.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	The Minister is telling us that everything is open and transparent but many people feel otherwise. The Minister is aware of the group, Corporate Europe Observatory, which has taken a close look at this. There is fierce opposition to the far-reaching rights for foreign investors in this treaty. There are fears they will be given the right to undermine existing legislation. It is almost as if they will be given the opportunity to write their own legislation. Going against what the Minister says in his answer, Ms Emily O'Reilly has raised the point that the US has sought to veto access to some documents. She is concerned. For the US to say that it will be unhappy if certain documents are disclosed is, according to Ms. O'Reilly, not good enough. It gives the US a veto over disclosure of certain documents, which is worrying. Coming up with the final document, presenting it to people, telling them that this is what we are doing and letting them say "Yes" or "No" to it at that stage is not good enough. There must be greater engagement with the citizens throughout the process if people will be content with the final outcome.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	There is exactly that. We have had eight rounds and after every round there has been an open and transparent opportunity for people to express views. Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. It is a rolling process. I acknowledged that there are people who are critics but I ask the Deputy to look honestly at what is in the document. I quoted to Deputy Healy what went into the Canadian document to protect investors. They can only call on the investor dispute mechanism if they are faced with a fine denial of justice in criminal or administrative procedures, if there has been a fundamental breach of due process, if there has been manifest arbitrariness in the way they have been treated, or if there has been targeted discrimination. The elements that go into the improved investor-state dispute settlements, ISDS, over time are narrowing the ranges where they can pursue complaints and these elements are improving the process. In the mandate, we have excluded rafts of things that the agreement cannot enter into, including GMO, the right to regulate or the right to have public services provided through the public sector.These things have been ring-fenced and are not party to these negotiations. One must distinguish between opposition that simply is opposed to any trade and that which is founded on elements and consideration of weaknesses or whatever. This is an important distinction, and the reason there has been so much consultation is in order that there can be a rational debate in which people examine each item. It is a negotiation, and not everything will be fully in the open. The Deputy will not know final positions until the end, and if he ever has been in negotiation, he will know that that is the way negotiations evolve.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	It is not radical to state that, generally speaking, large corporations in the developed world and probably in the undeveloped world have more power than ordinary people. That is not rocket science. I am not against everything but I am concerned about whether the interests of the citizen will be best protected by whatever we end up with. In her latest book, Naomi Klein has addressed the point that the TTIP and many other extant trade and investment rules actually make it difficult to challenge corporations in how they deal with fossil fuels, for example, and so on. They have incredible rights. I believe there probably is more discussion on this issue in Europe than in Ireland. Given that the mainstream media do not appear to have an interest in the TTIP, can the Minister provide for Members an analysis of his perceptions on what has been negotiated thus far and what is being discussed? Can the Minister give Members a breakdown of what it currently means to Ireland in black and white? There is confusion at the moment. If the Minister could do away with the confusion, he might get greater acceptance from those who are in opposition to this process. It would be great if the Department were able to state how this would and would not affect Ireland.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	One can be sceptical of enterprises and investment, but just a moment ago Deputy Healy stated that there was not enough international investment and that big corporations were not coming in and investing enough.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	What I said was that we were not getting our fair share of it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	Investment is good for countries, but it will only come if there is a reasonable level of protection. That is why these things have been there. Investors must be protected from arbitrary actions by Governments or other bodies such as courts. That is why investment protection is part of these agreements. Ireland has not needed it because it has a strong Constitution that provides that to people, and we have not had experience of huge exploitation or abuses by foreign enterprise investing in Ireland. These mechanisms are designed to ensure that rules are applied in a fair manner. That is their purpose, but to take the Deputy's point, the Department has commissioned work that will provide a sector-by-sector indication of opportunities and threats for Ireland, which will be published in the near future. I hope this will add to the debate. Moreover, of course there are concerns. As the Deputy is aware, there are concerns about beef coming into Ireland, but there also are hopes in respect of cheese going to the United States. Any such trade negotiation is a two-way process and, ultimately, the Government must balance them out. That is always an element of negotiation.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The Workplace Relations Bill passed by the Dáil a few weeks ago was a missed opportunity to deal with an issue that, as the Minister has previously acknowledged, must be addressed. Normally, when an employee severs his or her relationship with an employer, he or she no longer has access to the State's industrial relations machinery. In most instances this makes perfect sense, but the one instance in which it does not is of course with regard to people's pensions. People must be given a voice when their material living standards can potentially be dramatically affected. Given that this has not been done within the Bill that Members just passed, what will the Government do to deal with this issue?
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	I thank Deputy Clare Daly for tabling this important question. I fully appreciate the concerns of retired and deferred members of pension schemes whose schemes are being restructured, particularly where such restructuring may have an impact on existing or potential pension benefits. In this regard, the question of pensioner groups having access to the State’s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is an issue in which I have a deep interest and to which I have given careful consideration. In so doing, I have borne in mind that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature as regards access to both the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would fundamentally alter the conduct of industrial relations. As it stands, where changes to pension schemes are negotiated at company level, whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise, the outcome of that engagement cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Rather, any proposed changes to the scheme are effected through the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules or deeds of the scheme. In my view, it is within that framework, rather than through the State’s industrial relations machinery, that a collective approach would be most effective. In terms of changes to pension schemes generally, the trustees of a particular pension scheme are required by law to act in the best interests of all the members, be they deferred members or pensioner members. Until recently, this has been done on an individual basis. The Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection has recently provided for the recognition by trustees and the Pensions Authority of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a particular pension scheme. The required revised section 50 guidance has been published by the Pensions Authority. From now on, the trustees of a pension scheme are required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme with regard to such proposals. In addition, the Pensions Authority is now required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes either to issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative groups an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in respect of such proposals. Furthermore, in such situations, the representative group also will have the option of making an appeal to the High Court on a point of law regarding such proposals.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	That is not adequate at all. The reason this difficulty has arisen is that, under existing procedures, trustees already must inform everybody. Notifying people of something is not the same as engaging or negotiating with them. This is the difficulty. I will use the example of the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme, IASS, because it highlights well the point being made in this regard. At the heart of this issue, existing and deferred pensioners stood to lose an enormous chunk of the income to which they had a reasonable expectation on retirement, based on having paid into a pension for all their working lives. The retired members have made the point that €500,000 per month is being taken out of the local economy in cuts to that group alone. The people who made that decision were existing employees, trade unions, the trustees and everyone on the expert panel. The people who voted on that decision were members of trade unions in employment who were not even members of that pension scheme. The very people whose pockets have been pilfered of this money did not have a voice at the table and did not have an input into the process. I did not hear anything in the Minister of State's reply that tells me they will have a input in the future either. It simply is not good enough to suggest that someone should go to the courts or whatever when people are retired and have limited income anyway. I wish to hear in concrete terms what is going to be done about this.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	The Tánaiste and I are anxious to seek to address this issue, and she and I are familiar with the circumstances Deputy Clare Daly has outlined. It was felt that the appropriate way to address concerns in the future would be through the Pensions Authority, where people would be provided with the opportunity to make submissions to the authority in the type of circumstances outlined by Deputy Daly. Previously, the views of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court were canvassed as to the possibility of using the industrial relations institutions of the State to address some of these issues. They responded with a couple of fundamental points. The view was taken, on foot of meetings between officials from the Departments of Social Protection and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, that it was clear that the solution to addressing the concerns of retired and deferred members of pension schemes with regard to representation rights might best be achieved in the context of the pensions legislative framework. The Tánaiste has made provisions for this in terms of the details I outlined earlier. In future, this will be done through a process with the Pensions Authority rather than in the industrial relations arena.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I am afraid I do not agree. Sadly, if we do not change tack, I imagine I will be proven right. There are problems with the Pensions Authority and with trustees taking decisions that members are not happy with, and there is a problem with having an appropriate investigation into some of the activities. The difficulty is that we are talking about people's retirement in their twilight years. It is very serious considering the sums of money involved. I do not understand why the Labour Court could not be opened up to people just as a trade union can negotiate therein for its members although some of the employees under discussion may not be in that trade union. Retiree groups such as the Retired Aviation Staff Association and other registered retired groups could do the same for pensioner groups. It is about having their voice heard on an ongoing process. I refer to circumstances where a company may be involved in broader discussions on issues other from pension-related issues and where the discussions become part of an industrial relations discussion also. There has to be a voice for those concerned in this regard. There would have to be a complete overhaul of the Pensions Authority, which people feel does not have any teeth in terms of delivering justice for people who have legitimate concerns. The IASS is a very good example of that in that, despite serious questions of investment irregularity having been raised, a decision was taken to allow pensioners' incomes to be cut rather than answer some of the points.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	Deputy Daly raised a couple of fundamental points on the industrial relations machinery of the State. Access to the industrial relations machinery of the State is governed by the definition of “worker” in section 23 of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, which provides, inter alia, that a “worker” means any person aged 15 years or more who has entered into or works under a contract with an employer. Legal advice received by the Labour Court on a number of occasions suggests that a person who is retired cannot be regarded as a worker and cannot be party to a trade dispute capable of investigation by the court. Where a person is retired, he or she cannot have a dispute concerning his or her employment or non-employment. The court is, however, entitled to investigate a matter that arose prior to an individual’s retirement and which was referred to the Labour Relations Commission or Labour Court prior to the individual’s retirement. The introduction of access rights for individual retired workers to the industrial relations machinery of the State under the industrial relations Acts where they have not referred their claim prior to retirement is currently under consideration. However, with regard to the very important pensions piece, a decision has been taken that the Pensions Authority represents the appropriate mechanism by which the issues can be explored. As I stated, an opportunity would be provided to people in certain circumstances where fundamental changes were being made to their scheme. They would be provided with the opportunity to make submissions to the Pensions Authority where those issues were being considered.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	In view of the very significant level of unemployment in County Tipperary, which is much higher than the national average, and the fact that the county is not getting its fair share of foreign direct investment, I ask the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, to provide a list of sites available for of inward investment in the county.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I am informed by IDA Ireland that it owns two land banks in County Tipperary with potential for use for inward investment in the future. One of these is located in Ballingarrane, Clonmel, and consists of approximately 20 hectares, or 49 acres, while in Tipperary town there is a site of approximately 3 hectares, or 7.42 acres, available. I am informed by IDA Ireland that pending the securing of a suitable investment for these locations, the lands are rented by the agency on a short-term basis. I understand from IDA Ireland that it is working to ensure each region has office and manufacturing buildings, other buildings and greenfield sites available to potential foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland clients or other appropriate job-creating enterprises and will work with local authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure in each region. South Tipperary is located in IDA Ireland’s south-east region along with counties Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny and Carlow, while North Tipperary is located in IDA Ireland’s mid-west region along with counties Limerick and Clare.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I thank the Minister. No matter what way the Minister looks at this and no matter what he says, the fact of the matter is that the creation of 64 jobs in County Tipperary in 2014, when IDA Ireland created 15,012 nationally, means the county has been abandoned by the Government. It is not getting its fair share of inward investment and that is the reason I have tabled a series of questions on this today. It is quite clear that the Minister's announcement yesterday worsens the situation and disadvantages the county and its towns to a much greater extent. It excludes those towns from the programme of building manufacturing and office facilities. This is occurring in nine towns throughout the country, but not in a single town in County Tipperary. What does the Minister intend to do to create jobs in the towns of County Tipperary? Will he amend the regional strategy to include those towns?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	First, the Deputy needs to understand the Government does not allocate enterprises or jobs to counties, towns or regions. Enterprises make decisions. To improve the attractiveness of certain regions, additional supports can be made available by IDA Ireland. In the south east and mid-west, additional support is provided by IDA Ireland to enterprises that wish to locate there. The supports are actively marketed as an additional incentive beyond some of the stronger areas. In addition, we have made a decision that there will be, in the next three years, advance facilities in each of the six regions. Those have been selected by IDA Ireland based on their ability to attract and be a magnet for the region. Approximately 30% of the money that IDA Ireland is providing for property solutions will be for the nine facilities. Some 70% of the additional money for property will be available throughout the country on foot of strategic decisions to strengthen business parks, provide strategic sites, etc. Every region has an opportunity. I ask the Deputy to regard the regional strategy as an opportunity for the region to develop new enterprises and make the county and region attractive. We are seeking to bring forward the best ideas to build on the strengths of the region. The Deputy's region has many strengths on which we seek to build. This is not a story of neglect but of an opportunity being offered to the Deputy and his region. We hope the region will take up that opportunity.

The Minister has certainly make decisions and choices but those he has made have excluded every town in County Tipperary from the regional strategy. As I stated, those towns have significant levels of unemployment. The unemployment rate in Carrick-on-Suir is double the national average. There is no site or advance factory there. In Nenagh and Roscrea, there are sites but no advance factories, and there are no proposals for the latter. The same applies to Thurles and Tipperary town. The Government needs to ensure County Tipperary is not forgotten and, specifically, that the building of advance factories in the county is undertaken immediately.

I am long enough in this House to recall when decisions were made in the way the Deputy talks about, whereby buildings would be pushed up in wildernesses and stand there as white elephants because of the waste of public money. What is happening now is that IDA Ireland is making strategic decisions. It will support opportunities in every single county and region. Some 80% of the money is still available for people with strong ideas for developing their enterprises. Enterprise is not about politicians moving pawns around on the board; that is not the way jobs are built.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	All of our agencies have policies in place to encourage greater levels of research and innovation and to build the innovation capacity of our enterprises. Enterprise Ireland directly supports companies which engage in innovation, with instruments designed to support companies at different levels of engagement in innovation. IDA Ireland also has a suite of supports for client companies which invest in research and has been successful in attracting new research and development activities to Ireland. Both IDA Ireland and EI collaborate in the establishment of clusters of companies to engage in innovation through technology centres. Nine new technology centres have been established under this Government, the most recent of which was launched last week in dairy processing where huge opportunities exist for Ireland. Science Foundation Ireland is a major funder of enterprise-focused research. Through research prioritisation it has ensured that investment is made where Ireland has the capacity build competitive advantage. Its flagship investment in 12 world-class research centres has made industry partnership a prerequisite for success. A major focus of all the efforts of State agencies has been to increase the impact of investment in research on job creation. To this end, Knowledge Transfer Ireland was established in 2013. It has built upon the new IP protocol by taking initiatives to increase the uptake in terms of licences and spin-outs. The opportunity for successful commercialisation is supported by EI programmes for high potential start-ups and by the commercialisation fund. These policies are having an impact. The levels of business expenditure on research and development has increased from €1.86 billion in 2011 to an estimated €2.09 billion in 2013, and approximately 300 companies have committed €200 million towards SFI's 12 research centres. Collaborations between industry and researchers continue to grow and now involve more than 2,200 enterprises. Overall the number of research active enterprises is steadily growing.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	I endorse the Minister of State's remarks about SFI. It is doing a superb job and its research centres are excellent. To drill down into those statistics the Minister of State quoted, foreign-owned enterprises are responsible for 70% of research and development expenditure in the country. That means Irish indigenous companies are far behind the curve when it comes to research and development expenditure. Almost three quarters of the total expenditure on in-house research and development was by companies with more than 50 employees. Some of the work that SFI is doing with small companies is excellent. No doubt small companies are the nucleus of much amazing research and development work, but either we are not engaging with traditional small companies directly to get them onto this agenda or we are failing in bringing the benefits of Horizon 2020 and the research and development programme to SMEs. What kind of partnerships would the Minister of State envisage for organisations, such as the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, the Small Firms Association and, in particular, the local enterprise offices, to bring them to the stage where research and development is the future? We have had a lot of regional discussion here this morning. Perhaps there are companies in that county or some of those towns which could be getting involved in research and development to create employment.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	There is a range of different activities going on at present. One company that I am particularly knowledgeable about is called Combilift. It is an amazingly successful company that is dedicated to the area of research and innovation, and the benefits of that have really borne fruit with its major jobs announcement last week. Three quarters of research and development active companies are our own SMEs, many of which are exporting and are encouraged and supported by Enterprise Ireland and - progressively so - by the local enterprise offices to engage in research and innovation. There are, through Enterprise Ireland, progressive options for participation. There are opportunities to obtain research and development vouchers, innovation vouchers and grants and to develop partnerships as well with third level institutions and other actors in that space. From travelling around the country and talking to people in local enterprise offices, it is my experience that their growing connections with third level institutes of technology and universities will be increasingly important in ensuring that our SMEs can occupy that research and development space. Deputy Calleary will be familiar with all of that. Good work has been undertaken by this Government and the previous Government in the research and development space. It is an area in which we have invested considerably in recent years and we now can see the benefits of that.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	Combilift is a fantastic company. There is a range of companies in the north east - they seem to be an innovative lot up there - but we should be looking for the next Combilift or McHale Engineering. This is the chance, with the extra resources allocated to Horizon 2020. I would urge the Minister of State to push the LEOs harder in this space because these offices have the business organisations on the ground and they have the potential to spot who will produce the next Combilift.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	Our agencies, such as IDA Ireland, are involved in pilot mid-tier programmes to bring small and medium-sized companies up to the level that we all want them to be at. There is a lot of activity in that space. There has been significant investment ring-fenced by Government around research and development, even during difficult times, because we could see the benefits of State investment. I have had the opportunity to participate in a number of trade missions over recent months. One aspect for which we are renowned in this country is our work in the area of innovation, and that is what the Irish SME sector can bring to foreign companies abroad. Our SMEs are strong on that sense of innovation in bringing added value to products that they may have developed, and they will continue to do that. We are focused as a Government in supporting our SMEs to grow, and the best way to do that is through investment in research and development.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	The Government has made a range of financial supports available to Irish SMEs to support growth and job creation in the economy. These include seed and venture capital schemes, development capital schemes, the innovation fund, Microfinance Ireland, the credit guarantee scheme and three funds put in place by the National Pensions Reserve Fund. In addition, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has now been established. All of these schemes are designed to broaden the options available to SMEs beyond the traditional banking system. I can report on the progress of those operated by agencies of my Department. As of 31 December 2014, the credit guarantee scheme has 120 live facilities and 14 repaid facilities resulting in €16 million being sanctioned through the scheme by the participating lenders resulting in 649 new jobs being created and 333 jobs being maintained. As of 31 December 2014, Microfinance Ireland has approved 413 applications to the value of €6.31 million supporting 891 jobs. I am actively reviewing and improving both schemes and will be taking the necessary legislative steps to deliver changes to both. The development capital fund has now seen the successful launch of three new funds. In total, these funds have €491 million under management with a strategy of investing in Irish companies, and they are actively seeking investment opportunities. I understand that approximately €60 million from these funds has been invested. These investments will see the creation of new jobs over time. In 2013, Enterprise Ireland-supported seed and venture capital schemes made 153 investments in Irish-based companies with a total investment value of €59 million. Companies supported by the programme over the past five years have created more than 2,100 jobs in Ireland. These seed and venture capital schemes have been a successful funding vehicle and a new round of funding has been launched. Under the new seed and venture scheme for 2013 to 2018 Enterprise Ireland is committing a total of €100 million to funds under this scheme which it is hoped will be matched by at least €300 million of private funding. To date, one new fund, Fountain Healthcare Partners Fund II, has reached its funding targets and has been formally announced. In total, this fund currently has €87.5 million under management and is actively seeking new investments. The remainder of funds will be announced when the fund managers reach their funding targets. I look forward to making further announcements in the near term.

I appreciate it. The debt that is experienced by enterprise in the State and the access to finance still form one of the major impediments to growth. It is the brake on growth in a significant section of enterprise. Right through the four years, this has been an issue, and most of the initiatives that the Government has taken have failed miserably in terms of the level of impact and engagement. I encourage the Minister to ensure that the necessary efforts, especially with microfinance and the credit guarantee scheme, are made in order that they gain traction.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22614	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	I agree that access to finance is vital to the growth of the economy, but it is worth observing that the reported refusal rate of banks has more than halved, down from 30% to 14%. Applicants appeal decisions to the Credit Review Office, CRO. Between the CRO and the banks, 70% of decisions are being overturned where applicants challenge them. That is important for applicants.Between all the non-banking facilities, we have more than €3 billion available for SMEs. There is a suite of options alternative to the banks and we keep developing those. The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is a new entity this year. I hope it will bring in new entrants but also that it will make new types of product available to SMEs to meet the needs of the growing companies about which the Deputy is concerned. We are acutely aware that this a priority, and we will bring forward further proposals.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, which was initiated in the Seanad, to this House. The primary purpose of the Bill is to introduce measures that will enable the Commissioner of Valuation to accelerate the national programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties across the State. The Bill makes important changes to the Valuation Act 2001 which will update the legislation in light of the experience of the operation of the Bill since its commencement in 2002. The Bill also extends exemptions from rates to not-for-profit child care providers and community sports clubs. The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and, while Deputies can legitimately say it has taken a long time to reach this stage, significant work was done at official level, in consultation with industry stakeholders, and in the Seanad, to iron out issues in what is quite a technical piece of legislation. The issues raised on Second Stage in the Seanad were worked on by officials in consultation with stakeholders and resulted in a large number of Committee Stage amendments. We had a very good Committee Stage in Seanad Éireann. I wish to acknowledge the input of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, which is the main representative body for the valuation surveying profession, and other stakeholders. This work was built on during the Seanad debate on the Committee Stage amendments, which led to further refinements on Report Stage. The Bill was rigorously tested in the three Committee Stage sessions in the Seanad and all sides agreed that the Bill as passed by the Seanad is an improved piece of legislation that took on board the input of both stakeholders and members of the Seanad. I acknowledge their constructive input to the legislation. The existing valuation legislation is primarily contained in the Valuation Act 2001, which provides for the valuation of all fixed property, including land and buildings. Valued also is incorporeal property, defined as property with no physical existence, such as tolls, easements, fishery rights and other rights over property. The commercial and industrial sectors effectively constitute the rateable valuation base. The Valuation Office has responsibility for implementing and maintaining the valuation system. As Members are aware, it is the value assigned to a property by the Valuation Office multiplied by the annual rate on valuation, set by the local authority at its budgetary meeting each year, which determines the rates amount due from individual occupiers. Could I ask whether the script has been circulated? I ask my officials to arrange for the script to be circulated. We will make those arrangements now. I apologise to the House.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	My apologies. We have a copy available now. This legislation is concerned with the valuation of property for rates purposes but not with the setting or collection of rates. The basis of assessment for valuation purposes is the net annual value of a property. The net annual value of a property is equivalent to the annual rent, exclusive of all payments in respect of rates, taxes, repairs and insurance, which a property could reasonably be expected to command. The rateable occupier, the person who has to pay the rates, is the person in the immediate use and enjoyment of the property, usually a tenant or an owner occupier. The national revaluation programme, which was provided for in the Valuation Act 2001 and which commenced in the greater Dublin area in 2005, is the first general valuation since the middle of the 19th century, and is a significant undertaking involving some 146,000 properties. The Valuation Act 2001 provides that valuation be carried out on a rolling basis. This means that each rating authority area will be separately valued as part of a planned sequential valuation of the whole country. The sequence is decided by the Commissioner of Valuation, who is independent in carrying out his function. A key motivation for introducing the amending legislation is to expedite the national revaluation programme of commercial and industrial properties. Revaluation is all about rebalancing the overall rates burden in each local authority area, and I am conscious that there is pressure for the work to proceed at a more brisk pace. As stated, valuations are based on rental values. If there is to be a fair distribution of the rates burden, then valuation should be based on modern rental values and not those that were used as the basis of valuations 25 or more years ago. Completion of a revaluation in a rating authority area will help to address some of the issues that arise in relation to the rates system. Rates are a charge levied annually on commercial property and are a necessary and stable source of funding for local authorities. Since a revaluation seeks to address movements in the relative values of property over time, a revaluation will offer respite to those that may have an unduly high rates bill for historical reasons. At a more aggregate level one could, in some cases, see a shift in the rates burden from a town centre to a new out-of-town retail facility. Where that occurs, revaluation may contribute positively to making town centres more attractive to prospective businesses. Revaluation is a very important element in achieving correctness, equity and uniformity of valuations within a given local authority area, as it is the means through which changes in economic circumstances since the last revaluation are taken into account. Revaluations will be on a cycle once the first one is completed in a rating authority area, and each revaluation will be completed not less than five years and not more than ten years after the previous revaluation. Completing the first revaluation and getting all rating authorities on to the five-to-ten-year cycle will constitute a significant positive change to the valuation and rating system. Although considerable progress has been made in recent years, there is still much that needs to be done. The present position is that, following the completion of revaluation in the four local authority areas in Dublin, the three former local authorities in Waterford and Limerick, more than 48,000 properties have been revalued. While that represents more than 33% of all rateable properties, it constitutes approximately 57% of the valuation base for levying rates. The revaluation programme needs to move at a faster pace to bring the benefits of a modern valuation base to the rates system. In 2001, when the previous piece of legislation was being introduced, the expectation was that the complete revaluation of all commercial property would take ten years to complete. This assumption has proved over time to be wide of the mark and hugely optimistic. The current target for the completion of the revaluation programme is 2018. Revaluations completed to date show that approximately 58% of properties will see a reduction in their rates bill and approximately 38% will see an increase, while the remainder are properties with no change or that are being rated for the first time. Generally speaking, and depending on the property category, use and location, of those that see a change in their rates liability, approximately three quarters see either a reduction or an increase of less than 40%. Some have seen very significant increases or decreases, but these have been examined and have occurred for good reason, sometimes because they should have been the subject of a revision of their valuation some time before the revaluation exercise took place. As outlined, there are many positive reasons for having a rolling revaluation programme. The Bill seeks to introduce a number of measures to speed up the process and includes allowing elements of the work to be outsourced, the employment of computer-based methodologies and more participative involvement of the occupier in valuing property through a process that is referred to in the Bill as occupier-assisted valuation. I am proposing to make enabling provisions that would allow the commissioner to assign valuation work to valuers who are not officers of the Valuation Office. Currently, the commissioner can only assign valuation work to a member of his or her staff. This amendment will allow the commissioner to engage with the private sector directly through a tendering process. This would augment the internal capacity of the Valuation Office, increase the resources devoted to the revaluation programme and accelerate the delivery of the revaluation project. The commissioner intends to carry out a pilot project involving the use of external valuation providers. This is an innovative advance and presents a unique opportunity for a first public-private sector engagement in this area of the public service. To complement these initiatives, there is provision to enable the Commissioner of Valuation to use general market data, or aggregated data, including statistical and computer-aided techniques, to assist in estimating the net annual values of groups, classes or categories of properties, where appropriate.The use of computer-aided techniques is commonplace in other jurisdictions. It adds to the efficiency of valuation determination and also contributes to the accuracy and equity of revaluations. This is now provided for in section 5 of the Bill, amending section 13 of the current Act. A demonstration from an outsider's perspective of what technology can add to the system can be seen by using the detailed online map of all valuations available on the Valuation Office website. I am also proposing to make enabling provisions in the Bill to give the commissioner capacity to introduce an occupier assisted valuation option for the valuation of commercial property. Initially, this would be done in one local authority area on a pilot basis. Section 12 of the Bill provides for the insertion of a new Part 5A dealing with occupier assisted valuation. Provision is made for the Minister to make regulations on the operation of occupier assisted valuation. In practical terms, this process will involve a more participative approach between the Valuation Office and the occupier than exists with direct valuation. The occupier will be engaged at a very early part of the process. Guidance will be available to the occupier on the measurement of his or her premises, together with indicative valuation levels for the area in which the property is located. The occupier will return his or her valuation and valuations returned will be subject to a check by the Valuation Office. If the Valuation Office decides to change the valuation returned, the occupier will, as in all other situations, be able to make representations to the Valuation Office and appeal a decision to the Valuation Tribunal. The process will be more transparent to the occupier and bring a greater involvement and understanding of how the valuation is arrived at, which should demonstrate the efforts made to arrive at a correct, equitable and uniform valuation for all properties in the rating authority area. The progress made to date in Dublin, Waterford and Limerick, the experience gained in those revaluations and the measures in this Bill provide the platform for an accelerated completion of the revaluation of the remaining local authorities. The Bill updates the valuation code to accord with modern conditions. The Bill corrects several identified deficiencies in the current legislative framework based on the practical experience of the Valuation Office, the Society of Chartered Surveyors and other stakeholders working with the current legislation over the past decade or so. The Bill aims to streamline aspects of the current appeals process. This will also help to accelerate the pace at which the national revaluation programme is proceeding while ensuring in-depth engagement between the ratepayer and the Valuation Office in fixing the net annual value of a property. The Bill will retain the right of appeal to the tribunal where ratepayers are dissatisfied with a valuation and to the High Court on a point of law. Under the current legislation, the ratepayer has the right to make representations at revision and revaluation stage to the Valuation Office in regard to the proposed valuation. This was a new feature of the valuation process introduced under the 2001 Act. It is, in effect, a first-instance appeal for which no fee is payable. In addition, the traditional right of appeal to the commissioner against the decision of the revision officer was then retained, as was the right of further appeal to the Valuation Tribunal. This process affords the ratepayer three opportunities to contest a valuation assessment. There is also a right of appeal to the High Court on a point of law. In the modern context, streamlining this process is essential. It will allow the commissioner to deploy resources most efficiently in revising and revaluing properties on an ongoing basis. My officials have examined comparable appeal systems in other jurisdictions and have found that, in general, there are no more than two opportunities to appeal or raise an objection to a valuation assessment, while our current system provides three opportunities to appeal or raise an objection to a valuation. The existing additional right of appeal to the higher courts on a point of law will remain. The comprehensive consideration of submissions made by ratepayers at the representation phase, which was introduced by the 2001 Act and the right to raise issues of rateability or quantum at tribunal stage, has convinced me that the right of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation could be safely disposed of without unduly diminishing the rights of occupiers of property. Section 16 of the Bill proposes to remove this appeal stage. The Bill also provides in sections 11 and 14 for an extended period, from 28 days to 40 days, to make representations to the Valuation Office before the final valuation certificate is issued. Once the final certificate is issued, there is a right to appeal the decision to the independent Valuation Tribunal. As with all such appeals, a point of law can subsequently be appealed to the courts. Thus, the rights of ratepayers to due process is amply catered for in this legislation. The extended period of time in which to make representations will be welcomed by the business community. Section 7 clarifies the criteria to be used in determining values when a revaluation is undertaken. It gives an equal weighting to correctness of value, equity and uniformity, thus codifying an important recent judgment of the High Court, by Ms Justice O'Malley, on the interpretation of the 2001 Act. Henceforth, these criteria will now be used by appellants in grounding their appeals and by the tribunal in considering such appeals following a revaluation. These provisions were the subject of much debate both in the Seanad and during a comprehensive engagement with stakeholders. An avoidance of doubt amendment to section 19 of the Bill, introduced on Report Stage in the Seanad, was widely welcomed by Senators on all sides of the House and by stakeholders, as a resolution to remaining concerns around the future interpretation of these provisions. I bring the Bill to this House in a better state as a result of that Report Stage amendment. Section 15 of the Bill introduces a new provision to equip the commissioner with additional authority to address anomalies on the valuation list. This is an important provision. This amendment is to provide for exceptional circumstances where a decision by the revision manager not to change a valuation would otherwise lead to inequity and a lack or diminution of uniformity of value between certain properties in the same rating authority area. This might include a situation where there has been no material change of circumstances to justify a revision under section 28. The example often cited is where a service station has been bypassed by a motorway but no material change of circumstances, as defined in the legislation, technically exists which would bring about a revision and consequential reduction of the valuation level and there is no existing statutory power to address the problem. In such exceptional cases, the commissioner will have discretionary powers to direct a revision manager to amend the valuation of a property which he or she considers to be inaccurate. The commissioner will no longer have to rely on determinations of the Valuation Tribunal or the higher courts to address such anomalies. The new section 29A replaces section 40 of the Act which is proposed to be repealed by section 21 of the Bill. I wish to take this opportunity to emphasise that the purpose of this new provision is to address exceptional individual anomalies without setting aside the material change of circumstances provisions which have prevailed since the 2001 Act was implemented. I will outline the new exemptions provided in the Bill. Section 38 of the Bill introduces exemptions for two categories of properties - property used for not-for-profit child care and community sport. A very conservative approach has been taken to the extension of exemption from rates to any grouping. Commercial rates are a key part of local government funding and if local government funding is to be maintained, then it is the remaining ratepayers who pick up the tab where a class of property is exempt. Hence, the conservative nature of the provision for exemptions I have adopted in this Bill. Any unjustified extension of exemption is very unfair on existing ratepayers who must pick up the burden. New exemptions also create precedents and raise expectations of further exemptions. Any extension of exemptions has to respect the importance of the ratings system to local government funding and the established valuation and rating principles that have been developed over a long period of time. The proposed community sport exemption resolves an anomaly that exists where if a club has a bar, all of its premises become rateable. This issue is of concern to Deputies on all sides of the House and on which we had extensive discussions in the Seanad. As a result of consultation with the Opposition and with stakeholders, we have a better provision than in the original Bill. I thank Members for that constructive engagement. The proposed change improves the legislation by granting an explicit exemption to community sport facilities and resolves a long-standing anomaly. The extension of the exemption to not-for-profit child care will bring a consistency of approach to a subset of the child care sector while respecting the principle that those who operate with the intention of making a profit remain rateable. While I have covered the main changes in the Bill, provision is made for other proposals, many of which are of a technical nature. Section 2 introduces or amends a number of definitions, including defining the regional fisheries board - now Inland Fisheries Ireland - as a rating authority so as to allow for its revaluation and which is not possible under the 2001 Act. The linking of the definition of "charitable organisation" to that set out in the Charities Act 2009, and amending the definition of material change of circumstances to provide that a change in the licensed status of a premises, will qualify a property for a revision of its valuation. Sections 7 and 13 outline the position of the Commissioner of Valuation in relation to maintaining correctness, equity and uniformity in the valuation list. Section 7 sets out technical amendments relating to valuation orders. Section 10 will enable the correction of clerical errors in the revaluation list without the parties needing to go through the revision process. This is a common-sense provision. Based on practical experience, section 11 augments the provision governing the revaluation representation phase, including making allowance for events that impact on a valuation such as the subdivision of a property or the amalgamation of two properties.Section 17 will prevent a person from using information they failed to provide in response to a formal notice to ground or support an appeal. Section 26 amends the definition of "net annual value" to return it to its original intended meaning. Section 27 provides for an adjustment to the valuation of a property, if determined using the contractor’s method, to better ensure that the valuation satisfies the objective of being correct, equitable and uniform. Section 28 addresses anomalies within the current legislative system which provides for the global valuation of public utility undertakings. Section 36 will provide for data sharing to improve the efficiency of the valuation process. Section 37 will give greater flexibility and operational efficiency to the Valuation Tribunal by allowing for an individual member of the tribunal to consider an appeal - at present a division must be comprised of three members - and will provide for the consideration of an appeal on the written submissions received without the need for an oral hearing. Other technical amendments on valuing properties, separating the publication date of valuation lists and the date on which they become effective, consequential changes to the rates limitation order provision and amendments to the definition of "plant" are provided for in sections 6, 8, 9, 30 and 39. There are also transitional provisions to cater for cases that will be in the system when the Bill is enacted. The basic principle is that if any substantial decision has been taken under the existing legislation then the existing legislation will apply until that case is concluded. Unrelated to valuation, section 31 of the Bill provides for a new Part 12A which removes any doubt about property transferring from the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This was provided for in secondary legislation but it was advised, to avoid any doubt about the transfer of a limited category of properties, that a provision in primary legislation should be made. I am using this legislation as an opportunity to do so. This is important legislation. Its provisions will facilitate the acceleration of the national revaluation programme, something which has been long overdue and which has been a matter of priority for the Government. It updates the legislation to provide for deficiencies identified through practical experience. It provides for efficiencies in the appeals process and in the operation of the Valuation Tribunal itself, and it makes minor extensions to exemptions from rates which correct anomalies and bring greater equity to small subsets of the commercial rates base. I commend the Bill to the House.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	The Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss the rateable valuation system which operates in Ireland. It is a perfect opportunity to see not only whether the legislation is good but whether the system is fit for purpose. Yesterday afternoon we dealt with Revised Estimates with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, including Revised Estimates for the Valuation Office, and as this Bill was scheduled for discussion today I asked a few questions and said I would raise the issues again today. In reply to a parliamentary question yesterday, the Minister stated this is the first general revaluation of all commercial properties since the middle of the 19th century and progress is being made. I suggest progress is not being made. Commercial rates are part of a three-legged stool which existed in the 19th century, along with agricultural rates, which were found to be unconstitutional, and domestic rates, which were abolished 40 years ago, before the Minister of State was even born.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	True.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	Commercial rates are an old legacy from the 19th century and they are still here. This says quite a bit. I do not believe for a minute the Revenue Commissioners, who deal with general taxation and the collection of taxes, could operate a system based on the 19th century. We must look at the entire valuation system, commercial rates and the Valuation Office in this regard. The Government pays lip service to this topic when it is asked about it but then ignores it on every other occasion. Nothing proves this more than the fact the Bill was published on 1 August 2012 and more than two and a half years later it is making its first appearance in the Dáil. This is the Government's commitment to dealing with commercial rates. I know it went to the Seanad last year, but it is still two and a half years later. If I were running the Valuation Office and I knew legislation would not see the light of day in the Dáil Chamber for at least two and a half years I would be in no rush to get on with revaluations throughout the country because the Government is in no rush to deal with it. The Government's attitude has set the tone for the lack of activity in the Valuation Office, and in doing so has undermined the entire existence of the valuation system we have at present. Imagine the mess we would have if the Revenue Commissioners did not have an online system and people could not pay their taxes online. One cannot pay commercial rates online. I checked my local authority's website this morning, and one can pay online for practically everything a local authority does except commercial rates. I am not asking the Minister of State to change this, because the system is so broken that a little tinkering with the system is not the issue, but it is symptomatic. One can pay online every sort of a fine, waste management bills and almost anything else one likes to a local authority because they have become very efficient, but the system does not allow online payment for commercial rates. It is indicative of the fact this system has been left in the backwoods since the 19th century. In 2001 legislation was published to commence the revaluation process. The briefing document I received yesterday contains the exact figures, and the Minister of State has just said 33% of the 146,000 properties have been revalued since the introduction of the 2001 legislation. He stated the in excess of 33% of all rateable properties which have been revalued constitutes approximately 57% of the valuation base. After 14 years only one third of the properties has been revalued, and the Minister of State has said today the other two thirds will be done in the next three years. This is not credible based on past experience. One might say the process was commenced in 2005 as opposed to 2001, but this would mean that after nine years only one third has been completed. Not at all will two thirds be done in the next few years. I oppose everything to do with the Bill on Second Stage and I will table a series of amendments on Committee Stage, because this is not the legislation required to deal with commercial rates. The legislation contains a few little patches and band aids for technical faults which have been found in the system and issues causing problems, but even if this legislation was introduced and worked perfectly it would be working in a system which should not exist. There needs to be a new system from scratch for commercial rates, which are a business tax and must be done in a business-like manner. I find it incredible that since 2005 only one third of the buildings has been revalued. It is testament for winding up the Valuation Office. The Government has agreed to this and I will come to Tailte Éireann which will be created through the amalgamation of Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority. I do not know the reasoning behind it. Perhaps it makes sense. Within it is an opportunity to have a proper commercial rates valuation system. The commercial rates system should be in line with all other taxation systems in Ireland. Income tax is self-assessed, as is corporation tax. People fill out their accounts and send in the amount owed, subject to audit and stringent penalties and arrears if they are found not to make proper returns. The Revenue Commissioners have great methods within their systems to see whether what is received from an industry is valid, and they will spot the exceptions and know where to go. Capital taxes are self-assessed; one fills in a capital gains tax form or a capital acquisitions tax form, and the executor of an estate does the valuation for inheritance tax. The new local property tax is self-assessed, and if we have self-assessment for 1.5 million houses we should be able to have self-assessment for 146,000 commercial properties.We should bear in mind that people who are in commercial properties and businesses would have a better way of knowing how to do a self-assessment than many householders, who would never have been asked to do something like that in regard to local property tax. I asked the Minister of State a question about self-assessment in the House yesterday morning. He has provided for an enabling provision to allow one county to be selected for a pilot scheme. A period of two or three years would be allowed for the pilot scheme, then a year to assess it and then we might move on to two counties at that stage. That enabling provision to allow one county to do a pilot scheme is all that is provided for, and that was probably indicated yesterday at the committee. In response to a question I asked the Minister of Sate about self-assessment yesterday, he replied that this requires the application of a uniform approach and that it was much more complex than the self-assessment of local property tax, which has been successful but which cannot be replicated in this situation. The people who wrote the Minister of State's script yesterday said the issue was too complex and that he could not go there, but I am surprised that he bought that line. He probably did not have time to read it. Of course everything is complex; that is why we are here. If it was simple, we would not even have to talk about it. The Minister of State's reply was that we could value all houses through self-assessment, but it is too complex to do that for a business. However, the reverse is the case; a business should be more capable of self-assessment. The fact that it is complex is no excuse for not doing it. However, I do not even believe it is complex. That was a fob-off in the reply I got yesterday. The Minister of State spoke about the provision allowing owner-assisted valuation, and it was confirmed yesterday that this would apply only to one local authority area, as indicated in the briefing notes. I challenge everything about this legislation. There is no reason this item of business taxation should be so separate from every other taxation method, but it is probably because it is a 19th century system drawn up by the Valuation Office. Rates are struck by the local authority, and the system has escaped proper examination. I am not saying that the levying or collecting of it should go to the Revenue Commissioners, although that is something we may come to consider, as it might be more efficient, although it might not be. The main reason I have a reservation about it is what the Government did with the Local Government Fund - it took money collected through local property taxes and motor taxation for local government and is now giving 30% of it to Irish Water. If I could be sure the money collected by the Revenue Commissioners under a rateable system would go back in an efficient manner to the local authorities, that would be worth considering, but currently the Government could not be trusted to do that because it would probably end up giving some of it to Irish Water, saying that businesses use water, and while it would acknowledge that businesses pay rates, it would charge them this as well.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	They already pay water charges.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	They already pay for water, and the public will pay for water, but the motor tax revenue will go to Irish Water as a subvention. That was last week's issue, but I am raising it again today. All other taxes - I mentioned some of the main ones - are related to levels of business activity. If one's turnover goes up one's VAT goes up, and if one's turnover goes down one's VAT goes down. If a business goes up its excise duties go up, and they go down if the business goes down. If a business is doing well and takes on more employees, it will have bigger PAYE, PRSI and universal social charge bills to pay. If a business is not doing well and has fewer employees, its taxation costs go down. That applies to all taxes - income tax, corporation tax and capital tax - and also to self-assessment, while the other taxes that are collected from businesses, namely VAT, excise duties and payroll taxes, are all related to the level of business activity. However, this is a fixed charge, and it is the only one I can think of, although there might be a few more. The Minister of State might say that motor tax is a fixed charge, but one can change one's car if one wants to pay a lower motor tax rate; one does not have that option if one is trying to run a business. We need an entire root and branch examination of this area. The Government is setting up Tailte Éireann, the name of the Government body formed by the merger of the Property Registration Authority, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Valuation Office. The extent to which the Government is serious about dealing with that amalgamation of the Valuation Office can be shown by the fact that proposed legislation is on the C list of the legislative programme, which means the heads of the Bill have not yet been agreed. It will not see the light of day in the term of this Government. That is the level of the Government's commitment to streamlining the Valuation Office. If by some mistake that legislation proceeds, the first thing that will happen, as happens in every new State organisation - I might have said this here yesterday - is that the Government will set up a new State board. The Public Appointments Service will be involved and the Minister will appoint the board and an interim chairman. The body will require a new corporate governance procedure and a new chief executive will need to be hired. He will have to hire the people under him and the people under him will spend the next year interviewing people for different positions. Every time a new organisation is set up, there is a corporate governance procedure, new staff take up positions and the former staff who are public servants may not transfer to the new body, in which case they will be redeployed in the public service. That is provided for in the Haddington Road agreement and I am sure it will be provided for in any successor agreement. There is no loss of income or position for anybody in regard to the Valuation Office due to the change in structure, but a further two years will be lost in the process of that change. I do not know how the Minister of State believes that during that period he will get two thirds of the properties in the country valued, when only one third of them could be valued since 2001. It is not credible. This legislation might have some merit, but it is not worth even discussing because the foundation on which it is based has long passed its sell-by date. I want to pick up a point that the Minister of State mentioned in his speech. It was an effort by him to be helpful. He gave the example of a material change of circumstances and he cited the example of a motorway bypass, with which I would agree. It is common sense. However, he did not address the issue involved. He said the commissioner would have discretion, but he does not have to do it.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	He does not have discretion at the moment.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	The Minister of State is giving him discretion. The Valuation Office has often been in court about revaluations in cases in which the legislation has provided that it shall do something, but that does not mean it ends up doing so. It may win or lose a court case. That should be a direction; it should not come down to whether the commissioner feels like doing it. That might never happen. He might choose not to exercise that discretion because, to refer to other documentation from the Estimates meeting yesterday and notes we got, his priority is the national revaluation programme. The key priority of the Valuation Office is to deal with this ongoing programme, which is being rolled out to a few more counties this year. The commissioner - I do not know whether the officer will be male or female - will not want to divert resources away from that programme into revisions, but of course revisions must happen because every time a new planning permission is granted it is sent from the local authority to the Valuation Office advising that this is a new building and a new business and requesting that it be revalued in order that rates can be applied to it. That is the way the system works. The Valuation Office will be very busy getting new businesses into the system and accounting for any changes to structures as a result of planning permissions, dealing with the national revaluation programme and setting up the new organisation. The Minister of State thinks the commissioner will have time for discretion in the few hardship cases that arise, and I would like to agree with him, but there is no basis for saying that. It it is wishful thinking. I would like it to happen, but there is no basis upon which one can have any confidence that it will happen. This is probably the only tax that I can think of for which the bill is determined without reference to the business or the people running it. The Valuation Office has a valuation from years ago. The Minister of State indicated that the five-to-ten-year revaluation period was optimistic. It was a polite way of saying it did not happen. The Valuation Office sets the valuation and then it goes to the local authority. We all understand that system and we think everybody else understands it. When it comes to the annual Estimates process, local authorities can see what they will get from the Local Government Fund and from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for roads, as well as funding from their own resources, and note their level of expenditure.They have to hit a bottom line to balance their books. That figure is calculated by taking what is required to balance the books by the total county valuation of all the properties in the county for commercial purposes, multiplied by an arbitrary mathematical figure to balance the books. In recent years, thankfully, there have been very few increases in the local multiplier by most local authorities. There are two public bodies setting the bill, but there is no recognition of the current business taking place in a business premises. The Valuation Office and local authorities set the rate at the annual estimates meeting. It is the only tax I can think of where a taxpayer is presented with a bill, and is told what to pay whether one likes it, it is appropriate, one can afford it or one is profitable. It is unfair and that system has to be realigned. There may be a simpler way of doing things. I am not offering a solution, but rather a point for discussion. The Valuation Office will tell one that the 146,000 premises around the country which are occupied are, by and large, paying rent. In truth, there is a correlation between the market value of the rent, the rates charge which comes from the Valuation Office and the local government estimates process. Those percentages are fairly well established across the country and are probably fairly uniform within a couple of per cent. A simpler way of doing this would be to take the rent bill of a property into account. If, for example, it is €10,000 a year one would send a cheque of X% of the rates to the county council. That is the true valuation of the property for the business in that year. The figures for the rent bill could be self-assessed or otherwise verified, and a percentage sent to the local authority. I have not suggested starving local authorities of money in anything I have said. If such a system was in place it would beg the question of why one would need a valuation office at all. It may have other responsibilities in respect of national utilities. One can ask whether there is a simpler way of setting rates for ratepayers in a county. That can be done without damaging the overall rates taken in a county. Self-assessment is one possible option. People will tell the Minister of State that would be very complex and not to go there. He is too bright to fall for that. I ask him to consider the proposal in a wider context. I have not said what the percentage should be, but there is an option. We have a proven value for every business in the country. I wish to show the Minister how constricted the Bill is. Under the current valuation system and what is proposed, local authorities which want to help to rejuvenate some of the main streets in their towns cannot do so through the rates system because they are obliged to charge the rates that have been determined. They do not have the option to do otherwise. Some businesses which go bust might end up having rates written off if they are not collectable, but local authorities cannot decide to take half of the legal rate and declare a business as up-to-date, as the current legislation and the Bill do not allow for that. One local authority has had to use great resources and imagination to get around the nonsense we have created in valuation legislation. Laois County Council is a model for other counties, but they should not have to follow it. The legislation should be changed so that this can happen without Laois County Council having to introduce an extraordinary scheme to get around the rigidity that is the commercial rates system. It is a business incentive scheme and is currently available for Portlaoise and Abbeyleix. The Minister of State can learn from this as it is very innovative. It is intended to extend it to Rathdowney, Mountmellick, Portarlington and Mountrath in the near future. It is on the council's website. The aim of the scheme is to encourage the use of vacant commercial premises within a designated area of Portlaoise over a three-year period. The incentive scheme will assist new commercial businesses in setting up in the Main Street area of Portlaoise, which is the traditional retailing, commercial and social heart of the town. With limited resources from the county council's fund, it is implementing the initiative to encourage new businesses to establish in these areas. However, having considered the commercial reality of businesses in Portlaoise, Laois County Council has announced the use of vacant commercial premises in the Main Street area of Portlaoise. The following statement demonstrates how it intends to get around the nonsense of the rates system: "The intent of the scheme is to provide a grant incentive for new businesses to locate in premises that have been vacant for a period exceeding six months and to encourage diversity of retail opportunities within a designated area." The grant is not a rates reduction because the law does not allow that. The council has had to invent a new and unique grants system. The grant can provide the financial assistance that makes it attractive for new business to consider setting up in an area where there are a number of vacant shop units. These premises are at present not yielding any rates for the council, therefore this is of benefit to it. The objectives of the scheme are to promote the development and enhancement of retail floor space in the town centre, enhance the viability of the town centre, support the continued role of the town centre, encourage new businesses to occupy commercial premises or shops that have been vacant over a period of time, encourage diversity of business opportunities within the town, provide limited financial assistance to those businesses through the grant scheme and provide an income for the council and jobs for the town. To be eligible for the scheme a shop must be rated. Premises vacant for more than six months would be eligible for a grant of 75% of the rates bill in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in year three. The maximum number of years allowed would be three. One can see how the scheme would work.  People have to pay the rent, but can fill in an application form from the council and receive a payment from the local authority which is called a grant. It cannot be given legally as a rate reduction, rebate or discount because of the cumbersome legislation. It has had to, therefore, invent a grant scheme. That demonstrates what local authorities have had to do to get around the current legislation. The areas covered by the scheme in Laois are Main Street, Market Square to the roundabout on Bridge Street, Church Avenue, Church Street and Railway Street to the roundabout and Well Road to the junction with James Fintan Lalor Avenue. A map of the area has been published. In terms of the proposed use, the following rules apply: use as a shop as defined under class 1 of the planning and development regulations 2001; office use as per class 2 and 3 of the aforementioned regulations; use for medical or health professional clinics; or use as a crèche, day nursery or day centre. There are exclusions, for good reason. Use is not permitted for the following businesses: takeaways, amusement arcades, head shops, betting offices, nightclubs or public houses, and unwanted jewellery and cash for gold shops. Other businesses are also excluded because too many of them are popping up in the town. The council was very clear about the type of good development it wanted in the town, and it is to be encouraged in that. The new scheme is up and running. In case the Minister of State has any queries or is told it is a complex scheme, I can assure him that a tax clearance certificate will be required as part of the application for the grant, approved applicants must sign up to the payment of rates by standing order and accounts must be paid in full each year. One can see that while the council will collect rates, it is prepared to give something back. It is a pity it could not be done through the rates system. The council is to be commended, but there should have been an easier way to address the issue. The current legislation is forcing councils to do such things. My colleague, Deputy McGuinness, introduced the Local Government (Rates and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill on Friday, 21 November 2014. The Government shot it down and said there were issues with it, but its substance was good. We need to look beyond the nitty-gritty of the problem. The difficulty I have is that much of the discussion on the valuation system is about the tribunal and appeals system. A system will be set up and one will be able to appeal internally. The new appeals system will involve a tribunal. I want to know before we start why we are setting up such a complex appeals system. It makes me wonder why I am in this space. An appeals system should be very simple.If somebody has a problem with tax, that person could go to an appeals commissioner but that office is hardly heard of because the system works. That the appeals system and valuation tribunal is so fundamental proves that the basic system has an issue. The Minister of State can see where I am coming from. I will highlight one or two points in the briefing document we received yesterday in the Estimates meeting. I can point out two elements of which the Minister is not aware. The provision for the Valuation Office was €8.904 million, with the actual expenditure at €6.67 million; it did not even do the job the Oireachtas gave it the money to do. It is not even operating in first gear.

The document we received indicated the hope that the legislation published in 2012 - some two and a half years ago - would have been enacted last year. It is only being introduced now. The Government has missed the boat. It has not even bolted the door after the horse has gone, as it was a bad door and bad stable to start with. The horse is better off out of the stable. This amalgamation issue must be examined. The subheading for this year requests funding for ongoing development of strategic ICT and geographic information systems that are required, pending the amalgamation. There is no timescale on the process but this would be a great way to slow down the system. A figure has been provided for the pilot self-assessment or occupier-assisted valuation scheme but it is only mentioned for one local authority area. There is a simpler way to deal with it. The targets for 2015 are only to move on for the Valuation Office orders for Galway city and counties Carlow and Kilkenny. The Government believes the rest of the authorities will be done in the next four years. The Government wants to complete the required global valuations and asset valuation mechanisms. Irish Water comes into this, so will we get a briefing note on Committee Stage on the protocol used by the Valuation Office to value Irish Water? That has never been done before. The Minister has mentioned a figure of €60 million but nobody knows where that came from. We want to see it worked out, as I indicated at the committee, and we want to see how the global valuation for Irish Water is formulated before we pass the legislation. We will have amendments in that respect. This is a 19th century system and two thirds of it has gone with the elimination of agricultural and domestic rates. This should have been done 20 or 30 years ago and we should now have a self-assessment system, like every other tax in the country. The amount should be based on profitability, level of business and ability to pay. None of this is included in the legislation, which is why we oppose it.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I welcome that we have a Bill, however late and imperfect. The system is from the 1800s and I have had many difficulties with it as a public representative, even before I came near this building, because of the problems experienced by constituents. It is clear that something does need to be done with rates, and this legislation represents an attempt by the Government to do this. It was originally introduced in the Seanad with the support of the Minister and we have seen a number of other proposals from Government and Opposition Members on the issue over the past two years. I was happy to support the proposal on rateable valuations for community and sports organisations. We have all raised the issue of excluding parts of these properties other than bars from being subject to rates. Unfortunately, although the Government did not oppose the First Reading of an Opposition Bill, nothing has been done subsequently or in this Bill to address the case of premises owned by such organisations. We must make the issue clear in this Bill but the changes to the definition of charitable organisations included in section 2 do not address the problem in question. There are other issues raised by this Bill which have been highlighted by a number of groups and which will need to be addressed through amendment if it proceeds to Committee Stage. There is clearly an urgent need to address the rates issue, as it has not been looked at for a number of years. It has been claimed by people involved with small businesses in particular that the failure to reassess rates during the recent downturn proved fatal to a sizeable number of small businesses which were unable to pay rates from a declining income. The current regime under which valuations are made dates back to 2002 and originates in the system from the 1800s. That was before the massive financial collapse, which led to a consequent collapse in incomes for many commercial businesses nationwide. At present there is no facility to provide for revision of a property’s rateable valuation based on those downward movements in values.  This is something I have raised before in the context of legacy rates, which need to be addressed. These are hangovers from previous occupiers and there is a need to assess new businesses on the basis of their own viability rather than on what might have been the case with previous occupiers. The fact that many premises were and are empty proves that rates and rents continue to present a massive obstacle in the way of start-up enterprises. The consequences of that can be seen in the many empty premises that blight the streets, towns and villages of the country. We can see it right around the State, with the commercial hearts of towns lying derelict, despite the efforts of tidy towns committees or surviving businesses. In Laois, in towns and villages like Mountmellick, Mountrath, Abbeyleix, Rathdowney, the formerly vibrant area of Portarlington, Stradbally and Ballinakill, there are sections of streets closed down. I know rates are not the only problem. It is welcome that the Bill has provision for material change in circumstances, although we may need to amend the proposal to improve it. If a licence is gone from a public house, the premises would be worth a fraction of the value - if it was ever worth it - from the boom. That changes everything. The old AIB premises in Mountrath is worth a small fraction now of what it was worth a number of years ago. There are many other examples throughout the county. In Portarlington and other towns, the nature of what is happening and what can operate in the premises has changed. I have mentioned Laois towns like Mountmellick, Portarlington, Mountrath and Rathdowney that have a section of a street that lies vacant. Surely it would be better for the local authority, the community and the local economy, which is part of the national economy, if we could get some income from those properties which now lie vacant. There was an earlier reference to a business incentive scheme in Laois and I proposed a similar scheme 12 years ago. I was nearly devoured at that stage by the colleagues of people who are now lauding that scheme. There could be an incentive provided for starting new businesses and although there is an argument that existing businesses could be displaced, there are ways of dealing with such issues. Laois County Council has introduced an innovative scheme with grants instead of rate reductions.There is no reason that there cannot be a system for towns such as Mountmellick, Rathdowney, Mountrath or the other towns I mentioned to provide the incentive of a rates reduction for a new business that is not displacing or challenging an existing business providing the same service in the same area. It could be a gradual scale of 25% of the rates in the first year, 50% in the second year and 75% in the third year. We have done something similar for getting people back into employment and there has been some success with it. It has not always been successful, but we do not have success with everything. There is no single solution to this, but such an incentive should form part of the package for trying to get town and village centres revitalised and inhabited again. It is startling to drive through, not to mind walk around, towns throughout the State. In Laois, for example, it is startling to count the number of vacant premises as one walks around the towns. Only a handful of businesses are now operating on O'Connell Square in the centre of Mountmellick, where previously there were dozens of businesses. There is also the issue of getting people back to living in town centres. That must be part of the solution as well. We must make it fashionable again to live in town centres and to use the space over shops. Where there are existing businesses or shop units - it might be a Centra or a Spar - one regularly sees that the storeys above are derelict or semi-derelict. That does not augur well for the future. We must consider that as part of an overall package. The Laois scheme is an effort by Laois County Council to do something about all of that. However, it is also necessary that the Government and the Departments of Finance and Environment, Community and Local Government examine issues such as rates. I must also mention the issue of upward only rent reviews, and this is not an attempt to head-butt the Minister on the matter. It is a problem. It is lunacy to have a situation where commercial rents can only go upwards. Imagine trying to run a business on the basis that something can only go upwards in price and that one can never reduce the price of something on the shelf. No business could operate like that. We are talking about commercial realities and the world of capitalism here. It is outside this building. When one walks onto Kildare Street one is into that world. We must try to deal with this issue. Spokespersons for the Government have said there is a constitutional impediment. I have heard that said in respect of many things over the last 30 years and, to be honest, listening to it has put grey hairs on my head. I am extremely concerned about this. If there is an impediment, why not change that clause in the Constitution? We are changing the Constitution to give a young person the right to become President. I support that, but it will hardly shake the world. This is a far more important issue for this Government to address, but it has failed to do so. The previous Government also failed to address it so the current Government inherited the problem. The two issues of rates based on the real value of the property and upward only rents must form part of a package. We repeatedly hear lectures about enterprise. Our party wishes to see businesses survive and develop. We want to give people a leg up, particularly people in small businesses. Everybody is aware of the statistics regarding the number of people employed by small business. Members of this House have a responsibility to deal with the rent issue. We cannot simply doddle along through the Government's term and leave it for the next Government to tackle. The attitude is that the five years are nearly over so the Government cannot do it. Somebody must grasp this issue. I appeal to the Government to do it, given that it has approximately 14 months left in office so it has the opportunity. Dealing with this issue would leave a far greater legacy, particularly for regional development and for town centres. I have given the example of the towns in Laois. The problem of upward only rents is having a huge effect on the town of Portlaoise, as is the rigidity of the rates scheme. We are supposed to be experiencing a significant economic upturn, or at least the beginnings of such an upturn. I hope that proves to be the case, but the fact that new businesses are still being forced to close their doors within a short period of starting up is worrying. In that context, redressing the problem with rates is important but I am not confident this Bill does enough to do that. We must ensure that we can have an impact. The Government's record in respect of rent reviews is not encouraging with regard to creating the conditions where start-up enterprises have a better chance of thriving without having to set aside a huge chunk of their income to pay rents which are often arbitrarily increased. These are the two major issues that continue to be raised by small businesses. The consequences of failing to alleviate the burden on small businesses can be seen in the many premises that remain empty throughout the country. Even in Dublin, and close to Leinster House which is in the highest value area of the city, we can see premises that remain unused or premises where new businesses have opened in the last year or two but closed again within a short period. Many of those business owners claim that they would have had a viable business but they were unable to survive due to the massive burden of rates and rents. With regard to the provision in section 4 relating to the exemption of State property for the purposes of rates, how does this relate to Irish Water? Irish Water received an exemption. First, the Government took a bill of €500 million back from Irish Water and handed it to Joe and Mary public by giving it to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan. It related to the money owed to the Housing Finance Agency for water services. The Government also drew a line through a little over €59 million in rates this year. Irish Water paid over €40 million last year but this year it will pay nothing. As far as I am aware, it is the only commercial semi-State company that is not paying rates. Bord na Móna, Coillte and the ESB are substantial ratepayers. They make a substantial contribution to Laois County Council because they have headquarters or branches in County Laois. The sleight of hand regarding Irish Water has made it rates exempt. That has been done to improve its balance sheet. It is part of the voodoo economics the Government has engaged in to make Irish Water look right for EUROSTAT and to keep as much as possible off-balance sheet. Will Irish Water be exempt forever? Is it just for this year or will it enjoy the same privilege of not having to pay rates next year? Again, the taxpayer will pick up the tab. Section 6 provides for the appointment of a person who is not an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation or attached to the Valuation Tribunal to carry out valuations. There must be a clearer definition of who that will be. Is it proposed that such an appointee might come from a private company engaged in the property sector? Will we outsource this to the agents of developers? This proposed outsourcing has serious implications. It would not be a healthy development and there must be a clearer explanation of who it is proposed might assume such an important role. If it is a local valuer, does the Minister know how many auctioneers and valuers there are in the country? One cannot throw a stone without hitting one, given that so many auctioneers and valuers licences were issued over the years. I am very concerned about somebody carrying out that role on behalf of the Government and of the taxpayer. Self assessment for rates has been suggested. We have done it for local property tax, LPT, so I cannot see why it cannot be done for rates. It has also been used for other forms of taxation. However, to outsource this to companies and people who might have a far different interest from the people paying the rates is very worrying.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	In September 2011, in response to the offer by Ryanair to buy out Aer Lingus, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, outlined the Government's position when he stated: "The Government remains committed to the sale of the stake in Aer Lingus at the right time under the right conditions." The Minister, as the Tánaiste is aware, also stated at that time that the Government's position was that the 25% shareholding by the State in Aer Lingus was not of strategic value. This statement was made against a backdrop of deep concerns expressed by tourism and business interests about the potential loss of connectivity between Shannon and Cork and Heathrow and the potential for reduction in the frequency of services between Dublin and Heathrow. This morning, on "Today with Sean O'Rourke", the chief executive of IAG, Willie Walsh, said that the Government's stated position in selling the shareholding was the reason IAG had entered the marketplace at this time. He and his organisation took some succour from the stated position, and that is the reason we are in this position at the moment. In response to the IAG indicative offer, on 27 January the Government established an interdepartmental advisory group to flesh out the bones of that possible deal. On 1 February, on RTE's "This Week" programme, the Taoiseach stated that he wanted a "cast iron guarantee" on connectivity before the Government would consider any formal offer for Aer Lingus. When does the Tánaiste expect the advisory group to report to the Government? Is the Government, particularly the Labour Party, still committed to the sale of Aer Lingus, as it was in 2011? In light of Willie Walsh's comments this morning, when he stated that he was prepared to give not just cast iron guarantees on connectivity but cast iron guarantees cased in concrete, are the Tánaiste and the Labour Party happy to proceed with the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus to IAG?

The connections to and from this island are vital. They are vital for us and for Irish people around the world travelling to and from the island. They are vital for foreign direct investment, which has been significant in Ireland. Furthermore, following the effective devaluation of the euro, we expect a further improvement in income and business from tourism, particularly given the successful development of the Wild Atlantic Way, an initiative of this Government. Connectivity to and from Ireland is of the utmost importance in any examination of the bid put forward by IAG. Employment in Aer Lingus is also an issue. I have stated this previously. The sale of the majority stake in Aer Lingus of just under 75% was undertaken by the Deputy's party when it was in Government in the mid-2000s for a sum in the region of €289 million.

The Deputy was a Senator at the time and an enthusiastic backer of that particular proposition. This is how the country ended up having a minority, but significant, stake in Aer Lingus, at 25.1%. Under the takeover rules, the Government must examine any offers. Mr. Walsh is coming before an Oireachtas committee this afternoon. I am sure people such as the Deputy will have some very detailed questions. Under the takeover rules, I cannot comment in detail. However, I can say that on previous occasions when the issue of the potential sale of this stake arose, along with employment in Aer Lingus and services to and from Dublin, Shannon and Cork, connections in and out of the country for Irish people, tourism and investment have been critical factors in any evaluation.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	Another five people, including two minors and a pensioner, have been arrested in west Tallaght this morning. A further four people, again including a child, were arrested yesterday. Seventeen arrests have been made to date. It is reported that up to 33 people will be detained in the coming days. The scale of Garda resources deployed for these arrests stands in marked contrast to the lack of Garda response in many communities when families report serious crime. The number of gardaí used to arrest an elected Member of this House and members of South Dublin County Council stands in stark contrast to the lack of community gardaí on the ground in communities inflicted in some instances with drug related and gangland crime.

I would like to make it clear that I do not believe it is acceptable in a democracy to protest at politicians' homes. Equally, it is not acceptable to detain politicians, political staff or council workers as they go about their business. I do not believe it is appropriate to aggressively target the Office of the President. I believe protests should be peaceful and dignified. Indeed, that is what they have been for the most part. I share the concern of a growing number of people that what gardaí are doing is of a political nature. Does the Tánaiste share my concern that there is a campaign to criminalise the people of Jobstown and the hundreds of thousands of people who are campaigning against water charges? Does she share the view that the level of Garda resources being deployed is over the top and is in stark contrast to the lack of response to victims of crime in west Tallaght and elsewhere? Does she stand over the manner in which gardaí are conducting these arrests and treating the people of Jobstown?

Equally, it is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether people are charged and matters are consequently put before the courts. People who have any complaints about the manner in which they have been dealt with by An Garda Síochána can make those complaints to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. It is important for Members of the House to remember that this country is governed by the rule of law. We should let the law take its course without interference or hindrance from anybody. It would clearly be wrong of me to say anything that would interfere in any way with any investigation.

I would not do so. I acknowledge the independence of the Garda and indeed the independence of the Judiciary, both of which are essential pillars of our functioning democratic system.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	I uphold the Constitution. Like any member of the Government, I am required to do so. I respect the independence of the Judiciary, the independence of the Garda and the availability of an independent complaints system. It is important for anyone who speaks on these matters in this House not to reflect in any negative way on the independence of these institutional and constitutional arrangements, which are the cornerstone of our democracy. I visit communities throughout the State frequently. I have found that protestors appear to favour protesting against ceremonies, events and institutions to do with education. The people who were receiving their awards and degrees in Jobstown were celebrating an important day in their lives and those of their communities.

Like other Members of this House, I served as a member of that county council for a period. I regret what happened to the Fianna Fáil Mayor of Fingal County Council, Councillor Mags Murray, whom I have known over a long time. When she wanted to leave the council meeting to visit her daughter who was ill in hospital, she was remonstrated with in a very cruel and, in my view, utterly misguided way.

I suggest that they think again. I do not understand why they prevented a mother going to see her sick daughter after the finish of a council meeting.

How does it sit with the Tánaiste that complaints she made against people who protested her visit to Jobstown in November have resulted in these outrageous raids by entire squads of gardaí, trawling for evidence on incidents that were blown out of all proportion by her and some of her friends in sections of the media?

Is her wounded political vanity so precious that she needs this vindictive attempt to criminalise an entire working class community in this way? Hundreds of decent people in Jobstown and Tallaght who took part in a protest are in genuine fear that they will be arrested. Who will mind their children and so on? The Tánaiste stated that she was independent and she mentioned An Cosán. Let us be honest. She was not wanted by the people getting their degrees at An Cosán. That was made perfectly clear.

That may not be good enough for Deputy Coppinger, but the Constitution of this Republic and an independent Garda operation are paramount for me and anybody who respects the former.

Is she happy that teenagers are missing school? Is she happy that mothers are afraid that they will be rounded up any morning? Is this going to continue in batches of four and five for the next ten days until she reaches the magical figure of 40 or 50 that has been suggested in the media?I have given the Tánaiste major historical examples of taoisigh, of a higher standing even than herself, who had their cars impeded and blocked. This is nothing new. Is it different when it is students or working class people? That seems to be what the Tánaiste is saying.

Would the Tánaiste express her sympathy with him? That is shown on some of the video footage as well. On Tuesday, the Tánaiste grievously betrayed women suffering the trauma of fatal foetal abnormality by her stance.

These actions will definitely backfire. People will boycott the water charges, which is essentially what this is about. The Tánaiste is trying to demonise protestors at a key time in the battle against water charges, but this will rebound. I have no doubt that the Tánaiste will be gone in the next election, and probably the entire Labour Party with her, and so too will the water charges.

If Deputy Paul Murphy has complaints to make, he is perfectly entitled to make a complaint in that respect to An Garda Síochána and to the Garda Ombudsman Commission. That is his option, as it is with any other citizen, if he feels that, as Deputy Coppinger suggests, he was manhandled by gardaí.

If she did, I, as a member of the Fine Gael Party and a Member of this House, would like her to withdraw that remark. It is beneath her to call members of An Garda Síochána "dogs".

I want to be clear. In terms of the honour due to gardaí, many of whom have lost their lives or suffered serious injury in defending this State, it would be wise for Deputy Coppinger to remove and resile from the figure of speech that she acknowledges she used of "calling off the dogs". Our gardaí are not to be referred to in those terms. As regards what happened at Fingal County Council, where Deputy Coppinger and I had the privilege to serve as councillors, it is not right that the mayor of Fingal was obstructed by demonstrators from seeing her daughter in hospital. Deputy Coppinger should disassociate herself from those people.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	On the health information Bill, it is reported that the HSE sent correspondence to the Department of Health in which it sought a budget increase of €1.4 billion for 2015. This would represent a net increase of approximately €900 million. As the Tánaiste is aware, the HSE was only granted an increase of €115 million in the budget. The Minister for Health is on record as denying that any request such was made or that he was seeking anything like that amount that was requested. What happened in the period between the correspondence in question being received in the Department of Health and the announcement of the budget? There has been a deafening silence in respect of this matter. Perhaps the Tánaiste will provide a commitment that the relevant information will be made available to the House. In the context of the industrial relations (amendment) (No. 2) Bill, the Tánaiste will be aware that the trade union Mandate is in the process of balloting its members in Dunnes Stores. Retail workers in Dunnes Stores are encountering extreme difficulties in terms of how their zero-hours contracts are being implemented. I understand their grievances have been brought to the attention of management. What is happening is very unfair to workers because they face losing part of their salaries if strike action is taken. Surely it must be possible for an intervention to be made in order that a satisfactory solution to the dispute might be found.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	I anticipate that the collective bargaining legislation to which the Deputy just referred will be introduced later this year. As the Deputy knows, the HSE received significant increases in its budget for this year and last year. It was also the recipient of sizeable supplementary budgets. I understand that major challenges remain in the context of improving both the health service and levels of delivery within it. This year, the HSE received its first significant budget increase in a very long time.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	385	This morning we learned that the HSE's CEO, Mr. Tony O'Brien, warned the Government that its failure to provide sufficient funding for the health service this year will lead to significant clinical risks for patients. Mr. O'Brien's memo to the Department of Health indicates that these risks are most acute in the context of accident and emergency departments-----
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	386	Is the Deputy seeking a debate?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	387	-----maternity care, vital procedures and primary care. In light of what I have just outlined, there is an urgent need for the Minister for Health to make a full statement to the Dáil on this issue. There have been conflicting accounts from the Government in respect of funding requests from the HSE in respect of the health service. It is essential that the Minister come before the Dáil to set out the position in clear and unequivocal terms, particularly in the context of contacts he has had with and the nature of requests made to him by the HSE. I have raised the matter of the Constitutional Convention with both the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach but I have not got very far with either of them. It is clear that the Government is not going to hold referendums on a number of proposals and recommendations made by the convention, much less schedule debates on the issues involved. Will the Tánaiste at least clarify the Government's position on the removal of the women-in-the-home clause from the 1937 Constitution, as the convention recommended? Does the Government share the view that this clause should be removed from the Constitution?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	388	On the question of the Minister for Health making a statement or taking part in a debate in the House in respect of both the additional funding provided to the health service for this year and the way in which the Minister is seeking better deals with regard to drug prices, I am quite sure the Whips, subject to discussions among them, would be happy to arrange for this to happen at an appropriate time. The Government has received the reports of the Constitutional Convention and it is committed to holding two referenda in the early part of the summer in respect of marriage equality and the age of qualification for those who wish to stand as candidates in Presidential elections. We do not have any proposals to hold further constitutional referenda at this point. The Government has received the convention's recommendation regarding the women-in-the-home clause in the Constitution. However, no date has been set for a referendum in respect of that matter.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	392	My understanding is that the children and family relationships Bill, which was the subject of a briefing given by the Minister for Justice and Equality to Deputies of all parties both yesterday and this morning, will be brought before the Government next Tuesday. I anticipate that the Second Stage will take place, subject to agreement among the Whips, between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Friday next and 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Monday week. It is anticipated that Committee Stage will be taken shortly thereafter, followed by Report Stage. The Bill will, therefore, pass through the House in the coming weeks. I understand the Minister for Justice and Equality has offered briefings on the legislation and that the opportunity to avail of these has been accepted by a number of parties. If the Deputy is interested in availing of a further briefing, I will ask the Minister to make arrangements in that regard.

I ask this question in the context of the Down's Syndrome (Equality of Access) Bill 2013, which I brought forward and which was agreed to by the Government and Fianna Fáil. That legislation, had it been enacted, could have been used to resolve this issue. Now, however, parents are going to resort to taking legal action and the State will be obliged to spend money defending cases before the courts. Will the Tánaiste intervene, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that proper resource hours are allocated to children with Down's syndrome?

The Minister is proposing that a series of pilot projects be put in place in the coming years. I have met the parents of children with Down's syndrome and I am aware that the Minister is determined to address this issue. With the possibility of being able to provide increased resources as the economy recovers and begins to perform better, I hope the issues that have given rise to concern will be addressed.

As the Tánaiste is aware, the mobility allowance scheme was discontinued in respect of new applicants.Granted, existing participants were allowed to retain their allowance. The scheme was discontinued a number of years ago on the promise by the Government that legislation would be introduced to deal with this matter.

When will we see the necessary legislation to give effect to the new scheme so new applicants will be able to apply?

Having secured an additional 1,700 new appointments, including approximately 350 special needs assistants, in primary and secondary schools this year, I certainly hope circumstances will improve as additional resources are allocated. With regard to PPS numbers and the primary online database, my understanding — the Deputy may ask detailed questions of the Minister and raise this at committee level for detailed discussion — is that the model in question is the general model of using data to help with the allocation of resources. The good news is that as the economy has been improving, we have been building new schools and allocating significant additional resources for education. I expect this will continue.

The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has said he will introduce a new tenant purchase scheme and that it will come under the housing Bill. That Bill keeps getting pushed out further but it is extremely important that we deal with this as soon as possible. There are hundreds of people across this city waiting anxiously to purchase their own homes.

In short, this Bill provides for a piercing of the corporate veil to hold unscrupulous employers to account and protect vulnerable workers. When used by a few rogue employers, the corporate veil separates the legal personality of a company from its directors, thus protecting them from liability for the business's obligations to its employees in cases of tactical insolvency. This Bill has a particular eye on employers who shirk their responsibilities to their employees by establishing a number of companies to break the link between assets and employees. Over the past number of years, there have been a number of high-profile company closures in which workers have had to resort to sit-ins or strike action in an effort to claw back unpaid wages and access redundancy and other entitlements. These are entitlements for which they have already laboured and provided a service. The examples are well known - the Paris Bakery, Vita Cortex, La Senza, HMV, Game, Thomas Cook and Connolly Shoes, and in my constituency, the Darnley Lodge Hotel. We have had much tea and sympathy from the Government. I have witnessed Labour Party Ministers, in front of Leinster House, with staff from the Paris Bakery gathered around - people who were in a serious situation in which they could not live on a day-to-day basis - say they would go back into the Oireachtas and do all within their power to make sure this did not happen again. But despite this tea and sympathy, the Government has taken no concrete action to address the legal protections that these rogue employers currently enjoy. I and other Opposition Deputies have repeatedly raised with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and at committee meetings the problems associated with tactical insolvencies and the corporate veil legal protections that are enjoyed by a small number of rogue employers, but to no avail. I even submitted a rack of amendments to Government legislation in the hope that the Minister and, indeed, his Labour Party Cabinet colleagues would deal with the shortfalls of the existing principle in company law that a director's duties are owed to the company and not to his or her employees. Existing company law is deficient as it facilitates such employers in building paper walls within entities or creating multiple entities with the specific intent of separating assets and goods from the legal entity that employs the staff. It is not acceptable for us as legislators to simply sit on our hands and speak of principles, as if the existing law is some sort of immovable feast. Indeed, many are involved in sit-ins for months as they find it impossible to feed their children, heat their homes and pay their rent or mortgage. People are being pushed into poverty by this issue. Employers who adversely use the protection of the corporate veil principle are also undermining the vast majority of decent employers who uphold their responsibilities to their staff, and are adding a cost to the State's already overburdened industrial relations mechanisms. Any decent employer in the State who fulfils his or her responsibility to employees will have nothing to fear from this Bill. Such employers will incur no cost from it. This Bill seeks only to chase those who stuff the employees who have worked for them for years. There are limited instances in company law in which a director, a shareholder or a financial institution can take an action against another director of a company where he or she is in breach of his or her duty, causing damage to the company. There is no similar provision in employment law to protect workers. To date, the Government has failed to put any proposal on the legislative table to deal with abuse of the corporate veil. We are in the dying days of this Administration and it is quite unlikely, if it starts a project, that it will bring it to full implementation before the next general election. There is time pressure here. That is why I would appeal to the Government, especially the Labour Party members, to take this Bill on board. They should allow it to proceed through the Oireachtas so that we can discuss it and maybe, if necessary, amend it, but we should get the objective fulfilled. I introduce this Bill in the hope that it might serve as a starting point for action by this Government. It is Sinn Féin's strong view that vulnerable employees need this protection and that rogue employers must be held to account.

In the past number of years, significant strides have been made in road safety in this country. The RSA has been to the fore in pushing the agenda of road safety. We have seen the number of people killed on the roads decrease substantially over the past number of years. There has been a bit of a blip in the past year, but in general, significant strides have been made. It is important that we look at this aspect of road safety and the implications. There are different speed limits in different areas throughout the country. In moving from one local authority area to another, different speed limits apply. There are no fixed rules on speed limits. Particularly in residential areas, we need to set standards for main roads, motorways and secondary roads, and that is what this Bill is designed to do. It is to set these standards right across the board. It also is important that residents in housing estates see that there are fixed rules for estates in every county, because sometimes when one travels from one county to another there are different speed limits. Speeds limits of 30 kilometres per hour have been introduced in Dublin city, which seem to have worked well in some areas. My party asks that the Government let this important Bill proceed. We badly need this debate. We need to look at standardising these speed limits. We also need to give instructions to the local authorities. They need to have it clear that specific limits are laid down and that they cannot introduce speed limits willy-nilly. It has been confusing throughout the country when one moves from one local authority area to another. I ask the Minister to allow this Bill to proceed.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	436	To continue where I left off, section 6 proposes the appointment of a person who is not an officer of the Commissioner of Valuation or attached to the valuation tribunal to carry out valuations. It needs to be made clearer what the intention is in the Bill. The concern my party has relates to the possible outsourcing of that to a company involved in the property sector. This poses considerable risks. Many things were outsourced by the previous Government, and we saw the problems that caused in terms of the influence the contracted party can have over the public sector and how things can be manipulated by consultants and others.Sometimes, people criticise the Civil Service but large parts of it work very well. Of course there is always need for improvement and to update, upgrade and make things more efficient. However, we must not throw out what is good nor lose sight of it. The one thing the Civil Service is good at is keeping things in a straight line. Civil servants are very cautious and careful. Some whom I have met are overly cautious and too careful for my liking but that is the nature of things. That is the tension between elected representatives and civil servants. What the Minister of State has outlined poses considerable risks. Self-assessment is one suggestion that was previously made and it should be seriously considered. The proposal in section 7 to publish a list of properties prior to rates being imposed would be a good move, as it would allow for a more transparent process, and for the case to be made on new valuations. That would perhaps help to address the situation I referred to earlier where businesses claim that they are being subjected to rates that bear no relation to the climate in which they are attempting to operate. Section 10 also touches on the area of appeals regarding valuations. Similarly, section 14 allows an occupier a period of 40 days in which to make an appeal in a case where the commissioner has decided that there should not be a downward revision of rates due to changed circumstances. It has been argued that there should be a longer period than 40 days in which such appeals can be made to allow people more time to make a proper case. It has been argued that the definition of "material change in circumstances" needs to be widened. A broader definition would allow a ratepayer to seek a revision of a rateable valuation where there has been a significant fall in a property’s net value or rental value since the rateable valuation was last entered in the valuation list. Footfall and the location of a property are considerations for staff of the Valuation Office when they make a determination on the rateable valuation of a property. If premises in a town centre have only 30% to 40% occupancy that must be factored into the process. One could ask whether there is a case to be made for mandatory revaluations on a more regular basis. I was made aware this week of a good example of the consequences of the failure to re-assess rates in the context of the changed economic climate. It relates to a premises in south Dublin which has been mostly vacant since 2007. The main reason given for the failure to rent the premises to a new occupier is the difficulty of sustaining a business because the valuation and rates on which the rent is based bear no relation to the radically changed economic climate in the past ten years. When the premises was first valued, the rent and rate assessment took place in the 2000s and the economic situation and everything else is completely different now. The current rates bill is based on a rateable value of €56,400. That was based on an assessment made in September 2005 by South Dublin County Council. That was at a time when retail income levels even for the smallest units had rocketed. At the time rents were at an all-time, historic high. The rate was not sustainable since the downturn in 2008. That proves we need more regular revaluations based on changed economic circumstances. The case I have outlined is very graphic but it is not uncommon. I have heard of other such cases. It has been argued that not only the current regulations, but also the provisions in the Bill, provide a definition of changed circumstances that would make it very difficult for current occupiers to secure an assessment based on changed circumstances as they relate to income levels and rent. If the Government is serious about maximising the potential of the improved economic conditions, it must do more to address the situation. I am aware of the importance of rates, in particular as an income source for local authorities. We spoke many times about the narrow basis of local authorities to generate funding. The local property tax should go to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. I accept the point does not relate to the matter under discussion but a minimum of 80% of local property tax should go to the local authority where it is collected. It should not be sucked out and brought into general Exchequer funding and siphoned off to bodies such as Irish Water. We must maintain the rateable base but we must do so in as fair a way as possible. Getting businesses to return to vacant properties would encourage an upturn in local economies through increased employment and local spending, which would benefit the wider community. Such activity might appear to be small and insignificant but local spending makes an incremental difference when it happens in hundreds or thousands of places throughout the country. In turn, that will benefit local authorities because towns such as those I mentioned which get nothing currently would get rates paid. Instead of having a row of empty shops there is a benefit if two or three premises are occupied, even if they are paying half the specified rate. When determining the rateable valuation of a premises, consideration must be given to the type of business in operation. Currently, a bank next door to a greengrocer with the same size of premises pays the same rate even though the businesses are different. Banks operate on a completely different basis. Banks and greengrocers must have different rates. The income level must be factored into the valuation. Revenue knows the income level. One cannot fiddle such details even if the system is based on self-assessment because the figures are on Revenue's books. The income from a business must have some bearing on the rateable valuation. There are a number of ways in which the Bill could be improved, some of which can be addressed on Committee Stage through relevant amendments. I refer to provisions to take account of the radically changed circumstances which have pertained since the onset of the economic downturn six to seven years ago. While it might be argued that we are now in the early stages of an economic upturn, and I hope we are, it is clear that rates and rent still present an obstacle, in some cases on a huge scale. It can be a tipping point in terms of survival for new businesses when they start up. The Bill does not properly address many of the issues I have outlined. I welcome the update of the previous system. The system was due to be overhauled in 2012 but this is the here and now. Tomorrow is the first day of the future. We should try to make the Bill as good and fair as we can in order to have a good, transparent system of rates that will help small businesses and employment and also help to fund local authorities in a sustainable way. I urge the Government to be open to the amendments. We do not table them in an attempt to head butt the Government or to have a go at it. We are not always right either, but we table the amendments sincerely in an attempt to ensure we have the best possible legislation for small businesses, local authorities and the economy.

I accept a strategy is currently being developed for rural areas. We welcome anything that will put a bit of life into rural towns and villages.Shops and businesses are closing down in rural Ireland and high rates are the main problem, with businesses being stifled as a result. Every business that closes down means less money, and the maths do not add up. I understand that rates must be collected and paid and I am not naive enough to think we could get rid of them, lock, stock and barrel. I suggest that the rate should be based on the worst year of the previous three or four years and businesses should be given some breathing space because for every business that closes there is less money being raised by rates. The equalisation fund could be used as a stimulus package. There should be an effort to encourage more businesses in towns by basing the rates on the worst year. The smaller towns should be given some breathing space. I remember that a package of measures was introduced a few years ago which allowed up to five years remission from payment of rates or a staggered payment arrangement such as 20% in the first year and an increase in the rate over five years. I recommend the Minister of State to consider measures for the hospitality sector. For example, if a new business or hotel had no competitor within 10 km, the business would be given a break of five years from payment of rates. This would likely apply in smaller towns in Roscommon such as Ballinlough or Strokestown. I see all these towns that are dying on their knees. We need to begin to think outside the box in trying to revive these smaller towns throughout the country. This legislation will cripple the amount of money being raised. For example, throughout the country there are probably 110 or 115 quarries which have paid large sums in rates. They have been trying to survive and they have been willing to pay the rates. As a result of crazy types of paperwork, the minute they become compliant, they are told that they are not compliant and they are supposed to shut down. The do-gooders of this country are honing in and trying to tell county councils to write letters to all these quarries. If this happens, it will have a severe impact on Government spending on roads, on employment and on the level of rates collected. We need to get real about where we are going. In respect of the construction of new roads, not necessarily motorways, or where roads are upgraded, the smaller towns on those routes need to be protected by the provision of a slip road into the towns. A filling station or places to eat on the side of the road will take business away from the small towns. To ensure the survival of these smaller towns, it will be necessary to provide incentives. The Lidls and Tescos of this world have built out of town, with the result that town centres are being decimated. In conjunction with councils, we should examine the area of parking charges and consider providing incentives, be it through rates or otherwise, to try to revive town centres. On what is happening in rural areas, I was speaking recently to an auctioneer in Strokestown. A fabrication company was willing to take over a building that has been closed since 2009. The company took it for €10,000 per year and two weeks later it got the word that the rates would be €18,000. That factory was closed the following day and eight jobs were gone. We persist in burying our heads in the sand. I do not blame the councils because they have to get in as much money as possible. However, we need to devise a national strategy to revive these towns. The rates bills for hotels sold in Roscommon, Leitrim and east Galway have been up to €40,000. I suggest that if a business provides employment, it should be given some credit with regard to rates. Every person taken off the live register means €15,000 to €20,000 of government money saved. However, if we intend to keep crippling businesses then those people will not be in employment. We must provide the incentives. I ask the Minister of State to consider some of those points.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	439	I refer to the complex and technical measures used by the Valuation Office in producing the rateable valuation figures. The local authorities decide what funding they need for the year and then they work backwards and introduce a rate which will produce the money. This system is not ideal and it puts the local authority in a very difficult position. It is tough trying to run a business in Dublin which depends on the domestic economy but it is even more difficult in the countryside. It is a big problem if the local authority is compelled to be tough on small businesses to get the money to run its operations. It is not an ideal method for collecting that money. In 2014 there was a vacancy rate in premises in Wexford of 13% as a result of the downturn. The percentage of rates collected was just over 69%. It is the case that money cannot be got because businesses are finding it too challenging to pay rates. The growth of Tesco, Aldi and Lidl has put very great pressure on small shops. It is very difficult for a small shop in competition with the big supermarkets to be able to pay rates. When a council introduces its rate of valuation, it is not considering how a particular business is doing. Deputy Fleming suggested that it might be better to tie the rateable valuation to rent and there is some logic to that argument. The Minister of State may be able to highlight pitfalls in that suggestion of which I am not aware. I see so many places in the countryside in my county of Wexford, for example, where life is very difficult for businesses. I have been speaking to the people who collect the rates in Wexford and they find it almost impossible to collect the rates from pubs. When the pubs were doing well a few years ago, many of them built big lounges because they knew they could fill them. Nowadays, they may only be using one third or a half of the premises but they are being rated on the entire premises. There is not a rateable valuation for half of a premises whereby the rate is only charged on the space being utilised. I suggest the Government should consider such a rate because it is a rational idea. If the owner makes the case that he is only using half of the premises, I do not think it is fair to ask him to pay for areas he is not using. Likewise, the same argument could be made for vacant units. In Wexford, for example, a vacant unit attracts 100% relief from rates but the rate is 50% in Dublin.A couple of years ago I had a warehouse in which we could have played football. We bought it to knock down and build apartments, but while it was still standing we used it as a store. The rates on it were draconian as we paid 50% of what they would have been if it was being used for commercial purposes. It was a bit harsh. A problem is coming down the tracks in places such as Wexford where urban councils are being done away with. The rate on valuation which has been fixed for 2015 by Wexford County Council is €71.52. New Ross is not a thriving town and life there is difficult for small and medium-sized businesses. The rate on valuation there is €55.47. Dragging these businesses up to a rate on valuation of €71.52, which will be done over a few years, will be very difficult for them and this should be considered. If business is weak in one town but very good in another town 20 km away, the same commercial rates should not be charged in both. Ability to pay is not factored into rates, but it is at the core of the issue. How to do it best is challenging, but I believe the idea of tying it to rent would come close. We have had some problems with rates on properties and I was very curious as to how things were done in Dublin city. I went to the Valuation Office, where Patrick Kyne and Declan Lavelle work, and I was really impressed at how it does things. The staff there do their best with a very archaic system. They were very impressive. I could see they are trying to be as fair as they can. I spent approximately two hours there and we looked at all of the various streets in Dublin, which I know pretty well, and the different rates on different streets. One guideline the office has is to grade units from A to D, depending on how far they are from the footpath. Those graded A are most expensive because they have the most shop front. We have a wine bar on Russell Street and it is almost all A graded, including the kitchen, which makes the rates very high. It does not take on board the fact we do not have tables in all of the area, whereas most restaurants place their tables as close as they can to the street front. People like to see their food being cooked, and it is good for a restaurant to be able to do this. We put the kitchen very close to the street with the tables around it. We are being punished because the kitchen is too close to the street. We are paying far too much in rates for kitchen space and storage. It is very challenging for the Valuation Office to come up with a fair system that works fluidly across the board. We have just been revalued in Dublin and there has been debate about it. The rents on two of our units have reduced by approximately 30% but the rates on them have increased by approximately 35%. This does not make commercial sense. The rent reflects the value of the unit at the time and its earning capacity. If a unit can make a lot of money, the guy who owns the building will charge a bit more for it and it will be reflected in the rent. A decrease in rent also reflects the level of business going on at the particular time. The fact the rates are not connected to this is problematic. I am not so sure how this would be done without tying them directly to rent but it needs to be examined. The Minister of State spoke about appeals and stated a more efficient appeals mechanism will be put in place, which is to be welcomed. Revaluations will take place every five to ten years. I would like to think they will be closer to every five years than every ten years because economies go up and down in cycles. I know valuations cost money but they should be done regularly. The rates on some of our units have been set but already I would like to appeal them. I do not know whether the Bill will let us back in the door to speak to the Valuation Office because of how recently the rates have been set. We feel the rates are fair on some of the units and we can see the logic behind the final figures, but we do not see the same logic behind the figures for other units. Perhaps the Bill will allow us to challenge some of them as it would make sense. Earlier I mentioned the many vacant units in the country. When someone considers the prospect of renting a unit, the rates can be very challenging. I wonder whether consideration might be given to the idea of a rate-free period for vacant units, particularly in provincial towns and villages, to encourage people to move into them. There are so many empty units in Ireland at present that many of them will not be filled for a long time and some of them may not be filled again. It would be good if the Government were to introduce a measure to encourage people to take on these units and a rate-free period would certainly help. This year, Wexford County Council intends to collect approximately €37 million. I know many people in small businesses in Wexford who do not think much fairness is applied to what they must pay. As long as the local authority needs the money to survive, it cannot go any easier on them. Last year, Wexford County Council wrote off €5 million which it knew it would never get. I am afraid if there is not more flexibility with some customers who are in difficult times they could be added to the list of vacant units. Most people would agree there has been a bit of a lift in the economy in the Dublin area.I admit that in 2014 we saw larger numbers come through our doors, mostly through tourism, as there was an increase in that sector, particularly in the Dublin area, and that was good. Businesses in places such as Wexford are not getting the same boost and that is a major problem. I have not noticed in my lifetime as much of a divide as now exists between the countryside and Dublin. It is almost at a stage where Ireland is Dublin and the rest of the country is a long way behind. I point to the recovery in house prices in the Dublin area compared to Wexford. There has been no movement house prices in Wexford in recent years while there have been dramatic price increases of up to 25% in Dublin. That is a reflection of what is happening in the area. There is far more optimism around Dublin. We depend very much on foreign direct investment for much of the extra work that is coming our way. The days of telling the large foreign corporations that come into the country where to set up their businesses are probably gone. Most of them want to be within the Dublin orbit because it is far more attractive to them. I firmly believe that some day a Government will put much more energy into developing indigenous industry. I am convinced that more can be done in that area. We do not do enough in it. The provinces will continue to struggle until we put far greater energy and investment into creating indigenous industry and helping people with start-ups. It goes back to the old chestnut of where do we get the money and there not being enough of it. We have had that discussion time and again with regard to different areas with different Departments. The fact that we can borrow money at 1.7%, or less sometimes, on the markets in order to do certain things but we are not allowed to do other things and are forced into the hands of the private sector, through public-private partnerships and other different arrangements, where money costs in the range of 15% is very unfortunate. If Europe is to function in the proper spirit of what it was designed to do, that is something that must be addressed. The State should be allowed to borrow money at 1.7% to invest in indigenous industry, infrastructure and in any area that it is needed without driving it into the hands of the private sector which makes a great deal of money out it. That was part of the Lisbon and Nice treaties and it created great opportunities for the private sector to make money through the State. That is holding back many things because we all know that if we had the opportunity to spend more money in these areas, there would be huge benefit all round and there would be a big flipside for everybody. It would have a domino effect and it would make a massive difference. To return to the issue of rates, my main point is that I am inclined to agree with Deputy Fleming, namely, that tying rates to the rental factor would probably give us a fairer system. The only other issue I wish to comment on is that of outsourcing. I was very impressed by the people I met in the Valuation Office and it is unfortunate that they cannot expand their resources to a degree where outsourcing would be unnecessary. If a Department can function well, I do not see the logic of that office outsourcing work in this way. If the office is going to carry out valuations on a regular basis and this is going to continue every five to ten years, there will be a good deal of work in that area. It would make sense to increase the resources in the Valuation Office rather than simply outsourcing the work.

#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	441	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which proposes to amend the existing valuation legislation. There is general agreement that the current system is cumbersome, outdated and inconsistent. Rural Deputies in this House are well aware of the huge decline that has taken place in business, in particular in rural towns and rural areas. Businesses have closed and there are vacant premises in all the towns and villages. While I acknowledge that rates are not the only reason for this, they are a contributing factor. With the older system of county and town councils, it was often the case that rates were higher in small towns and villages than in towns that had their own councils. The abolition of town councils would eventually solve this problem as equalisation would accrue over a seven-year period. However, this process could be too late for many of our smaller towns and villages as, without immediate and remedial action, it is doubtful there will be any rateable properties left in rural areas. Many villages are already without valuable post offices, shops, pubs, cafés etc. Section 11 of this Bill will provide a way of adjusting valuations in these instances which may help some of these businesses to survive. Generally the old system did not take account of the profitability of a business, nor did it allow for revaluation except when a new planning permission was sought. Section 6 provides an amendment which allows the commissioner the option of appointing a person to carry out a valuation on behalf of the Valuation Office. Hopefully, this measure, combined with a self-assessment measure, will hurry up the process and lead to more realistic ways of achieving a just and transparent rate. This will allow new businesses to evaluate more accurately the cost base for rates in advance. This is important as many retail units are being divided into smaller, more manageable units and, under the current system, it is impossible to calculate properly what the rates would be.  This Bill comes from the Seanad and, judging from the transcripts, there was a very successful interaction between Members of the Seanad and the Minister of State, Deputy Harris. I would like in particular to compliment the Seanad and the Minister of State on their handling of amendment No. 24. It acknowledges that sporting or community organisations can rent out their facilities such as all-weather pitches or gyms to local groups without having to pay rates, but like other commercial enterprises any section such a pub, restaurant or catering facility within these premises is not exempt from rates. Child care facilities were considered in detail by the Minister of State and the Seanad and an amendment in this respect was accepted. From now on, a charitable and not-for-profit organisation will be exempt from rates. While I believe that in the future we will have to look at exempting private, for-profit child care facilities, this amendment will now bring welcome relief to approximately 1,000 not-for-profit child care providers. I welcome the Minister of State's constructive contribution to this debate and the amendments he accepted in the Seanad. I am confident that some future improvements can be made to this Bill as it goes through the various Stages in this House. In the meantime, I commend the Bill, together with the amendments made to it in the Seanad, to this House. 
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	442	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It has been coming through the Oireachtas for some time. Obviously the issue of commercial rates is one that is very familiar to anybody who has served on a local authority. As a former member of a local authority for eight years, I found it was a constant source of debate and was very topical in recent years. The Bill modifies the existing system, but there is a valid argument for replacing it with a new system. The difficulty that arises is how we define and draw up a new system. We will always have people who will be winners and losers. People who would be for or against this would find a new system equally problematic and therein lies the problem. Many Members have called for a new system. It is clear that the current system is not properly equipped. Under the 2001 Bill, the last major legislation on this area, it was envisaged that there would a ten-year cycle of valuations, but ten years is a long time, as highlighted by Deputy Wallace.The process started in 2005. Even during a period shorter than ten years, economies rise and fall and there are good times and bad times. A valuation could be made, the economy could plummet the following year, and by the time it rose again one could be in the next valuation period. In the meantime, a business could be significantly affected. The current system has problems. Only three counties have started the process, and only two have completed it, I believe. When the process begins, some will benefit and others will lose, but I understand the overall amount collected in a county will remain the same.  I understand that while there are now 120 valuation staff in the office, there used to be 150. It is quite clear that there is a resourcing issue. Local authorities rely on commercial rates. The Government has broadened the tax base and introduced the local property tax as an alternative source of income. It is to be hoped that, over time, this will allow the burden on businesses to be alleviated.  The Bill has many positive measures. It will simplify the processes, remove the appeal to the commissioner and allow appeals to be dealt with by the valuation tribunal. However, it can only deal with a small number of hearings at any one time, which means it must be properly resourced. Section 6 allows for the appointment of non-valuation office personnel to carry out valuations. It is to be hoped this will minimise delays, but we need to ensure there is consistency within the Valuation Office and across the country. Section 7 permits the publication of a new list of valuations before they come into effect. This will allow people the time to query them and submit appeals. Section 11 provides for the insertion of section 5A, which deals with self-assessment and simplifies the process of administration of valuations, rather than altering the system. Section 22 allows the commissioner to direct the manner in which the net annual value of relevant properties may be estimated.  Overall, I welcome the approach taken. However, as a former councillor I found the only power I had was to increase or reduce the annual rate of valuation, which is a function of councillors. The best international practice takes account of the net annual value or rental value of a property. Pubs, hotels and service stations are valued by reference to the trading data associated with property in that sector.  I am sure this is debated at local authority meetings up and down the country during budget time. We never had the power in law to reduce the net rate for small corner shops or businesses, as compared to large multiples. The attractiveness of being able to reduce rates meant that the larger companies, such as an energy provider which was the largest ratepayer in our county, did not ask for or need a rate reduction. If we had reduced rates for a small corner shop, they would also have been reduced for larger businesses.  Flexibility needs to be given at some stage. That is probably fraught with problems and difficulties, but such an approach is not available under the current law. The law needs to be addressed so that elected members can target benefits to smaller traders and retailers to give them a lifeline in times of recession.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	I thank the Minister of State for bringing the Bill before the House. When we discuss commercial rates and local property tax, it is important that we also discuss where the money is going and how it being spent. People with businesses pay a lot of money on rates in Dublin city, and they often wonder where it goes. One initiative I have tried to pursue for the past number of years is tax transparency at a national level. We have a calculator up and running so that an individual can check how his or her income tax is spent by the Government. It is something we need to compel local authorities to do. If a business could quickly and cheaply get a breakdown online of where its rates are going and how they are spent by the local authority, there might be more buy-in from businesses into what councils are trying to do and the need to pay rates. Many business owners wonder - given the different charges they face, from waste collection to water charges, and the permits for which they pay - where the rates they pay on top of that go. Rates are an importance source of funding for local authorities, but we should tell businesses how it being spent. It is important to have buy-in for the charge. There are a lot of very positive retail trends in the country. We have heard from Retail Ireland that there is expected growth in consumer spending of 2.7%. Retail sales in the last quarter of 2014 were the best since 2007, and Dublin has been voted the fifth best shopping city in the world by Condé Nast. That is all very positive, and if, as I think we have, we have managed to stabilise the economy, perhaps now is the time to consider how we rate businesses in this country and whether there is a better way. We need to examine whether the idea of a fixed charge that is static regardless of how the economy or business is performing is the best pro-enterprise way of making sure that businesses make a fair contribution to the running of the areas in which they are based. We need to ask if something more dynamic can be done. As Deputy Kyne said, we need to ask if we can introduce flexibility so that businesses that need a rate reduction during a particular time or for a particular reason could benefit, while not giving an unnecessary or unneeded benefit to larger businesses working in the area or industry. The Bill could provide such an opportunity. We know from the new valuation process for rates how long it takes to design and implement a new system and the unforeseen delays which might be encountered. If a major change is proposed in, for example, ten years' time, now is the time to start discussing and planning for it. A new process was introduced in Dublin and it was difficult. I attended a number of meetings with local businesses and business associations which were worried. They were not getting clear information and were afraid that their bills would increase. We are still managing that process and there is still a lack of certainty for some businesses. Things could have been done better, but we need to learn from the process as it moves around the country. Some of the exemptions in the Bill are very welcome. Many speakers have mentioned community sports clubs which have a bar, and the exemption from rates for other areas, which is important for clubs. They will be able to put the money they take in into the sporting ground, players, kit or equipment. It is recognised by the Minister of State and the Government that it was unfair for clubs to have to funnel money back into councils. There is an exemption for non-profit nursing homes, which is welcome. There is no exemption for nursing homes which make a profit or are funded through the fair deal scheme. I wonder if we should reconsider that, because we have to do what we can to make health care costs as affordable as possible. We do not want to make it more difficult for people to pay for the health care needs they will have later in life. A similar approach applies to child care facilities. It is welcome that not-for-profit child care facilities are exempt, but for-profit ones are not. Child care is very expensive and this may be a way to provide some relief for such businesses, which could then be passed on to the parents who send their children to such services. The fact that child care facilities are being charged for outdoor areas is interesting. In Ireland, 25% of children under three years of age are overweight. We do not want to disincentivise new or existing child care facilities from using their outdoor areas because they are worried it will cost them more money. We want the opposite; we want as much play and outdoor activity as possible, because that is best for children. It is something that we may be able to examine at a later stage. I welcome the Bill, which is important.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	444	I welcome this important Bill and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, on its introduction to the House. The Bill has been debated by many Deputies and local authorities throughout the country. I have a particular interest in certain aspects of the Bill.I was pleased to see that a number of amendments dear to my heart were included by our colleagues in the Seanad. There are a number of aspects of the Bill which I welcome. This legislation will create a much fairer playing field for town centres and out-of-town retailers. Walking down the main street of Longford town, it would be clear to anyone that business is being affected by retail parks on the outskirts of town, excessive car parking charges and reduced consumer spending. Town centres have consistently suffered over recent years and a great deal of work needs to be done if they are to survive. For a number of years I have being calling on some form of Government strategy to be brought forward that would support business growth and job creation in our town centres. We have the report from the commission for the economic development of rural areas, which was prepared by Mr. Pat Spillane and launched with great publicity by the Taoiseach in Castlebar last year. We need a decent allocation of funding to implement the recommendations of the report. I know that approximately €1 million was allocated in the 2015 budget for the establishment of a rural innovation development fund to support ideas on a pilot basis under this report. This legislation is a small step in that direction but we must do much more to bring town centres to a certain standard. This Bill seeks to address the inequality that exists between town centres and out-of-town developments. Under the current system, commercial rates are not charged on the provision of out-of-town retail car parks. As a result of this, there is absolutely no incentive for retail parks to charge for these parking spaces. This legislation will seek to address this issue by applying a rate on the retailers. This rate is to be based on the revenue that would be generated by the space of the same parking charges in any nearby urban area. The benefit of this approach is clear, and local authorities will receive extra revenue while at the same time allowing large corporate retailers to make a contribution to the local economy. It is also a wise move to ensure that parking spaces for customers will be taken into account when valuing a shop or retail outlet. All of these provisions will work towards levelling the playing field between our town centres and the large out-of-town retail parks. Another important aspect of this Bill involves sports clubs. We can all outline the valuable role sports clubs and sport play in our local communities and this Bill introduces a new exemption for community sports facilities. The first part of the exemption replicates the current interpretation of the "community hall" exemption. Essentially, if the sports club does not have a bar, all of its premises would be exempt from rates. The second part of the exemption is for sports clubs that have bar facilities. As it stands, if a sports club has a bar, all of its premises is valued for rates purposes, including buildings that are solely for a sporting use. This is very unfair and many sports clubs, particularly in rural Ireland, have been hit hard as a result. The amending Bill being put forward today will ensure that the parts of a sports club which generate income, such as the bar, will be liable for rates, and not the entire premises. This is a common-sense approach and it should have been implemented long ago. Yesterday, I spoke in this House on the Private Members' motion regarding child care services and I am very pleased to see there is provision in this Bill to exempt premises used for non-profit early childhood care and education. However, I strongly feel that some exemption should be provided for privately run child care facilities, which amount to approximately 70% of the total number of facilities. If this is enacted, it will essentially mean that organisations that provide child care for charitable purposes will be exempt from rates. As the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, has pointed out, this amendment will exempt up to 1,000 charitable child care providers from liability for commercial rates. This Bill is proportionate and necessary legislation. It improves the current standing of sports clubs, child care facilities and town centres, so I commend the Minister of State on his initiative and ability to steer this legislation through both Houses.

If we are to be honest, it could be renamed "the rearranging of deckchairs on the Titanic Bill". As a country, we must face the fact that our current rates system and this tax on businesses is wrong and utterly inefficient. It is a tax on enterprise and job creation for which nothing is repaid. It is a basic funding mechanism for local government, and it is time we faced the fact that we must come up with a new way of doing this. It should be less harsh with a focus on a society with the capacity to create jobs and wealth in the economy. The current system represents a modern form of highway robbery. It is the old way of people paying a bill, with dubious returns. If a business is in a town or city centre, it would get street lights and cleaning in return, but we would really begin to run out of rope after that in the provision of services. The business must pay for water coming in and going out, as well as electricity and other services. If a business is in a business improvement district, it would pay rates and something extra for the district. These districts have seen some really good work throughout the country, but this is an extra charge on top of rates. Deputy Eoghan Murphy made a very good point about how we bill for rates. A demand goes out for a bizarre amount, with no breakdown of the total or indication of how the money is allocated. For many local authorities, there is no way of saying where the money is going. It might be going to salaries and wages or services that may not be relevant or of benefit to the business community. It is an authority's only real source of funding, and it comes from the business community. The anti-enterprise focus of the rates system was best summed up to me in Roscommon last October when I met a business owner who had a business premises in Carrick-on-Shannon that was performing very well, employing ten people. He opened a second branch of the same business on the Roscommon side of Athlone. The first letter he got from Roscommon County Council was not a welcome or a "thank you" for creating six jobs and it did not outline what the Roscommon local enterprise office could do for him. It was not a request to meet the business owner. Instead, it was a rates bill for €6,500 and a request to pay within 30 days. It would have been too much for the letter to have "please" at the end and I am sure the recipient could not ask what the money was for. That constrained the entrepreneur's ability to create employment that might have taken somebody from the live register and given a person some sort of start. As the phrase goes, we are where we are. We have a Bill, and in fairness to the Minister of State, there are some elements that must be welcomed. I welcome the sports club element, for example, which is important, and the element relating to child care centres, as we have discussed over the past two days. We must reconsider the whole revaluation process. It is a good idea in theory but it has struck fear into business communities throughout the country. It was drawn to my attention that in parts of Waterford city that had seen necessary regeneration from private enterprise, the first thing received by businesses was a revaluation, with rates having quadrupled in some cases. This happened because people took the initiative to reinvest in and upgrade premises, trying to make the city centre a better place to go. There are places in the country that need that kind of initiative and investment, but when one considers the cost, one might be able to cover the upgrade but the additional expense of a rates revaluation - dead money - makes the concept uneven.As a result, many people are turned off doing it. We must give flexibility to local authorities to enable them to encourage people, through rates incentives, to upgrade their buildings and businesses. We must confront the fact that rates are a tax that will soon go out of fashion and will be unpayable. As businesses and people increasingly go online to make their purchases, they are often purchasing products from outside the jurisdiction from people who do not have to pay rates or, in many cases, VAT, although that is a separate discussion. They are buying the product at a cheaper price because the cost base of the online retailer is so much less, yet we still enforce this system for retailers who are struggling to keep the show on the road and who will not see what they are getting for it. Deputy Bannon spoke about the need for town and area renewal. He is absolutely correct. One does not even have to leave this city to see town centres in parts of the suburbs that are dying, having once thrived, because people are going online to shop or going to the big shopping centres. While this Bill goes some way towards rebalancing the discrimination that exists against our traditional centres, it is far short of what is needed. What is required is a complete re-imagining of the way in which we tax business and fund local authorities. Our town centres must survive and thrive. They are essential elements of a modern society in terms of cohesion - a place for people to do business and to mix and gather. At present, in many town centres neither business owners nor local authorities have the resources to make the necessary investment. There must be a system of encouragement, through the rates and the local authorities, to allow investment to happen without the investors being penalised. When one makes an investment in one's premises, one is immediately penalised because it is upgraded in value, and the local authorities will pursue the person, as they must, with a bigger rates bill. That is not the way it should be done. We should encourage and reward upgrading and investment, rather than automatically penalising it. Perhaps the case should be made that those who leave their buildings in a derelict state, despite all the work under way by councils with derelict site regulations, should be penalised in their rates for the damage they are doing, rather than those who make the effort to upgrade their premises. The issue of what businesses get for rates has not been clarified. There is never an effort on the part of the Department or local government to tell businesses exactly what they are funding or what work the local authority is doing. My local authority in Mayo, like many other local authorities, has an economic and investment unit. It does superb work. The unit is funded through rates, yet that connection is not made. If rates from a business in a rural area are funding street lighting, the lights might as well be on Mars because there is no public lighting in rural areas. There should be a direct contribution from rates to the upgrading of broadband services. A connection should be made between the rates income and road upgrades. There is no sense in telling businesses in a rural area that the rates go towards cleaning when the cleaning does not happen. Furthermore, under the new system of local government après the abolition of town councils, cleaning and road sweeping machines are becoming a much rarer sight in main towns that formerly had town councils. Previously, the council could show the ratepayer that their money was going on cleaning the streets. Now, one would be lucky to see a street cleaning machine twice or three times per quarter, due to the length and breadth of the new municipal areas that must be serviced. That is another service that has been diminished. Councils have funded, and are always good at, various tourism and business growth initiatives. That comes from rates, and that must be explained too. The notion of sending a demand in the 21st century must be abolished. Councils have to realise that rates are a major source of expenditure for businesses, and businesses should be told what they are getting for every cent. In the amendments to be introduced by the Minister, perhaps a requirement could be applied to councils when they send out the demand - it is not even an invoice, but a demand - to provide a breakdown of where the money goes, what services were provided and how the council can assist the business. One must still almost beg the council to allow payment of the rates to be spread over 12 months. Payment plans vary from council to council and from office to office. Some type of flexibility must be provided for the payment of this major expense, just as one gets flexibility from utility companies in paying other big bills. The other issue is the existing rate on a building that has been empty but that a new business wishes to occupy. It sums up how weak and out-of-date this legislation is. If one has a business idea, is lucky enough to get the finance together and finds a premises, one is hit immediately with a legacy debt on the building. This happens all over the country and particularly in the hotel sector, where small hotels have hit the wall in the last few years. Approaches might be made to try to get them operating again, but the people are hit by legacy utility and rates bills. In fairness to many of the utility companies, they will deal with the person about the bills, but the rates bill is the one that is dragging many new businesses down. I realise there are areas of displacement and that there are challenges regarding competition and what other businesses can do, but we must have some type of culture whereby the State encourages somebody to set up a business and promises not to put blockages in the way. The current rates system is the major factor blocking many start-up businesses from getting up and running. The notion that one must pick up the local authority bill of somebody who previously had the building but has left it is wrong, and it is blocking movement on properties around the country. I do not know how long the Minister will be in office but I expect he will be there for a while. This is a system that must be re-imagined. Somebody needs to lob a grenade into it, blow it up and rebuild it. It is a system that is anti-enterprise and anti-employment. It penalises those we depend on to pay the rates. Their input into how the system works is restricted, as is their input into how we change it, and much of it is never taken on board. If we are to have an enterprise-led culture and to be the best country in the world in which to do business by 2016, as the Taoiseach regularly tells us, this system must change. It is the biggest drag on small business in the country at present, and if we are to be the best country in the world in which to do business, we must get rid of the highway robbery that is our current rates system.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	446	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation regarding a matter that has been the focus of conversation in most of our towns, villages and cities for the last 20 years or more. I agree with the issues raised by the last speakers regarding charities and sports clubs. The rates should be restricted to the commercial use and should not be extended beyond that. Deputy Calleary raised the very interesting point of legacy debt. That is not legally enforceable. One cannot force somebody to pay the debt of a previous occupant. I realise some local authorities do that, but not all of them. It amounts to a scheming way of effectively preventing any enterprise from going into a vacant building. Rates are the one issue that affects the commercial life of our towns and villages. They affect the hotel, pub, catering and administrative sectors. Everything that is likely to be located in the centre of a town or village is dramatically affected in a negative way by the level of rates, and the rates are automatically affected by the valuation system. How the valuation system applies in a particular area is totally random. It looks as though somebody has stuck a pin in a map and stated what level of commercial activity would be likely to take place in that area, and businesses are penalised because their commercially generated activity is not sufficient to fund it. It is a case of "Tough luck." I hope the Bill will take account of the need to balance the extent to which a particular enterprise is capable of raising revenue with somebody's desktop assessment of what that should be.Like actual practice and tasting the soup, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. I have not had a chance to study this sufficiently, but I would suggest that after a period of six months or a year there would be a review to see the extent to which the enterprise in question is capable of surviving in a particular location, given its footfall and revenue-generating capacity. There is no other way to do it.  I apologise to economists all over the country and the world for what I am about to say. I have to apologise for this on a regular basis. However, if one were to assume the various contradictory opinions of the economists and apply them to the level of commercial activity likely to be generated in certain areas throughout the country, there would be many differing views. A means has to be found which will somehow level the playing pitch and enable an entrepreneur setting up in a town or village, giving employment and providing a useful service, to do so without fear of a major slice of his or her income being taken away in rates before getting started. A hotel - not the biggest one in the world - can expect to spend €300,000 to €400,000 in rates before the doors are opened at all. There is nothing unusual about this. The nearer to the capital city, the worse this gets. Some hotels and commercial premises in the regions are heavily penalised in the same way.  The need for variation needs to be incorporated into the system which determines the level of rates, but it needs to be refined. Some measure has to be taken. There used to be a rule of thumb on this where someone would tell a ratepayer that, on the basis of the size of the premises, it would, in theory, generate a certain amount of revenue a year. How in God's name could that happen? There is no way that anyone can do this, unless the ratepayer is cutting diamonds or something like this and it could be assumed there would be a certain high level of commercial activity. There is a huge variation in the degree to which revenue can be generated by various activities. In many cases it is necessary to locate enterprises in the centre of a town or village. If located in a remote rural area, they will not have the necessary footfall and will not survive. Some industries can survive in such circumstances but others cannot.  I have been around long enough to remember previous valuations. I always had a great deal of hope when a review of valuations took place, but, after the review, in some places things were worse than they had been. Some people had a massive increase in the rates burden as a result of the review. I do not know how the people concerned managed to come up with a valuation which could do such a thing. We still live in straitened times and, notwithstanding the recovery, there needs to be some degree of uniformity across the country, with checks and balances, in order to ensure the burden is within the capacity of the commercial operator.  Other speakers referred to the growth of multinational supermarkets and corporations and its killing of the centres of towns and villages across the country. This is a fact. The other thing which kills the centre of towns and villages, along with rates, is a lack of parking. When a person arrives in a town now the first thing he or she will recognise is that, if in a car, he or she is not welcome. The idea, presumably, is that a person would arrive by balloon or hang-glider and descend onto the middle of the main street of the town or village and hope that he or she will ascend into the heavens thereafter when wishing to leave. It does not work this way. We have to encourage the development of our towns and villages - there is more than one element to this - by giving a clear indication to shoppers and consumers that they are welcome. They should be invited in, treated well and provided with a parking space. I will not digress any further on that. Incidentally, I have never understood modern carparks. I can never understand why someone does not put a commercial premises on top of them, such as a revolving restaurant, as is done in other countries. It appears not to be possible here. I cannot understand why there is this lack of flair.

I wish to emphasise the importance of the impact of rates. It would be a huge boost to the commercial activity in our towns and villages if, as a result of this review of the valuations, there was a reduction in rates. There is no use in having it any other way. There are competing demands affecting the commercial sector. If, as a result of this, there is an increase in rates, there will be two effects. It will demoralise people and it will negatively impact the sector. There are other competing factors. We had upward only rent reviews in the commercial sector. Do Members remember this? Some genius thought up this some years ago. I have always believed them to be unconstitutional and that, if practised on a large scale, they would ultimately undermine the budget of the State, which they did. To my knowledge, they are illegal now. The practice, in general, has been hugely detrimental. If people are facing bills from rates and should they in the future face an upward only rent review, the income of the entrepreneur, householder, investor, shopkeeper or launderette will be controlled by factors outside of their control. It must be remembered that only a certain amount of activity can be generated within a particular space. This needs to be borne in mind when considering the measurement of the properties. One of the oldest difficulties we have relates to planning permission and a change of use. Let us take, for instance, a pub. It is to be hoped that pubs will improve, but it must also be remembered that they have provided a social service to communities. One classic example is where the owners of a pub decide to put in a restaurant upstairs. Someone does a head count and bingo, up go the rates straight away. Whatever hope the owners have of operating on the basis of the existing commercial premises, out of which they were barely able to eke an existence, if they decide to be enterprising and to provide jobs for people in the locality, they are put down very quickly. There is an extra supercharge on the rates and this defeats them.  The biggest single deterrent in terms of commercial activity in our towns and villages brought to my attention over the past nine or ten years, but particularly during the economic crisis, is without a doubt the rating system and its impact on business and enterprise.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	454	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill. I, like many of my colleagues, welcome the debate. We all need to deal with valuation in the context of a modern and changing economic worry. Land and property must be managed in such a way that broader society does not suffer and people with small business who want to hire a few extra staff are not hammered by commercial rates. We need to wake up to these harsh realities.I will come back to deal with these matters later in the legislative process. I welcome the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 in so far as it seeks to introduce a number of measures to speed up the valuation process. We have to deal with the changing situation. In addition, the Bill introduces a number of other changes that reflect the lessons learned over the past decade from the operation of the Valuation Act 2001. This debate is also about the current valuation system, the revaluation process and the implications of the changes that this Bill proposes to introduce. That is why it is important for us to get the broader debate right. Over the years, a number of councils have had difficulties collecting commercial rates. According to the information available to us at the moment, which relates to 2010, the average amount collected in that year was 77.7% of the total due. This was down from 82.8% in 2009. I believe the county councils in Donegal, Waterford and Louth and the city councils in Galway and Limerick had the lowest collection rates. Between 61% and 65% of the total due was collected in those areas. Limerick County Council had the highest collection rate, with 90% of rates due collected in 2010. Many councils cited the poor economic conditions and the lack of access to credit for businesses as reasons for their low collection rates. We all understand the commercial reality for many people, particularly during the bad few years when the economy was being hammered, situations were really getting out of control and businesses were under major pressure. We have to face the reality when it comes to commercial rates. If an entrepreneur with a small business who employs between eight and 14 people is deciding whether to take on an extra staff member, his or her decision might be influenced by the receipt of a huge commercial rates bill of €50,000 or €60,000. I just think that is something we have to look at seriously. A number of concerns have been expressed about the Bill before the House. The first one I would like to focus on relates to outsourcing. The Bill proposes that the Commissioner of Valuation be empowered to contract out valuations with regard to the revaluation of all properties on a valuation list. Currently, the revaluation of a property on a valuation list is done by the commissioner's office under the guidance of the Commissioner of Valuation. Section 6 of this Bill would allow this work to be outsourced to a person outside the Valuation Office. My concerns are largely based on the reality of what is actually happening out there. The argument made from some people's point of view is that outsourcing the revaluation of all property on a valuation list could speed up the process and perhaps cost less. However, I would like the Minister and the Government to look closely at the many risks that would be involved in such a change. There are concerns about risks that might be associated with outsourcing, including loss of control; differences in motivation, goals and attitudes between the internal staff and the employees of outsource companies; the viability of service providers; the quality of services; a lack of expertise; and the hidden and uncertain costs. In addition, there are possible conflicts of interest. I ask the Minister to look at the situation to ensure a bit of common sense is applied when dealing with what is going on in the world today. The Bill removes the right to appeal a valuation decision - a revaluation or a revision - to the Commissioner of Valuation. The current procedure involves an initial decision on the valuation of a property for rates purposes. Then there is a period of consultation with the owner or occupier on this decision before a final decision is made by the Valuation Office. The owner or occupier can then appeal this final valuation to the Commissioner of Valuation. If the owner or occupier is unhappy with the commissioner's decision, he or she can appeal that decision to the Valuation Tribunal. Such a decision can only be appealed to the High Court on a point of law. The Bill proposes that appeals to the Commissioner of Valuation be removed and all appeals be moved directly to the Valuation Tribunal. This is my third concern about the legislation. I would like to return to a broader issue that I mentioned earlier. I refer to the connection between high commercial rates and the impact on small businesses in the SME sector. I could give examples of small businesses employing seven, eight or nine people that are being hammered by high commercial rates. The most recent figures that were released in this country show they are particularly high. We need this tranche of finances. It is important to note that commercial rates are generally expected to raise at least €1.46 billion in revenue for local authorities. This is approximately one third of the overall revenue. Business groups - I am focusing particularly on small business groups - have been calling for the rating system to be reformed to allow valuations to vary with the economic circumstances of a firm. One downside of such a change is that it could undermine the system of valuation, which is based on valuations of property in the area on a specific date. It is important that we raise these issues because they are essential. I would like to go back again to the Bill itself. It seeks to introduce a number of measures to speed up the revaluation process - for example, by allowing this work to be outsourced, allowing it to be completed by self-assessment, removing the route of appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation on a revaluation decision, modifying slightly the scope of the property to be revalued and allowing valuations to be determined by the use of general market data coupled with statistical techniques. On 29 January last, I asked the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government if he would support the introduction of the small business rate relief scheme to assist small businesses in 2015. I got this idea after I heard about a proposal that was being made by a number of people I know who are directly involved in the sector. A small business rate relief scheme could be of assistance. The Government regularly claims to be all about jobs, jobs, jobs and the economy. I think this would help to kick-start things. In his response to me, the Minister said:Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. ... I would consider carefully any application received for a rate waiver scheme. In considering any such application, it has to be borne in mind that a waiver of rates for one class of ratepayer could unfairly impact on existing businesses in the area.In fairness to the Minister, he went on to say he would "continue to keep commercial rates related issues under consideration". I think he needs to up his game by doing something to help the people out there who are suffering. Small businesses are coming under a great deal of pressure. I would like to refer to a number of other changes that are being made in this legislation. It is proposed to increase the penalties for most offences under this legislation to class A fines of €5,000 from class C fines of €2,500. Interestingly enough, the fine for an ongoing breach upon summary conviction has been reduced from a daily class E fine of €500 to a daily fine of up to €300. It is important that we look at some of the ideas and concerns that are raised in today's debate. I am glad to have had a chance to record my support for the small business sector in this State. We need to give it a leg up to ensure it can survive in the economy of the next couple of years.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	455	I thank Deputy Finian McGrath for sharing his time with me. The issue of rates is and has always been a huge one for the vast array of small business people up and down the country. Rates were on land up to 1977. They were always paid. I suppose it was a retrograde step to take them off fully. Now we have moved on to a whole new situation of business. The boom drove the valuations that were put on businesses mad. Then we had the bust.However, there has been no connection between the ability of small businesses to pay rates and their turnover. These must be linked in some way. I am disappointed in the Bill because it does not get to the nub of the matter. Most people whom I know try their best, as do the county officials in the former South Tipperary County Council, which has been amalgamated into the county. Money is banked in Nenagh, but the north Tipperary county manager does a smash-and-grab and takes everything out of south Tipperary. However, that matter is not for today. People who are paying rates in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Cahir and the smaller villages are being charged for everything, but they are getting no services in return - not a morsel of salt in the frost or snow. There are no council staff on the ground to assist them in any way. Since they have also paid water rates for years, many of them cringe to see the furore over attempts to charge for water. In south County Tipperary, 97% of water rates were collected. I thank the rent and rate collectors and, above all, the ratepayers who have paid for services for decades. However, many new businesses have had to pay development levies when applying for planning permission. Even though they pay water rates, they must pay for a water connection as well. I thank the staff of the Valuation Office with whom I deal because they are understanding and helpful, but there are not enough of them and they have too much work to do. As such, I welcome the Bill's section on appointing external individuals to conduct revaluations under strict guidance. People should not have to wait and appeal. The process is expensive, cumbersome and too slow. Section 2 provides for a new definition and for deletions, substitutions and extensions of existing definitions in the 2001 Act. The section redefines "rating authority" to provide for the revaluation of fisheries. The Bill's ethos is important, but we have not got it right. I am not saying I am an expert, good or bad, and we can look forward to a better economic climate than the one we are in, but people have been struggling and forking out significant amounts of money regardless of turnover or of the ability of self-employed people, including myself, to create jobs and a better environment for their communities through their taxes and the PRSI contributions they make for their employees. There must be some connectivity. This Bill is timely, but I would prefer if it were not passed at all, and I will vote against it because it is not right in many respects. We should take more time to develop a better understanding. I am not being critical of the staff of the Bills Office or whoever drafts Bills, but I often wonder whether they understand the issues they are dealing with. Why not have a forum in which ratepayers can have an input into the Bill and the system? I listened with interest to Deputy Wallace's comments on business rates in Dublin, including for his restaurant. He said that even its kitchen area is subject to a high rate because it is deemed a premium market space, being at the front so that customers can see where the food is cooked. Although vital business is being done there, one cannot make sales out of the kitchen. What is produced in the kitchen brings in all the sales, but the area cannot be used for seating. In the towns that I represent in Tipperary, restaurants want to create a nice ambience for passers-by and get people to stop by putting tables and chairs on the footpaths, but there has been holy war with the council over it. Restaurants are levied straight away and the spaces are measured in square milli-inches. It is punitive and regressive, but the Bill does not address this matter either. Businesses should be encouraged to make their streets friendly for pedestrians so that people might sit and eat when we get the weather. We had a wonderful summer last year. So far, this winter has been good as well. It is lovely to see people sitting outside, eating food and talking with passers-by. A person I have dealt with received a letter from the area engineer or the like claiming that the person had broken the law. This matter should have been examined in the Bill. Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, are the economy's backbone. During Question Time this morning, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, talked about IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland attracting companies to small rural towns. They are not going to those towns because there is no proper connectivity in terms of broadband and so on. We depend on SMEs, the generators of wealth. People have ideas and they source support, which is difficult to do, set up and develop businesses, work all the hours God gives them and try to create jobs and, thereby, wealth and better communities. When their rates bills arrive, though, they are crucified. They cannot pay. I am not saying they will not pay anything, as they want to pay, but there must be a system of instalments. The councils work on that front as best they can, but they need support and a dig-out. A great deal more research should have been done in this amending legislation, given how vital it is. Section 17 amends the grounds on which an appeal to the tribunal may be made and provides that reference must be made to comparable properties. Where no comparable property exists, the appellant is required to submit a valuation determined by reference to the valuation levels of other properties stated in the valuation list. That is all fine and dandy, but it is not as easy as it says on the tin. What if there is no comparable business? A constituent of mine who was assessed six months or a year ago is in negotiations with the Valuation Office seeking an appeal. He has no industry with which to compare. The nearest comparable business has a much lower valuation than he does. I am concerned by the seeming and deep unfairness of this. I welcome the fact that the office will get more staff on strict conditions of employment relating to, for example, confidentiality and leaking information. If there are misdemeanours, staff can be dismissed or replaced by other private sector employees under the strict terms and conditions set out in the Bill. I am disappointed that there was not a more exhaustive examination. I have spoken with the chambers of commerce and small business organisations and held a forum to speak with SMEs, which are at the pin of their collar paying these rates and levies but are getting no supports in return. They paid willingly when they were able, but turnover has vanished in many cases. Others who must leave a place unoccupied must first pay their rates and then use letters of advertisement from auctioneers, for example, to prove that it was unoccupied so that they can get that money back. This is a regressive and unfair system and should be examined in more detail.

He was extremely helpful in terms of understanding the workings of that office when he came before the Committee of Public Accounts. He has given great service to the State and extended that service by doing the work, as he did, without pay. I welcome the introduction of the Bill. One has to go to the very end of it, however, to understand what it is setting out to do, which is to strengthen the numbers in the Valuation Office and provide appropriate IT structures for the work to be undertaken. In addition, there are various sections which essentially refer to the office itself and what the commissioner shall or shall not be able to do. My main concern about the legislation is that it does not go far enough. It does not deal with the issues that are being faced today by businesses throughout the country. The cost of creating a job through the IDA runs to roughly €13,000, but at one time SMEs created close to 1 million jobs. They tailored all their costs, cut back where necessary and ensured that they were competitive. The one single cost they could not cut back on, however, concerned rates. Regardless of their turnover or the challenges they faced, particularly from 2007 onwards right up to today, they were unable to cut the cost of commercial rates. It indicates that those involved in creating jobs in the SME sector - small businesses run by families or individuals, that are central to our economic recovery - were, by and large, ignored. They were not assisted either by central government or local government. That is a reflection of the State's attitude to collecting taxes, because this is a tax that has no bearing on turnover or one's ability to pay. It is simply a direct extraction of money from businesses into local authority coffers. I would like to see that situation being changed. The activities of the Valuation Office in terms of the revaluation process have clearly shown that it would take decades to complete what is necessary throughout the country. The starting point is that regardless of what happens in a county, whether the rate on particular businesses goes up or down, the take from the process must be the same. The concern for bureaucracy in local government means that while the take in 2013 was €1.47 billion, it cannot be reduced in any significant way. Whatever is done, therefore, nothing will be done about that amount. All that is happening is that pieces are being shifted around the board. Those pieces represent businesses run by families or individuals who are under pressure to continue paying a rate that is above and beyond the demands that should be made on them. Most of the newly constructed premises came about from 2007 onwards when massive construction took place. Rates applied to those buildings reflected the values of the properties at that time, as well as commercial activity and the ability of those within the business sector to pay. They are still paying the same level of rates. Unless local authorities understand what is going on in the SME sector, they will continue to pursue businesses for 100% of that rate. Some local authorities have engaged with the business sector. They have reduced the rate on buildings by an amount equal to the space that is not being used. However, there is an argument for them to do even more because businesses are still unable to pay. It is not only about the space being used, therefore, but also about profits made and an ability to pay rates. The subsequent occupier clause has been another area of contention over the years. Properties remained vacant because outstanding rates could not be sorted out, so the landlord owed the rates or was left with the rates bill after a tenant moved out. Those rates stayed in demand as far as the council was concerned and because of that legal issue, properties were neglected and not let. This shows a clear misunderstanding of the SME sector. That needs to be said loud and clear because if we are to get any change, it must be based on a business's performance and ability to pay. Why should a local authority have within its power the ability to take €1.47 billion in 2013, yet have absolutely no intention of examining whether a company, be it run by a family or an individual, can pay those rates? It should be remembered that they are paying taxes as well as creating employment. This sector has been considered a soft touch for too long, so the rates system needs to be taken asunder and explored. It is essential to have a greater recognition of one's ability to pay. Other aspects of rates are also a cause for concern. If one was lucky, in the course of better times, to build an extension to one's premises or refurbish it, as well as taking the risk to create employment or introduce new services, the first thing that happened after getting planning permission, having paid fees and all the other charges imposed by a local authority, was a rate assessment. A person who just trundled on in their business, doing little but having a turnover, paid a lower level of rates than an entrepreneur creating jobs. The latter was penalised by the taxation system through the commercial rates reassessment. The biggest single issue in the country today, as outlined yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Troy, is the cost of child care and keeping crèches open to enable people to return to work. Sometimes they go back to work to service a mortgage. In most if not all cases, however, it is a question of servicing debt caused by mortgages or other obligations. The State should understand that servicing personal debt is causing difficulties within families who must pay large sums of money for child care. That issue could be dealt with by simply exempting all these educational centres from the payment of rates. Such action by the State would be recognised by that sector concerning the costs involved, which are borne by parents who are making a genuine effort. The same could be said of sporting organisations. What does the Minister of State intend to do with a sporting centre, a club or licensed organisation that has become a community centre?We have devastated rural areas by supporting policies which lead to the closure of local pubs, grocery stores and post offices. There is nothing left in some villages other than local GAA clubs, in the main, or other sports clubs. The clubs in question have availed of grants and made every effort to galvanise communities, particularly children, who represent the next generation, by providing some social activity that will assist in rebuilding structures within those communities. The general properties owned by such clubs should be exempt from rates. If there is a bar on the premises, perhaps there should be a special consideration in respect of it. Those who will argue against everything I have said will do so on the basis that doing as I suggest would result in the State's tax take being reduced. We are asking that, in the context of commercial rates, the tax take should be reduced. Let us not be afraid to confront that particular matter. The tax take should be reduced on the basis that local business are being pushed to the wall as a result of the amount of tax they are obliged to pay. These businesses create and sustain jobs and they are often run by families whose members work way beyond what is required of them to keep local community enterprises in operation. They lie at the very heart of communities and they keep going to provide people with both hope and access to services. The position in Ireland has changed because many villages and towns have been devastated. I am of the view that commercial rates are part of the problem in this regard. They are not the only factor but they are certainly a great cause for concern, especially for local businesses. Another issue to which I wish to refer is the local government audit. If savings were made in how local government is administered and if responsibility for deciding on commercial rates was really left with local authorities, then it would be possible for the authorities to stimulate local economies by being able to take the political decision to reduce the level of those rates. That would be a good development because it would return the power of valuation, regardless of whether this was on the basis of self-valuation, and the ability to strike rates to bodies of individuals elected by the people. Those bodies would then be in a position to deal directly with the demands of local economies. For many years, this House has discussed the reform that is necessary in local government. Let us amend the legislation before us and give local authorities the ability to make all of the changes that are necessary, including those relating to commercial rates. Most of what is proposed in respect of this matter is compiled by bureaucrats and put before local authorities as a done deal. Those authorities cannot then walk away from what is proposed. They must either accept or reject it. How many groups were consulted in respect of the legislation before the House? How many business people, large or small, were asked to outline their views and indicate how they would change the legislation, especially to make it better, expand it or ensure that it might deal in more general terms with the question of commercial rates? It must be remembered that in addition to those rates, water charges are also being imposed by local authorities. The rate in respect of such charges is €3 per cubic metre of water in and water out. This means that everything is being pushed onto local businesses. Those who intend to support the legislation should ask about the number of inspections to which businesses are subjected at present. They are certainly liable to inspection by the Health and Safety Authority and the HSE. Depending on the type of activity in which they are involved, businesses can also be subject to many other inspections, including those by the Revenue and, dare I say it, the National Employment Rights Authority. That is what businesses are obliged to deal with and they object to it on the basis that they are not being consulted. They also object because it is they who pay the greatest amount of tax and who create jobs. Occasionally, some of those involved in SMEs do this by investing their own personal funds because all of the costs relating to the business are not covered by its income. The difficulty is that there are those in this House who do not understand what I have just outlined. Regardless of how we appeal to the Government of the day, and I did so when my party was in power, there remains very little understanding of what is involved in creating and maintaining a small business. The Bill before us illustrates that this lack of understanding continues to obtain. Any reform introduced in this House is based on how much the State receives at present and the need to ensure that its take will not be reduced by the proposed reform. The issue is that the State is taking too much from businesses while simultaneously informing their owners that we are relying on them to rebuild the economy and create employment. There is a contradiction in the Bill which must be confronted. Will the Minister of State and the Cabinet confront that contradiction and discuss matters with those in the SME sector in the interests of coming up with something that is fairer, more equitable and based on people's ability to pay? The amounts people are expected to pay in respect of leases and rates are phenomenal. Before those in government were elected, they gave a commitment to end upward-only rent reviews. No one in this House said anything when Bewley's, which was the subject of an upward-only rent arrangement, was obliged to close with the loss of more than 100 jobs. How long did it take to create that enterprise and how many millions did it take to maintain it? Bewley's is just one example of a business that was allowed to close. Some of the properties leased by Bewley's and companies like it are often owned by banks or pension funds and these are untouchable. I appeal to the Minister of State to reach out and touch them and to break the stranglehold of the upward-only rent review clause. Every other landlord in the country has been obliged to reduce rents to retain tenants. Some of them have been successful in this regard. Current practice in respect of tenants such as Bewley's and the many other companies to which reference has been made is to keep them in operation at the premises they lease and screw them for the highest amount of rent possible. Certain landlords are able to do this on the basis of leasing arrangements which are, quite frankly, immoral. The Government stated that it would take action on this matter and it is past time for it to intervene and resolve it, once and for all, before more of our high street enterprises are forced out of business. That is the eventuality we face. Many businesses in urban areas throughout the country have been obliged to close as a result of the challenges with which they were presented. If one drives down the street in any village, town or city, one will find nothing but pubs, post offices and small shops that have been boarded up. We need to do something to reignite rural areas. This would partly involve an understanding on the part of local and central government that something needs to be done about rates, upward-only rent reviews and any other issue that confronts SMEs to encourage them to employ more and stay in business.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	457	I welcome this debate because a great deal of sense is being spoken on all sides of the House. The debate really resonates with people connected to small businesses and rural towns in particular. There are a number of issues that I would like to address, one of which is upward-only rent reviews, ironically. The previous speaker said that something needs to be done, the most infamous words of this House. I would prefer to have a couple of proposals and, to that end, I am going to make a couple of recommendations, which I hope the civil servants will try to take on board. I agree with the concept of taking ability to pay into account. Three factors arise in this regard. First, one could consider the percentage of turnover of a business. Second, one could consider its number of employees and, third, one could examine its profitability or liquid assets. In this regard, big businesses have the capacity to make far higher profits than SMEs which do not have the core competencies they are competing with in locations such as shopping centres, in particular. I admit to being a ratepayer and having a business in a shopping centre, but I wear a neutral hat regarding this matter. I prefer to see SMEs developing and also getting into a position in which landlords and tenants have a relationship that promotes the occupation of empty buildings in every town, village and city. There ought to be a perspective on how a building contributes aesthetically to the well-being of its entire neighbourhood. Unfortunately, there are at present many dormant buildings that are not being used; their landlords are sitting on them. Some landlords with three or four shops in a town might have one vacant but will not rent it until they get the market rent. Therefore, they are in some control over what they seek to achieve. Many cities throughout Europe require the payment of rates on buildings that are not being used. The rate is less than for used buildings but the owner must pay a contribution towards the well-being of the entire area and is compelled to maintain the building aesthetically, at a level higher than obtains currently in our local authority areas, where there are buildings dragging down the aesthetic standard. This is a good model on many fronts and it could be used against a charge on the property in the event that it is eventually sold on or somebody does not currently have the capacity to do something with it. It recognises the fact that many small and medium-sized businesses are not in a position to enter into leases or take on the rates with immediate effect. If there were a lowering of the rates and the overall rent applicable, since the supply would increase dramatically, businesses and business opportunities would become more viable. Let me develop another couple of ideas. There are many places throughout the country with redundant buildings that are outdated, yet the banks are not in a position to put finance in place for people to convert them into turnkey operations that would attract businesses. We are now launching - thanks be to God - the rural regeneration programme and the Action Plan for Jobs. There was a welcome announcement in my home town, Tralee, during the week. An advanced manufacturing facility is being put in place there. Until now, we were told continually by IDA Ireland that we did not have suitable properties to attract people to the area. We need to go a step further in this regard, specifically by focusing on private landlords who own lands. In the event that we could incentivise private landlords to restore their buildings to an attractive standard, could we consider off-setting some of the costs against the rates applicable to those buildings for a certain period? In the first instance, this would attract more foreign direct investment and, second, it would afford people the opportunity to commence a business without significant capital expenditure. It would allow turnkey operations, thus increasing the financial viability of the town. It would create jobs, including in reconstruction, and kick-start the entire area. I welcome some very salient provisions in the legislation. Child care operations being provided for the State will not be subject to rates. We need to do more in the private sector in this regard. We talk about the generation that has most felt the downturn, and we have taken steps in this regard through mortgage interest relief, but this generation is having children at present and those children are entering the child care system. Child care needs to be more affordable. While this can be achieved through social protection, the instrument in question is a very simple one as it means child care can be provided if the rates are less and that the overall cost to the individual of procuring the service can come down. I acknowledge that it is only a little piece of the jigsaw for child care. I encourage the Minister to examine the private sector in addition to the public sector. The attractiveness of towns and the tourism aspect are important. Some Deputies said that, during a fine summer, owners of restaurants and public houses want to put chairs and tables outside. There needs to be collaboration between the Valuation Office and local authorities. There needs to be flexibility to prevent people from overstepping the mark and obstructing business people from carrying on as normal. All concerned should work in a tasteful and meaningful manner that promotes business and makes a place look better. Chambers of commerce and chambers of alliance have a role to play in this regard. We are probably reaching a point in our history at which we are integrating all services in a better fashion. I encourage this. A top-down approach would be a better one. There is a fairer and better form of flexibility provided for in this Bill. Shopping centres will now be subject to a rate that recognises that the free car parking they provide to their customers will be linked intrinsically to the valuation of car parking for which the public must pay in adjacent neighbourhoods. This will increase rates and the cost will be pushed onto the businesses. As a business owner, I have no problem with that because it actually means people will be on a more level playing field. It is very good. A lot more needs to be done to promote businesses, but I acknowledge this legislation is a start. With regard to the speed at which we can proceed, some recommendations involving the Valuation Office could take ten or 15 years to address. Overall, small businesses need a break and need to be promoted. Buildings that are redundant need to be put back into the system, forcibly and not just when there is a demand on them. The French model is the one I have been researching most of all. When one walks through an area in France on a Sunday afternoon, one notices that the shopping centres are compelled to close at that time. People go towards the town centres. It is a family day out and there is no obsession with the shopping ethos. There is a vibrancy in the older-generation areas and this results in a boutique feel, a cultural feel and a uniqueness that needs to be examined and promoted. It is not just a question of saying something needs to be done, because we must generate ideas. That is what this place is about. I am just conveying some of my thoughts and welcoming some developments that have taken place heretofore. Overall, this is a great debate because Members have ideas and are conveying them. Perhaps another Private Members’ Bill could come before the House to develop this further.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	458	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this extremely important debate, which goes to the very core of supporting small businesses, particularly those in the retail sector. It deals with a very important component of our economy that has not in recent years received the attention it warrants. This Bill was published in August 2012, yet we are only discussing it in the Dáil two and a half years later. Granted, it has been through the Seanad. Effectively we are talking about a business tax, because that is what commercial rates comprise. We must ask ourselves whether the system is equitable and whether the new Bill we are talking about will bring about more fairness. I do not believe it will.Basically, this Bill tinkers with existing legislation that is based on something back in the 19th century. It is utterly archaic. Before I get into a negative rant, I acknowledge the positives.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	459	One cannot premeditate a rant.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	460	I acknowledge the positive job creation measures on which the Government has embarked, particularly the work of IDA Ireland on foreign direct investment, for which it is to be congratulated. My colleague, the previous speaker, Deputy McGuinness, talks about how each IDA Ireland job costs in the region of €13,000 to bring about. Such investment is welcome and we need those jobs. The main focus of Government has been on that particular sector of the economy in the past number of years and we need to not ignore it, but certainly look at this area with a greater sense of urgency. While it is not relevant to this Bill, when we talk about IDA Ireland job creation I welcome the investment announced yesterday but question who identified what towns.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	461	I identified Tralee.

#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	463	I thank Deputy Troy.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	464	I hope that it is not done on political interference. Certainly, that is not the way we should look at significant investment. It should be done based on regional development and strategic importance. Returning to the Bill, I admire Deputy Spring. He and previous generations of his family did the State much service, but it worried me to hear a Government Deputy state he hopes the civil servants take on board what he listed. I remind the Deputies on the other side of the House that the people of Ireland gave them the honour and distinction of being elected to office in 2011 and they are the ones who dictate legislation. If the Deputy or any of his colleagues in this House feels there are inadequacies, deficiencies, anomalies or whatever, or if this Bill falls short, this is only the Second Stage reading. We must go through the process. I encourage them to put down the necessary amendments. They have the power and the numbers to ensure that any amendments they see fit can be passed and adopted. We should not be talking about bringing in Private Members' Bills at a later stage because, historically, the proof of the pudding has been in the eating. In the past four years, any Private Members' Bills that have come forward, be it at Private Members' time or Friday morning sittings, have not been implemented. Here we have legislation that is not going far-----
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	465	If I may clarify something, it was because the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, was not here at the time.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	466	Then I hope Deputy Spring will follow it up with amendments and that the Government will take them on board because, in fairness, many of his suggestions were valid. This debate is about listening to all sides of the House to see how we can improve this Bill. While I acknowledge what has been done in the area of foreign direct investment by IDA Ireland, that is not being done to support the SMEs in Ireland today. In the past number of years, the SME sector has been put to the pin of its collar and when one looks at the major costs associated with doing business, rates are the third biggest cost after labour and rent. If we look at what this Government has done on labour and rent, it has contributed to that. The Government parties, in advance of the last general election, got significant support from the retail sector. They took out major advertising on Grafton Street and on many of the media associated with business, stating they would abolish upward-only rent reviews. That was a firm commitment. I understand the person who gave them the legal advice to say it was legally possible to do is the same person who is giving legal advice now having secured a seat around the Cabinet table to say it is not possible to do, and that is wrong. It was wrong to make a promise like that in advance of the election. If one looks at the second cost, the cost of labour, the changes that the Government made to increase employers' PRSI has also contributed to the cost of doing business in this country. If we look at the town centres - the Minister of State will forgive me for being parochial in looking at Mullingar, Athlone and Longford - some are doing better than others. In walking up and down any of our towns one sees a trend, unfortunately not exclusive to my constituency as it is the same the length and breadth of this country, of businesses closing and retail units lying vacant. Some areas are better than others. Thankfully, in Mullingar there are not too many vacant units at present, but the businesses there are put to the pin of their collar. Twelve months ago, I held a meeting on revitalising the retail sector in Mullingar. Over 100 businesses came to see what they could do better to revitalise their business because they want to help themselves and one of the main issues they felt was having a negative impact was commercial rates. The Bill will quite simply tinker around the edges. I firmly believe we should be looking at abolishing the current system and start from scratch. The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, is a Minister I respect. He is an able person. Nowhere was that more evident than on Monday night, and I congratulate him for that.

Let us see what we can do to support these people. The town of Longford is on its knees. There is a meeting tonight in Longford about what we can do to support businesses. With the current format, there is no way that we can do anything. If the members on each of the local authorities want to give a rate reduction, it is of no benefit to the majority of independent traders in the town because a 2% or 3% reduction is only small money.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	469	What is Deputy Troy suggesting?
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	470	The suggestion is to abolish it, start afresh and make it based on profitability. At the end of the day, it is a tax on business. Why should a business pay the exact same commercial rates today as it was paying ten years ago when it was doing much better? For example, a shop in Mullingar that was connected to the construction sector and needed a large floor area to display large bulky goods, had in excess of 60 employed in the good times. A number of years ago, it was down to six employees and the rates stayed the same. That is wrong. My suggestion, basically, is to attach it to profitability so businesses can afford to pay. When one looks back at the length of time it has taken to revalue a property, the Valuation Act came in in 2001 and the process did not start until 2005, which was ridiculous. It should never have been allowed happen. Be that as it may, it happened. It has taken nine years to revalue one third of the properties. By that calculation, even with additional staff coming on board, realistically we could be looking at 2030 by the time all properties are revalued. It should not be the case. Why is there not self-assessment? We introduced the local property tax and everybody can self-assess their own property.If one does not do it in accordance with the regulations and guidelines then a penalty could be applied. Does that not make more sense? As my colleague, Deputy Sean Fleming, said, quite often the people who are in business might be better able to assess their commercial business as opposed to older people who do not have the confidence to do it in regard to the local property tax. I am sure every Member across the House has people coming to their clinics every week or month because they are unsure of the value to put on their house or whether they can pay the tax online or in the post office. We help them out. Anyone in business is well able to do that for themselves. The introduction of self-assessment would help to reduce administrative costs. I wish to refer to two other areas as I am conscious my time is running out, one of which relates to GAA clubs. I welcome the amendment made in the Seanad in that regard. A Fianna Fáil local election candidate originally brought the matter to attention and published a Bill on it. To be fair to the Government, it took the measure on board, which I welcome. It is good that the Government acknowledges good ideas come from all sides of the House, and not just from the Cabinet table but from backbenchers and the Opposition benches. I also refer to crèches. I tabled a Private Members’ motion which was discussed last night and the previous night on the affordability of child care. Child care costs are crippling working people at the moment. The State contributes to some of the costs associated with running a crèche. To be fair, I acknowledge that it is not just the Government but previous Governments also. A memo was sent by a crèche in my constituency which set out the rationale for the 11% increase it intended to introduce from 1 February. The reason it increased its charges included commercial rates, water rates, a reduction in the capitation grant, employers' PRSI and staff training. Four out of the five categories of cost were levied by the State. Deputy Spring made a good suggestion. I accept community child care services are exempt but they comprise only one third of the 4,300 child care facilities in the country at the moment. To be fair, every service is providing something the State has failed to do, namely, early childhood care and education. The main contract with every service is with the State, whether it is to provide the free preschool year or the other schemes that are applicable. The Minister of State must go further. He must look in particular at the facilities that provide the free preschool year. At a minimum, the room or facility should be exempt because only then can one consider helping to reduce the costs.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	471	It is free.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	472	Yes, but it is not free to the people who provide the service. They still have to hire staff and light the facility. It is contributing to the overall costs. The Minister of State must ensure that a condition of any further exemption in the area of child care, which are educational facilities in the very same way that schools are, would be that any reduction would be passed on to parents and could not be swallowed up by the service provider. A submission was made to me by Chambers Ireland. We are all aware of the organisation which has been to the fore in representing the views of its members in conjunction with Retail Excellence Ireland. It has a number of concerns on the Bill. Section 2 addresses the definition of “material change of circumstances” as set out in section 3 of the 2001 Act, but it fails to recognise the single greatest change in the circumstances of most businesses, namely, its profitability in the context of contemporary economic conditions. That is the key. If the way the rate is calculated were to be changed, that would not be an issue. No consideration was given to the concerns of the business community on section 49 of the 2001 Act. No regard was taken of the fall in profitability of a business or a drop in the retail value of the property. There must be a change in emphasis from business being valued on its reserve output to being valued on the actual output. One example of that phenomenon is quarries. Despite holding considerable reserves, they have seen a dramatic decrease in their output and, subsequently, their profits due to the collapse of the construction sector. I do not believe the Bill goes far enough. Provincial towns are suffering badly. Rural villages are dead. Post offices and pubs are closing. In many places, the viability of small community schools is under threat. The Bill will not do anything for schools but what it can do if we are serious about supporting small towns and villages is that we can ensure that all the proposed amendments are taken on board. As it stands, the Bill is not fit for purpose and that is the reason Fianna Fáil will vote against its Second Reading.

However, I feel I should respond to a few points that have been made by some of the previous Opposition speakers. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and most of its provisions. The previous speaker, Deputy Troy, prefaced his comments by saying the Government had done good things in terms of unemployment. He then proceeded to get into a rant, which he said he would not do, about the level of unemployment in the country. It is a bit rich for someone who was elected to the Chamber on the back of Fianna Fáil increasing unemployment to almost 16% to lecture the Government which is responsible this year for a decrease in the unemployment rate to below 10%. It is still far too high but more than 100,000 additional people are in employment in the four years since the Government came to office. That is, arguably, the most significant achievement of the Government. The reduction was much faster than most of the economic commentators and economists predicted. In fairness, great credit is due to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton. The latest provisions of the Action Plan for Jobs were announced this week which led to a series of actions by the Government. This week’s focus was very much on the regions. I partly acknowledge and agree with what Deputy Troy said about unemployment levels not decreasing at the same rate in some regions. However, the recent figures for the regions generally are impressive. There was a 19% reduction in the unemployment rate in County Kilkenny in the past four years. The reduction in the unemployment rate in County Carlow was 14%. They are the two component parts of my constituency if I am allowed to be parochial for a moment. Deputy Troy is about the same age as me and none of the Members present was around for the famous election campaign in 1977 bar you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and perhaps Deputy Sean Fleming in another place.

Perhaps he is correct, but he did ask for their abolition none the less. He stressed the fact that too much emphasis was being put on IDA-related employment by the Government and bemoaned the fact that it cost €13,000 to create an IDA-supported job. A job is a job, and whether it is created by a foreign company or domestically, it is welcome. However, the figures tell a different story. The vast majority of jobs created here in this economy in the past four years have not been created by foreign direct investment companies or IDA-supported companies but by Irish companies. I agree with his request that more emphasis be placed on regional development. I think everybody would agree with that particular request. I welcome the introduction of the Bill. I was struck by Deputy Robert Troy's initial comment. He said he could not support it, having posed the question of whether the rates system could be more fair and equitable. One could criticise the Bill for many reasons, but it will make the rates system more fair and more equitable. It may not make it fair enough and equitable enough but it is an improvement on the existing system. I loved studying economics during my time in college. One of the basic tenets of a taxation system is that it be fair and equitable. The main provisions of the Bill are about making it easier to gather information and streamlining the appeals process. That is welcome, and it makes the system more fair and equitable. I welcome particularly the exemption for not-for-profit child care facilities. Like Deputy Robert Troy, I receive many communications from facilities in my constituency wishing to have that provision included. I welcome also the exemption from rates for sports facilities. We have all been extensively lobbied by community sports bodies in our constituencies. That the provision is included makes sense. Charges for rates should never have been levelled on non-commercial activities. My county colleague Deputy John McGuinness, who contributed earlier, said the Bill did not go far enough. He said that those who argued against him would say that taxation rates should be higher. Far from it; those who argue against him agree that a level playing field, if members will pardon the pun, exists between sports clubs that provide bar facilities and the neighbouring family-run pub. He made the ludicrous proposal on the floor of the House earlier that a sports club should be charged a lower rate for its commercial bar than the family-run pub down the road in the same village. I did not think I would ever hear such nonsense in the House. I agreed with the overwhelming majority of what he said with regard to support for small business, but his proposal that a family-run business should be placed at a disadvantage vis-à-vis a sports club by allowing the club to pay a lower rate on its commercial activities beggars belief. Perhaps he will be in a position to clarify that at a later stage. I wish to make one proposal to the Minister of State. It goes back to what Deputy Arthur Spring said and, in fairness, Deputy Robert Troy touched on it as well. I think there is an overwhelming case to be made in provincial Ireland for a provision for a holiday on commercial rates for premises that have reopened after being closed for six or 12 months, where a new business is starting. Obviously, this would have to be closely policed; it would have to be a new business getting on its feet and not a company moving for the sake of getting a rates holiday. Everybody I have heard speak on the legislation so far has mentioned the number of vacant premises. Some towns across the country are worse than others. We are fortunate enough in Kilkenny city. While there are a significant number of vacant premises in some parts of the town, the main thoroughfares are still fairly well occupied, although other parts of the country are devastated. A national initiative - it should not be left to local authorities - providing some type of a break for new businesses starting in premises that have been closed for six or 12 months should be considered. I firmly believe - and always have - that the best way to help the country's economic growth to continue is to reduce taxes on income. I welcome the fact that in a recent announcement on national radio, the Taoiseach reaffirmed his position in that regard, in marked contrast to the Leader of the Opposition, who recently said, on RTE's "This Week", that he did not support a reduction in the universal social charge or in income but rather increased spending. Has Fianna Fáil learned nothing from its 14-year roller-coaster ride which brought the country to a very high point and then brought it to the depths of economic depression in recent years? He believes that taxes on people who are working should remain at their present level while we return to ramping up expenditure. There has to be a balance. There are certain sectors, such as health and education, where cutbacks have been so severe that there is a strong case to be made for increasing expenditure. I firmly believe that the top rate of income tax - in addition to the universal social charge, which means people are paying 50% to 52% of their income in tax - is penal. The Government's priority should be to reduce that significantly if it has sufficient funds. I believe it has to be done in a fair and equitable manner, linked directly to growth levels in the economy. I would encourage the Government to specifically put that into legislation so that if, in the future, Fianna Fáil and its friends end up back in Government, it cannot do the same wrecking act that it managed to do twice in my lifetime and, arguably, three or four times in the history of the State.  I welcome the main provisions of the Bill. I ask that some consideration be given to the proposal for a rates holiday, not only for provincial Ireland but any part of the country where premises have been closed for up to 12 months and where new businesses wish to open. This legislation might be right place for such a provision.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	482	I thank Deputies on all sides for what has been a very constructive debate. A number of common themes have emerged. It is important to say, in the interests of honesty and bluntness, that not all the issues raised today can be resolved by a valuation Bill. This is a valuation Bill; it is not a magic wand. I acknowledged in my opening contribution that we had a really good engagement in the Seanad. I am not afraid to say that some very good ideas came from the Opposition. I engaged extensively with Senator Thomas Byrne and he engaged with my officials. We had discussions with the Irish Hotels Federation, the Society of Chartered Surveyors, the Sinn Féin Party and the Independents, and had a very good debate in the Seanad. As a result of that, the Bill I am bringing before the House is a substantially better Bill than when it was published. Deputies who say it has taken a long time to get to this point are right.However, they must acknowledge it is the first national revaluation programme in 150 years. If one is blaming this Government for taking two years to get to this point with a better Bill than first published, one needs to put it in perspective. As a result of the Bill going through the Seanad we have a better scenario for sports clubs and child care, and I will deal with those for profit in a moment, and a better scenario for addressing the concerns of a number of industry bodies. Unfortunately, I was not in the House for Deputy Spring's contribution but I heard some of it. He and others raised issues which go beyond the Bill, and as a constituency Deputy I certainly see merit in many of the points raised with regard to how to fund local government, where we go, what is the next step and whether we can further modernise the system of rates, but all of these issues cannot be answered in the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012. Its job is to modernise the valuation system and give people an opportunity to have, as quickly as possible in an expeditious manner, a fair valuation system and uniformity throughout society and counties. I noted some comments that the Government only cares for foreign direct investment, and while it is very important and often used as an abstract concept, it employs 150,000 people in the country. The international financial services sector has 35,000 jobs, 10,000 of which are outside of Dublin. Foreign direct investment is important and I know Deputies opposite appreciate this. Two thirds of the new jobs created last year were created by small and medium enterprises. We have more to do for small and medium enterprises, but if one looks at the establishment of the local enterprise offices, which have acted as one-stop shops, JobsPlus, which incentivises through cash the creation of new jobs in communities, and the regional enterprise strategy announced yesterday, one can see a significant pool of supports, but we need to continue to engage on this. The Bill before us today is quite technical and often complex, as valuation law tends to be. Its core objective is, however, simple. It is to accelerate the revaluation process. I have outlined the measures in the Bill which will help to achieve this acceleration, which are outsourcing, occupier-assisted valuation, the use of computer-aided techniques and aggregated data and the streamlining of the appeals process. The Bill does not make fundamental changes to the valuation or rating systems and, as I outlined, it is not intended to do so. Rates are based on the rental values of property and provide an important and stable source of revenue for local authorities and predictable liabilities for ratepayers. The system must be fair and equitable. Changes made in the Bill make more explicit and transparent the criteria to be considered in determining valuations. While this legislative change is important for the understanding and smooth functioning of the system, it is the completion of the national revaluation programme which translates the theory into practice. To look at some of the areas already completed, so there is no sense of scaremongering, in Limerick 65% of ratepayers saw a reduced rates liability, 32% an increased rates liability and 4% were not previously rated. In Waterford, 65% of people saw a reduced rates liability, 32% an increased rates liability and 2% were not previously rated. People do not have anything to fear from this process. It is about revaluing as quickly as possible so there is fairness and stability in the system. As I have outlined, this will be the first full national revaluation programme in more than 150 years and, crucially, it will put rating authorities on a regular five to ten year revaluation cycle. I agree with the Deputies who stated they would rather see it closer to five years than ten years. This must be the aspiration. This ongoing five to ten year revaluation cycle will represent a radical change for the valuation and rating systems. It will mean valuations and rates are much more relevant to modern realities and it will mean the system is seen in a different and, I dare say, fairer light. I do not agree fully with Deputy Fleming's contention that the rates system is not fit for purpose. I have looked at this extensively in recent months as, I am sure, has the Deputy. I heard Deputy Troy, and I accept he wants to replace the rates system with something else, but when one examines what to replace it with one sees it is quite a complex question and it is not as easy as it seems. I am sure we will engage on this on Committee Stage. The system we have in this country, with minor variations, is operational in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Canada, Australia and elsewhere. The key point is that it is based on the occupation of the property and what a hypothetical tenant would be prepared to pay to rent the property. The unfairness is in the slowness of getting to the point of revaluation, and the fact one could end up paying a rate based on a valuation which is out of date because, as Deputy Fleming correctly stated, it takes too long to revalue. Deputy Fleming made reference to other forms of taxation where business performance is specifically taken into account. This is because these modes of taxation are fundamentally different from commercial rates. In listing these taxes, the Deputy omitted reference to stamp duty, which is a transactional tax based on the value of a property and which is calculated without reference to how a business may be performing or what background debt the vendor may carry. Likewise, the valuations for commercial rate purposes are based on observing the market and assessing what the property might command on the open rental market at a particular point in time. In its 2009 report, the Commission on Taxation considered the importance of commercial rates to local authority funding. The report stated: "We believe the current system of raising local authority finance from commercial rates works reasonably well, despite an outdated basis for valuing commercial properties." The last part is what we need to try to fix and have a more efficient, modern and fit for purpose system. The report recommended:The revaluation initiative should be expedited to ensure that a transparent nationwide valuation system, including a cost-effective route of appeal, is in place as soon as possible. Regular revaluations should be carried out thereafter, in order to ensure that the valuation base remains up-to-date. This should be done as provided for in legislation, at intervals of not more than 10 years.The express purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the issues set out in the 2009 report. Deputy Fleming also made reference to the online services available to taxpayers through the Revenue online service, which is a very good example of electronic government in action. Another excellent example of this is the range of online services available to ratepayers through the Valuation Office's website. Anybody who has used the site will be aware of the full range of services available which, in my view, are second to none, particularly the online map. It is important in terms of ease of reference and transparency in the system. A number of Deputies made the case for the greater use of self-assessment, as it works well for other charges and other taxes. This was also discussed in the other House. As I stated in my opening speech, the Bill will introduce a form of self-assessment. It will introduce much more self-assessment than exists, which will be known as occupier-assisted valuation. This is an extra tool which will not only enable the ratepayer to be more involved in the process but will accelerate and assist in helping to speed up the revaluation programme. I do not agree the valuation for rates purposes is a simple exercise, nor that I have been captured and told everything is too complex nor that this is a system that lends itself to self-assessment in the same way as the local property tax. As Deputies are aware, the valuation determines the slice of the rates burden one will pay. If a group of occupiers of property undervalue their properties, those who will pay are the ratepayers who correctly value their property. There is a knock-on effect as the pie remains the same. A move to a system which has these implications must be introduced very carefully. Deputies Fleming and Wallace suggested simply using a percentage of rent. On a theoretical level, the valuation system is very close to this view, as rental values are key to the determination of valuations. What they suggested might work in a simplified world, but rents are not always simple. There are incentives for tenants, including rate-free introductory periods and rent holidays, and these are provided for in section 48, which dictates how values are determined. In addition, not every ratepayer is a tenant and not every valuation can therefore be based on rent. The Valuation Office must use other methods, including receipts, expenditure and the contractors method, which looks at the cost of replacing the building. The element of self-assessment now being introduced will contribute to the completion of revaluation, and in time I expect it to become a larger part of the system which will be very much welcomed by ratepayers and business organisations as a progressive step forward. Deputies Fleming, Stanley and Fitzmaurice spoke about the incentives to revitalise town centres, including incentives based on refunds of rates. They made the point the system is overly complex and that a grant system should be introduced rather than giving a rates reduction. I was interested to hear of Deputy Fleming's experience in County Laois, and I look forward to learning more about it. I, as I am sure do all Members of the House, applaud local authorities who take initiatives in this area and I have sympathy with regard to the complications imposed upon them, but what we are discussing here is valuation legislation and not rates legislation which governs the collection of rates, and there is a difference. There is no doubt they are interconnected and interdependent, but there is a difference. I am bringing a valuations Bill through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible in the interests of ratepayers. Introducing rate-free periods in rural or other areas, as suggested by Deputy Wallace, has implications for local government funding in these areas and this cannot be ignored. Levelling the playing field, whether referring to locations or sectors, is a key output of revaluation. I suggest in a constructive sense that it is the job of local authorities and those elected to them to play their part at local level, and I am encouraged to hear this is happening in Laois. We need to see more initiatives in all our local authorities. Reference was made to the merger of various organisations into Tailte Éireann, and that this is causing a delay in the revaluation programme.The position is that in line with this Government's policy of rationalising the number of State agencies, we are proceeding with merger of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland, and a new organisation, known as Tailte Éireann, will be established by legislation. Significant progress has been made in bringing this merger about, and the Minister for Justice and Equality has recently announced the draft legislation through which the new body will be established. Under the general scheme announced by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, it is not envisaged that the establishment of this new body will have any delaying effect on the national revaluation programme. On the contrary, Part 5 of the general scheme of the Bill provides specifically for the retention of the statutory office of Commissioner of Valuation, which shall be independent in exercising the functions ascribed to him or her under the Valuation Act. Accordingly, the establishment of Tailte Éireann will result in continuity of operations in regard to the national revaluation programme. We also had a discussion during the debate on Second Stage here about a new discretion that is being introduced where there is no material change of circumstances. I argue this is a very positive change to the existing Valuation Act and will allow the commissioner to correct serious anomalies between revaluations. Deputy Fleming has a view that this should be mandatory as the commissioner would not give this discretion the priority it deserves, but I can assure him I do not believe that to be the case. The Valuation Office completed more than 22,000 revisions since 2011 in parallel with its work on the revaluation. The new discretion is welcomed by the commissioner who has always had an overriding concern in ensuring that the valuation list is equitable and uniform, and this new discretion will not be low on that list of priorities. The ability of the valuation and rates system to respond to changing economic circumstances was raised by a number of Deputies on all sides of this House. The acceleration of the revaluation programme has the same ultimate objective. Prior to the initiation of the revaluation programme, the system was very unresponsive and our aim is to get all local authority areas valued for the first time and, crucially, to get them on to the regular five to ten-year cycle provided for in the Valuation Act 2001. This will represent a sea change for the valuation system and, ultimately, those revaluations - I would share the Deputies views' on this - should be closer to five years rather than ten years. Many Deputies welcomed the positives in this legislation, including the new exemptions for sports clubs and not-for-profit child care providers, and I acknowledge those contributions. I would also like to outline how the Government arrived at a position in regard to not-for-profit child care providers versus other child care providers. I share Deputy Troy's view that the issue of child care is a major one that needs to be addressed. I acknowledge the work done by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and the new intergovernmental committee that will examine this area and report to him before the summer, as I recall. Valuation legislation can only go so far. For every single ratepayer, be it a body or business, we exempt, somebody else has to pay. The pie stays the same. The criterion I have applied is that if one is established for the purpose of making a profit, it is not my job to determine which business profit, business motivation or line of business is more societally worthy than another. It is not my job to decide that the butcher who has set up to make a profit should pay extra rates for the child care provider who has set up for a profit. If one has set up to make a profit, one is rateable. That is the current position. I do not envisage that changing, certainly not in this legislation. The provision in respect of not-for-profit child care providers will exempt about 1,000 not-for-profit child care providers throughout the country and will also bring consistency, as there had been an inconsistency in terms of how that had been applied. I am keen, as I am sure are many Deputies on all sides of the House, that this legislation is enacted without much further delay. I very much look forward to robust debates on Committee and Report Stages, but it is important, as Members have acknowledged, that we ultimately get this legislation passed. Once the legislation is enacted, the Valuation Office is ready to set the wheels in motion on the pilot outsourcing and the occupier-assisted valuations. I can inform the House that the necessary regulations on occupier-assisted valuations are already at an advanced stage of drafting. I want to refer to one other issue that came up during the debate, that of subsequent occupiers' rates liability. While it is a rates issue, it is important to point out, and there did not seem to be a recognition of this from a number of speakers, that this was already addressed last year by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. That legislation was enacted in January 2014 and it introduced a range of reforms to the local government system. It included some important measures to address some of the main issues affecting payment of commercial rates by businesses, including, and this is important, the repeal of subsequent occupier liability. Schedule 2 and Part 6 of the Act repeal subsequent occupier liability within rating law by amending section 71 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1838, no less, and deleting section 19 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1849, the effect of which was to remove the liability that was placed on new occupiers of properties for up to two years of outstanding rates of the previous occupier. This repeal took effect from 24 March 2014. Therefore, people can now occupy premises that have been vacant and benefit from that provision which took effect from 24 March last year. I thank Members on all sides of the House for the input. I believe this Bill modernises the valuation system. It is not a magic wand; it is just one part of the toolkit that we need to put in place to make sure that we have a modern and fit-for-purpose system for how the State interacts with the business community. I look forward to Committee Stage and to considering any amendments Members may wish to put forward on that Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.

We have been talking about this for approximately 25 years and finally we have an opportunity to address this important issue and to put in place some specific targets to tackle climate change, which is scientifically certain and irrevocable. Whereas I welcome the concept and publication of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill, it is seriously defective as it stands. There are no clear targets for carbon emissions or clear definitions in the Bill. How does the Minister, for example, expect the national expert advisory council to develop and publish annual reports when it does not have clear indications of what we are striving towards each year? As a number of Deputies mentioned last night, there is no real provision for the concept of climate justice and addressing the impact of the developed world's effect on the poorer countries of the planet because of carbon emissions. There is a number of lacunae in the Bill which the Minister should address on Committee and Report Stages, as he clearly feels he is beginning consultation with respect to the main sectors of the economy. The exercise could equally be seen as an effort at kicking the can down the road for another two years and for subsequent Dáileanna. The Minister yesterday indicated that the Bill will pursue a "low carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050". That sounds great and we have 35 years to get to that aspirational state, but how will it be done? This Bill does not have a roadmap to achieve it, so we need clearly defined carbon emission targets in order to realise an environmentally sustainable economy and the targets we have already committed to achieving at EU and international levels. The Minister has made much of those European and international targets but Ireland has a special role to play, given the levels of carbon emissions per capita are the second-highest in the developed world after the United States. It seems that in some ways the Government is merely paying lip-service to our EU and international commitments and is more concerned about being perceived to be acting on climate change rather than placing an emphasis on the importance of properly addressing this problem for our island, our future generations, our economy and our planet. The Government has been in power for four years with no climate change action plan in place and now we are on course to exceed our EU 2020 target of reducing emissions by 20% compared with 2005 emissions. Section 4 of the Bill, addressing the national low carbon transition and mitigation plan, looks impressive in its intention to have the first plan in place not later than 24 months after the passing of the Act. Section 5, relating to the national climate change adaptation framework, is also planned to be place within 24 months, with sectoral adaptation plans having Ministers reporting under section 6. The outline is impressive on paper but it seems the heavy lifting is being left to the next and subsequent Dáileanna. I listened to the Minister's speech carefully yesterday, when he repeatedly referred to "cost-effective" measures and the "need to achieve the objectives of a national mitigation plan at the least cost to the national economy", as well as the importance of not imposing "an unreasonable burden on the Exchequer". The Minister might also agree that fines we are potentially facing for missing our promised targets could also be seen as an unreasonable burden on the future economy. For example, approximately €90 million is the estimated cost of purchasing compliance with the non-emission trading system targets and another fine for missing our 2020 renewable energy sources target could cost the Government between €140 million and €160 million. We have already spent at least €17 million buying carbon credits. There are costs from every side. I hope this and the next Government in evaluating costs will consider the potential for cost-effective mitigation measures in investment for public transport, for example, or more sustainable agriculture. Transport, agriculture and energy represent over 70% of our carbon emissions. We have known for a generation at least the theory behind why we need climate change legislation. We have been talking about this problem for decades but are starting to feel the real effects of global warming. Research papers produced by the Irish climate analysis and research unit at the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, and Met Eireann's study on the future of Ireland's climate and the effects of climate change on our island highlight the significant challenges facing us. We have the prospect of warmer and drier summers on the island, with increases of 3° Celsius to 4° Celsius towards the end of the century; in one way, that sounds very nice, as we enjoyed last summer's wonderful weather without very much rain. Nevertheless, the Government needs to lead by example. We need to highlight the negative impacts of climate change and the negative effects of drier summers for our agriculture, for example, there may be increased droughts, increasing pressure on grasslands and increasing demand for water. As citizens, we are already extremely worried about the disorganised farce that is the Government's handling of water supplies and the failure of successive Governments to invest in local and regional water supplies. Our winters will be wetter as world temperatures increase and weather systems become more erratic and volatile. In my own constituency of Dublin Bay North, this has already been an ongoing issue that Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council cannot seem to mitigate at current precipitation levels. We have had serious flooding problems. Part of Dublin Bay North is a polder and any significant increase in world sea levels could place greater stress on river and sea management systems and defences in our constituency. Sea levels are currently rising on average about 3.5 cm per decade around the country, and across the world we are more likely to experience intense cyclones and changes in the temperature in our sea will affect our marine ecosystems. I accept that the Bill, while purely aspirational as it stands, is at least a starting point. The Minister deserves some credit in this respect. It has impressive intentions to "pursue, and achieve, the transition to a low carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable economy by the end of the year 2050". I welcome the proposal for the establishment of the national expert advisory council on climate change but I cannot understand why the Minister would reject the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in its report on the heads of the Bill, when it called for all the members of the advisory council to be independent. The chairperson, Deputy McCarthy, did some very good work in that respect. The Minister should reconsider the issue, as the comparison has been made with the fiscal council. We are getting used to its work in how we manage budgets. I also welcome the planned five-year national low carbon transition and mitigation plans under section 4 but it will probably be 2023 before we see the first report. There are three major amendments needed to improve this bill and make it a useful piece of legislation rather than just a start to the discussion. Those amendments were highlighted yesterday by many Deputies, including Deputy Murphy, so I will not go over their importance again. I ask the Minister to consider them seriously when they come before us on Committee and Report Stages.The Minister should include a definition of low carbon emissions, which was defined by the Minister's predecessor, ensure the independence of the advisory council and highlight under climate justice our responsibility to poorer countries whose geographical positions leave them at the mercy of dangerous weather systems producing typhoons and repeated serious flooding. Agriculture, energy and transport account for just over 70% of our domestic sector emissions, and these sectors will present the biggest challenges to reducing our carbon emissions. The joint committee heard from all relevant sectors, and its recommendations to the Minister were in no way radical but were seen to be collaborative, realistic and achievable. The Minister only adopted three of the recommendations in the report, however, none of which relates to managing the 31.9% of overall emissions from the agriculture sector. The recommendation to support rain-fed, grass-based agriculture instead of a more intensive, less sustainable form of agriculture was ignored. Indeed, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, appears to be following a traditional and less sustainable agricultural output agenda. I mentioned earlier our responsibilities to the developing countries which have been suffering from the effects of climate change, to the causes of which they contributed little or nothing. Ireland is currently second only to the USA in carbon emissions per capita, with 12.58 tonnes per person per annum in the Republic. We are emitting carbon at levels way above the per capita levels of the UK and our other European partners. Ireland's contribution to carbon emissions worldwide totals more than that of the poorest 400 million human beings on the planet. The Philippines is a group of 7,000 islands, as we heard two days ago in the course of a good report given by an expert from the Philippines at a meeting organised by Deputy Catherine Murphy. It is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to the increasing incidence and growing intensity of typhoons. The worst so far struck in 2013 and left 10,000 people dead and 2 million without homes. If we do not act on climate change now, there may be worse to come. Due to migration over the past decade, with thousands of Filipino nurses and care workers coming to live and work in Ireland, many Irish people are now much more familiar with the grave concerns of the Filipino nation about climate change. We in the developed world are contributing to the onset of the erratic weather which countries such as the Philippines must endure due to our unsustainable carbon economy. In retrospect, we have been paying lip service to climate change for too long. For much of the 1990s, I was a member of the rainbow alliance which ran Dublin City Council and which included the Green Party. I was very active in supporting climate change mitigation initiatives, especially in the promotion of cycling. Indeed, when I led the Labour Party in the city council, we initiated the first citywide cycling network. We also strongly supported public transport initiatives, such as the Luas and metro north, and renewable energy for the city. Sadly, however, when the six Green Party Deputies propped up Bertie Ahern's Government after 2007 and each one of them was appointed a Minister, very little was achieved on climate change. Even any version of the Bill before us failed to appear. One of the better initiatives introduced by the former Minister, former Deputy John Gormley, however, was the carbon budget, which included some clearly defined objectives and targets. In his speech announcing the first carbon budget, which I believe was in 2008, Mr. Gormley said that it was putting "the challenge of tackling climate change at the heart of Government policy", but beyond the aspirational carbon budget and a few small mitigation measures relating to motor tax and so forth, the Green Party in government failed to achieve any serious progress. No important legislation was introduced. Another environmental matter that the Green Party constantly spoke about was the problem of noise, but four years of that Government elapsed and another four years under this Government have passed and we still do not have a noise Bill. No significant measures were taken to reduce our carbon emissions. Eight years later, we are set to exceed our EU 2020 targets to reduce emissions by 20% in 2020 relative to 2005 levels in our non-emissions trading scheme sectors. The failure of Mr. Gormley and the Green Party's intentions and insight can be directly related to the fact that no legislation was enacted. In the case of the aspirational Bill before us, there will be little gain unless the Government ensures that specific, defined targets are outlined. While the Bill is welcome, it requires serious amendment. I hope the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, will give thought to that on Committee Stage and will accept some of the amendments and, indeed, follow the recommendations of the environment committee. The Acting Chairman, Deputy Wall, might recall that the Programme for Government 2011-2016 had a red cover, but at the Labour Party conference one of my colleagues, Councillor O'Callaghan, said that it should have been a blue cover. In the programme there was a commitment to "publish a Climate Change Bill which will provide certainty
surrounding government policy and provide a clear pathway
for emissions reductions", yet this Bill does not provide any certainty to me or to the people I met who visited this House to give an excellent briefing. They were from the 28 organisations that combined to form Stop Climate Chaos and were in Buswells Hotel last Tuesday. The Bill does not answer our concerns and it does not provide a clear pathway to the sectors that need to start making changes to how they plan and operate. Science has told us that there is a carbon budget of 245 billion tonnes of carbon left on the planet before we start to enter even more dangerous global warming territory. We are currently burning 11 billion tonnes per year, so we have two decades left, at best, before we start heading towards a four degree increase in warming. As was said by one of the speakers at Deputy Catherine Murphy's very informative briefing earlier this week: "We are the last generation that can effectively fight climate change." I urge the Minister to step up to the plate. We welcome the publication of the Bill at last; it would be churlish not to. I ask the Minister to heed the recommendations of the committee, on foot of all the hard work that was done by our colleagues under the chairmanship of Deputy McCarthy, and to accept the three key amendments relating to climate justice, having a clear definition of the emissions and having clear targets. They are areas on which we should take action. The Minister might well say, as others have said over the years, that because our economy is so small in overall terms relative to the big European economies and a continental economy such as that of the United States, our efforts are marginal. Many Deputies have made that point. However, an economy that will be performing well, one hopes, and which is also aiming to be a sustainable economy, especially in agriculture, transport and energy, is the type of economy we want our country to have. I ask the Minister to examine the theme that has run through so many speeches yesterday and today and to address those matters.

I also wish to make it more robust. It is a little limp at present due to the lack of definitions, targets and in respect of climate justice. It ought to be strengthened and made more robust in those three areas. We should not be afraid. Otherwise, the Minister is introducing a limp Bill that does nothing.

Although I am a member of the environment committee, I was not a member of it when it compiled its report. I give credit to Deputy Michael McCarthy and the members who worked so diligently on it.This is the most urgent and important issue facing not just this country but the world. As the previous speaker stated, we face huge climate risks in the world between rising temperature, the danger of flooding, and ocean and atmosphere issues. Worst of all is the danger of not being able to halt the onset of climate change. This is the most important debate we will have in this Chamber during this Dáil. At the same time, the issue is very difficult because it presents us with huge challenges. It is very hard for us to change our ways and we resent having to change them. However, if we do not, our situation will become unlivable for many people. It will often be the most vulnerable people who will be in that situation. I wish to address some matters in the Bill. I welcome the idea of having a national mitigation plan, but I ask the Minister, if possible, to shorten the timespan for the introduction of the plan.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	490	Tá mé fíor-bhuíoch don Cheann Comhairle as ucht an seans labhairt faoin ábhar tábhachtach agus dáiríre seo. Tá mé buíoch don Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála as ucht bheith i láthair. Today, as we should know, is the 26th anniversary of the killing of human rights lawyer Pat Finucane. I knew Pat very well. He was my lawyer. I am sure the Minister, as a lawyer himself, understands this and that he was an excellent advocate for the rights of citizens who refused to be intimidated by threats from loyalists and the RUC. Pat believed in the law. He believed he could use the law to bring about people's rights, create a way forward and defend people. I wish to commend Pat's wife, Geraldine, and their family for their unwavering courage and diligence in pursuing their demand for a public inquiry all these years. In 2001, there was a breakthrough when the British and Irish Governments agreed at Weston Park to invite Judge Peter Cory to examine four cases. Judge Cory concluded that four inquiries should be held. Three have taken place, including one by the Irish Government. However, the British Government has refused to honour its commitment. In October 2011, the British Prime Minister further disappointed the Finucane family by dismissing the having of an inquiry and instead appointing Desmond de Silva to review the case files. The de Silva report was published in December 2012 and it revealed a shocking scale of collusion by the British and Unionist paramilitaries. It serves to reinforce the need for an inquiry into the killing of Pat Finucane. The de Silva report revealed that 85% of intelligence the UDA used to target people for murder originated from British army and RUC sources. Agents working for MI5, RUC Special Branch and British Military Intelligence were participating in criminality, including murder. This issue was also considered extensively at British cabinet level. There was administrative and ministerial authority for these policies. It has been revealed that the director general of MI5 briefed Margaret Thatcher in 1988. This is all fact. The murder of Pat Finucane by state agents was not a one-off incident. It was the norm. Collusion was a matter of institutional and administrative practice by successive British Governments and Lethal Allies by Anne Cadwallader should be necessary reading for every Teachta Dála in this House. She looks at the activities of one particular gang, the Glenanne gang. This practice involved the establishment of unionist paramilitary groups, the systematic infiltration by the British of all unionist death squads at the highest levels, the controlling and direction of these groups, their training, and they also provided them with information on people to be killed. This is based on a strategy developed by a man called Frank Kitson. He coined the phrase "counter-gangs". This is the set up of counter-gangs which was done in the North and other colonial places. They also helped to import weapons from the old South African apartheid regime, which killed hundreds of people. I do not have time to bring the House through the facts and detail of all of that. The role of successive Irish Governments, not just this one, has not been as strategic or consistent as it could be. I spoke with Theresa Villiers, the British Secretary of State, by telephone today. Among other things, I raised this issue with her. I have raised it in this House and elsewhere countless times. The Taoiseach tells me, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, in fact I believe him, that he has raised this issue with the British Prime Minister. However, I am not satisfied he has done it with the conviction required. It is clear that Mr. Cameron will not willingly agree to a public inquiry. He ruled this out when I raised it with him in the company of the Taoiseach during the Stormont House talks. Incidentally, the Taoiseach remained silent during that conversation. It is therefore little wonder that the British Government behaves as it does. I request the Government to go beyond the polite requests which are brushed aside. We need to develop a strategy to employ the full resources of our diplomatic service to raise this case with our international friends at every opportunity and to bring the case before the UN. I applaud the fact that the case of the guinea pigs, the hooded-men, is being taken to the European Court. We should raise this issue within the European Union and with our friends in the Government of the United States. Every available international forum should know the Irish Government wants this case dealt with.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	491	On this day, the 26th anniversary of the murder of Pat Finucane, I wish to express sympathy, on my own behalf and on behalf of members of the Government, to Mrs. Geraldine Finucane and all the Finucane family. That any family should witness the cold-blooded murder of a loved one is appalling. That their quest for the full and transparent truth about the horrendous events of that day is still ongoing only compounds their sense of loss and grief. This is why successive Irish Governments have consistently supported the call on behalf of the Finucane family for a full, independent and public judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane, in line with the commitments made by the Irish and British Governments at Weston Park in 2001. As Deputies will be aware, this position has the cross-party support of this House following an all-party motion of 2006 which called for the immediate establishment of such an inquiry. In October 2011, the British Government announced that Desmond de Silva QC would conduct a legal review into the circumstances surrounding the murder of Pat Finucane. The review was proposed as an alternative to the public inquiry which had been recommended by the Canadian judge, Judge Cory, in his independent report produced in accordance with the commitments of the Weston Park agreement. The report of the de Silva review was published in December 2012. It found that there was state collusion in the case and that "a series of positive actions by employees of the State actively furthered and facilitated [Pat Finucane's] murder, and that, in the aftermath of the murder, there was a relentless attempt to defeat the ends of justice". In his statement to the House of Commons on 12 December 2012, Prime Minister Cameron accepted the report's findings of shocking levels of state collusion and repeated his apology to the Finucane family. He disagreed, however, that a public inquiry would produce a fuller picture of what happened and what went wrong. Following the publication of the report, the Government reiterated our position on the need for an independent public inquiry into the murder in accordance with the Weston Park agreement and the recommendation of Judge Cory.We continue to do so. As recently as yesterday, I raised the issue during my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers. She repeated, as I am sure she did to Deputy Adams this afternoon, the current British Government's position that the clear findings of the de Silva review report and Prime Minister Cameron's public apology in the House of Commons constitute her Government's response to the case and that it does not intend to provide for a full public inquiry. I note that following the publication of the de Silva review report, the opposition Labour Party in Britain indicated that it believes a public inquiry is necessary for Pat Finucane's family and for Northern Ireland. I understand that judicial review proceedings are being taken by Mrs. Finucane in the High Court in Northern Ireland regarding the decision not to hold a public inquiry. I reiterate to Deputy Adams and indeed to the House that today is a particularly sad day for the Finucane family. I reiterate my condolences to them on their great loss. The Irish Government will continue to support them in their quest for a full public truth regarding the dreadful events of 26 years ago.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	492	I am disappointed with the Minister's answer. Have we raised this at the UN? Have we raised this at the EU? Have we asked our ambassadors to lobby on this internationally? Have we raised this with the Obama Administration in the White House? This is what Governments are supposed to do. They are supposed to use diplomatic services to uphold the rights of citizens. The Minister should read Frank Kitson's book on the counter-insurgency strategy in the North. I commend it to him. That strategy was honed over decades of colonial actions around the world. At its core, Frank Kitson articulated that "the Law should be used as just another weapon [to get rid of] unwanted members of the public". Pat Finucane was an officer of the court and a human rights lawyer. He was got rid of not by murder gangs, but at the direction under the administrative practice that the British Government has cleared. Report after report has lifted the lid on many actions. We know that the peace process did not happen by an act of divine mercy. It did not happen by accident. It happened because people took risks, chances and appropriate steps. We are not asking the Government to take huge risks. A British Government will be assisted. I remind the House that they have just had to open the books on their torture of Mau Mau detainees 40 years ago. They were recently forced to open the books on the people they tortured in Palace Barracks outside Belfast. This is good for the process of building the future. I will repeat what I have said many times. The British and Irish Governments are co-equal guarantors of all that has flowed from the Good Friday Agreement onwards. We are not junior partners. We are co-equal guarantors. I will repeat the call I have made. I know I sometimes speak very directly. I do not mean to be harsh. It is the way I talk. We should launch a diplomatic initiative in the US, at the heart of the EU and in the UN on this and other cases. We need to develop a strategy and a campaign to bring this about. We should use our status as having one of the most successful peace processes in modern times. These issues continue to infect and draw down, rather than giving people closure. I respectfully commend this approach to the Minister.

We continue to make it absolutely clear in all circumstances that the position of the Irish Government remains one of full support for a public inquiry in line with the commitments agreed upon at Weston Park. That has been the position for many years and continues to be the position. There is absolutely no movement in that regard. We made it quite clear as recently as yesterday that our position differs fundamentally from that of the British Government. Can I say to Deputy Adams that this Government will continue to support the Finucane family in whatever way possible in their quest to establish a full and transparent truth on this issue?

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	496	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for granting me permission to raise this issue, which I have been seeking to raise for some time. As Members of the House may know, in August 2013, when Ibrahim Halawa was a 17 year old young man on holidays in Egypt with his sisters, he got caught up in the turmoil and difficulties that were then taking place in that country. Ibrahim Halawa and his sisters engaged in peaceful protest at that time and were ultimately arrested and detained. His sisters have long since been released and are no longer at risk in the context of the circumstances in which they originally found themselves. Ibrahim Halawa, who is now 19 years of age, has been held in prison in Egypt for 18 months. I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs is fully aware of Ibrahim Halawa's circumstances and has been in contact with the Egyptian authorities about him. The trial of Ibrahim Halawa has been postponed on four separate occasions. The Irish ambassador and the Irish consular officials have been in regular contact with him. Family visits are allowed. Last year, shortly before I ceased to be Minister for Justice and Equality and following consultation with the then Tánaiste, I attempted to make contact with my counterpart in Egypt, the Egyptian Minister for Justice, on a number of occasions with a view to discussing Ibrahim Halawa's circumstances. Unfortunately, that did not prove possible and contact was not successfully made. It is normally the approach of this State to stand back and allow the law to take its course in other states with which we have good relations. We try to allow matters to be dealt with before the courts in such countries. We have good relations with Egypt, of course. Egypt is a friend of Ireland and Ireland is a friend of Egypt. I believe matters have reached a stage where a new initiative is required. The most recent date on which the trial of Ibrahim Halawa was supposed to take place was last week. We know that the trial with which he is confronted is very different from trials in this country. It will be a mass trial with myriad charges brought against Ibrahim Halawa and approximately 490 other individuals. No court system anywhere in the world could ensure the charges brought before it in such circumstances are dealt with in a manner that makes sure each individual before the court gets justice and protects his or her individual human rights. Ibrahim Halawa is now an Amnesty prisoner of conscience. There are concerns that he has been mistreated during his time in prison. He shared a cell with Peter Greste, the Australian al-Jazeera journalist who was released recently in response to representations made by the Australian Government and on whose behalf the al-Jazeera news network campaigned. I believe this young man, who has now been in jail for 18 months, should be released. Given that the Egyptian authorities have seen fit to release his sisters, who had been held on foot of their involvement in a demonstration, he should not be treated differently.If it was appropriate to release them, and it was, then it is appropriate to release him. I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to take a new initiative - that is, to request formally of the Egyptian Government and the Egyptian President that Ibrahim be released. New laws introduced in Egypt have facilitated such an approach. It was on the basis of such an approach by the Australian Government that Peter Greste was released. Ibrahim Halawa is a citizen of this State. He is a constituent of mine. His father is a leader of the Muslim community in this city and county of Dublin. I think we should now say to the Egyptian Government that it has friendly relations with Ireland and we have diplomatic relations, so please release this young man and let him return to his life and resume his education in Ireland.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	498	I thank Deputy Shatter for raising this important issue and for giving me an opportunity to update the House. Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen, and his three sisters were detained following incidents at the Al Fateh mosque in Ramses Square in Cairo on 17 August 2013. His sisters were later released, but Ibrahim remains in detention. His case is a matter of concern for me, as I know it is for many people. From my first day in office, I have taken an active role in progressing matters. During my first week, I spoke to the Egyptian foreign Minister, Mr. Sameh Shoukry, and set out my concerns regarding Ibrahim's detention. I have spoken with Mr. Shoukry on a number of other occasions, including twice in person in New York and Cairo. I stressed each time that Ibrahim Halawa was only 17 years of age at the time the alleged offences were committed and asked for his release so that he might return to his studies and his family. Officials in Dublin and Cairo have been in ongoing and sustained contact with the Egyptian authorities, including senior officials from the foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Justice and the Office of the Prosecutor-General. Ibrahim Halawa has received 34 consular visits from Irish Embassy staff, including our ambassador, Ms Isolde Moylan, with approximately one visit every fortnight, most recently on 7 February. It is the view of the Government that Ibrahim Halawa should not be tried as part of a group trial involving a large number of defendants and on the basis of group charges, but solely on the basis of specific evidence. Our concerns about this case include the Egyptian authorities' continued consideration of Ibrahim's case as part of a group trial and the fact that he was only 17 years of age when the alleged offences took place. Recently, I availed of the opportunity to raise this case directly with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Federica Mogherini. She undertook to raise the case with the relevant and appropriate authorities, and stressed that we could count on all the assistance that the EU institutions can provide. I am concerned that, as Deputy Shatter stated, the trial was delayed for the fourth time on 8 February and is now scheduled to take place on 29 March. I have maintained ongoing contact with the Halawa family since August 2013. I met members of the Halawa family earlier today, at which time I discussed the postponement of the hearing and possible next steps. We will continue to work closely with them as we work actively on the case. The Egyptian President has issued a decree in respect of foreign nationals in Egypt who have been sentenced or are awaiting trial. I am aware of the recent deportation from Egypt of the Australian al-Jazeera journalist, Mr. Peter Greste. However, there are few, if any, details available as to the exact scope and practical operation of the presidential decree. In particular, it remains unclear exactly what the decree may mean in practice for those whom Egypt regards as dual or Egyptian nationals, as is the case for Ibrahim. Officials in my Department remain in ongoing contact with Ibrahim's lawyer regarding this issue and continue to highlight his Irish citizenship and seek further information from the Egyptian authorities about the practical operation of the new decree. I am also aware that the other al-Jazeera journalists have been granted bail today pending their retrial later in the month. My officials are closely monitoring all developments and will remain in sustained contact with the authorities in Cairo. This is a difficult case in a complex and challenging context. While Ireland cannot interfere with the judicial process in Egypt, our concern at the continued and lengthy period of detention has been raised with the Egyptian authorities in a clear and sustained manner, as has the critical importance of due process in this case. Ireland will continue to seek a review of the case. We will continue to seek Ibrahim's release and his return to his studies and his family. In the meantime, we will offer all possible consular assistance to Ibrahim and his family.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	499	I would like to thank the Minister for his very detailed response. I know that, during my time in government, initially the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was very anxious that matters be dealt with by its officials in Egypt, by the ambassador and, indeed, through that Department. The approach - which is the usual approach - was to provide all the consular assistance and advice possible on the assumption that matters would come before the courts within a reasonable period of time and there would be adequate human rights protections. I want to say to the Minister that I particularly welcome his comment that he is actively seeking the release of Ibrahim. My understanding of the new legal provisions that are now in place in Egypt is that it is indeed possible that the President could decide to facilitate his release. He was in prison, sharing a cell, effectively, with Peter Greste, the journalist who has now been released and returned to Australia. This is a young man to whom great damage may be done by his continued incarceration. Not only will he experience the trauma of finding himself in these circumstances and the impact on his education, but he will need time to recover from the experiences that he has been through. It is of huge importance that we emphasise the urgency of this. The one issue that I have concerns about - I know the Minister understands this and has mentioned it - is the concept of due process. There can be no due process in any trial in which an individual is prosecuted on a myriad of charges which are levelled against more than 490 other individuals and in which those against whom charges are brought are brought to prison and held in an enormous cage where it is difficult even to hear what is happening in the court, with no realistic capacity for lawyers to represent them individually. This is a human rights issue. This is an Irish citizen. We are entitled to say to the Egyptian Government that this is not an appropriate way to proceed in its courts in dealing with an Irish citizen and that, in the interests of good relations between Ireland and Egypt, it should release this young man and allow him return home.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	500	The Deputy will be aware that it is not within our power or authority to interfere unduly in a criminal matter in a foreign jurisdiction. That notwithstanding, I have outlined the steps that the Irish Government has taken and will continue to take in order to secure a positive outcome. This difficult and challenging case has consumed the attention of many of our officials for many months. I have twice met the Egyptian foreign Minister and had telephone contact a number of other times. I ask people to accept that Ireland is unable to interfere in the judicial process of another country, but we will continue raising our concerns. This morning, I had a positive and constructive meeting with members of the family, during which I outlined the steps that we had taken to progress the matter. I can confirm to the House that those talks were held in a practical and open spirit in furtherance of our shared objective of seeking a positive outcome to the case. I will continue using every avenue available, including the recent presidential decree. In that regard, we are engaging in the legal and technical process in order to allow for the decree to operate in a way that will help in this case. I again thank the Deputy for raising this issue. He has raised it with me over a number of months in correspondence. I will continue to keep both him and the House updated on all appropriate occasions as necessary.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	501	I wish to raise the role and powers of the National Transport Authority to deal with applications from companies that want to reduce their bus services through various areas throughout the country. I am raising this matter because of a recent letter I received from the chief executive of the National Transport Authority concerning services by Bus Éireann and Kavanagh's Buses through several midland counties. One sentence in the letter is most disturbing. It states: "Where operators apply to withdraw or curtail services the authority will grant such amendments as it has no legislative powers to refuse them." What is the purpose of having a regulator or authority if it has no powers to deal with issues that affect paying customers? The letter also stated that Bus Éireann provides commercial route 7 between Cork and Dublin via Clonmel and Kilkenny. The service is licensed by the National Transport Authority. The authority recently granted an amendment to this licence which incorporated essentially going on the motorway in a more direct manner to Dublin Airport and the withdrawal of all services south of Clonmel. There has also been a withdrawal of all services provided to a number of intermediate locations, including Kilsheelan, Carrick-on-Suir, Paulstown, Muine Bheag, Royal Oak cross, Leighlinbridge, Carlow Institute of Technology, Carlow town, Castlecomer, Crettyard, Newtown, Ballylinan, which are in County Laois, Athy, Kilcullen and Naas. According to the National Transport Authority, J.J. Kavanagh provides commercial route 717 on the same route. The service is also licensed by the authority. The authority has recently made an offer of an amendment to the withdrawal of this licence, which incorporates the introduction of faster routes along the motorway and a withdrawal of services being provided to Castlecomer, Ballylinan, KiIcullen and Naas. It is an outright disgrace that all the authority does is rubber-stamp an application. Why bother having a transport authority if bus operators can do what they like in these situations? No public consultation is allowed by law. It is a hidden process and customers only know about changes when a notice is posted on the local bus stating that it will not be there next week. These operators provide a service to carry people to work in all those towns, as well as to attend hospital and medical appointments and for shopping. The bus services also take pupils to school and students to Carlow IT. My colleague, Deputy John McGuinness, has attended many meetings on this issue in the Kilkenny and Castlecomer area, while Deputy Ó Fearghaíl, has attended similar meetings in Kildare. This is a major issue and it is not the first time these bus operators have acted thus. Kavanagh's has already been allowed by the National Transport Authority to abandon people in Castledermot, Crookstown and Ballitore in County Kildare, all in order to get to the airport quicker from some other location. In addition, the National Transport Authority approved the entire abandonment by Bus Éireann of Abbeyleix, Durrow and Cullahill on the Dublin-Cork route last year, and more recently the abandonment of Mountrath, Castletown and Boris-in-Ossory in County Laois on the Dublin-Limerick route, all in order to go on the motorway. I wrote to the chief executive of Bus Éireann and have also spoken to him about this matter. I have also contacted the National Roads Authority. There are six routes in each direction by Bus Éireann daily, while Kavanagh's has five buses in each direction in those areas. I have suggested that if some people want to travel more quickly by motorway, three or four buses could do so. However, the operators should not abandon the 12 buses that are passing through those towns and villages daily. They could have agreed to leave a proportion of them. It should be remembered that they receive a public service obligation contribution from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I will raise that matter in my supplementary question. They should not continue to get that PSO payment for a reduction in services.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	502	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am very much aware of the importance of this matter and of the concern felt by many about the withdrawal, or threat of withdrawal, of bus services from their towns and villages. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and I met last evening with residents from some of the towns affected by these changes. At a national level, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger land transport services. This includes the provision of subvented bus and rail services by Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and Irish Rail. The NTA also licenses commercial bus passenger services. Under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, the NTA assumed responsibility for the regulation of commercial bus passenger services. The Act obliges all operators to be licensed if they are providing public bus passenger services, and it is applied equally to both private and State companies. Public service obligation services covered by public service contracts do not fall within the licensing system. Commercial bus services are licensed in accordance with the provisions of the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 and in line with the NTA's published guidelines for the licensing of public bus passenger services. The guidelines are published on the NTA's website. The guidelines were prepared in accordance with the detailed provisions set out in section 23 of the 2009 Act. Where operators apply to withdraw or curtail commercial bus services, the NTA will grant such amendments as it has no legislative powers to refuse them. In such circumstances, the NTA may examine whether, in the absence of any commercial services, a public service obligation exists to provide socially necessary, but commercially unviable, public transport services. Such examination will include an assessment of the demand for public transport services and options either to reconfigure existing PSO services or to tender competitively for the provision of services. In either event, the NTA's ability to provide such services is subject to the availability of funding. I need not remind the Deputy of the huge pressure on public finances that our Government inherited. Despite this, with our economy now recovering, I was able to secure an additional €101 million in funding for our public transport companies in a Supplementary Estimate at the end of last year. I was also able to maintain the level of PSO funding in 2015, as was provided in 2014. This is the first time there has not been a cut in PSO funding since the economy collapsed. I am acutely aware of the concerns of many people regarding recent decisions to withdraw services to a number of intermediate locations on major routes into Dublin. Major improvements to the national roads network, including the M9 motorway, have provided the opportunity for commercial bus operators to offer improved journey times between Dublin and the regional cities in particular. Bus Éireann and other commercial bus operators have sought to amend their licences accordingly, with the consequent effect of reducing the level of service provided to a number of intermediate locations in the network. The NTA has indicated it will examine options either to reconfigure existing PSO services or to tender competitively for the provision of services to those areas affected by the changes. It must be recognised, however, that any such initiatives that involve additional PSO services would require a further increase in available funding. It should also be noted that the 2009 Act provides that the NTA must undertake a review of the operation of the licensing of public bus passenger services within five years. I understand that the NTA intends to engage in a public consultation this year on this issue, and I will examine carefully any proposed changes to the licensing regime arising from that review. I assure the Deputy that I will also be examining this very issue in the coming weeks.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	503	According to his response, the Minister has accepted that the decision is in his hands. He said the NTA will look at a reconfiguration of the public service obligation concerning these routes in such situations. It may also possibly consider a competitive tender for the provision of a route that requires a public service obligation.Taxpayers' money is required to do this and it is stated that it is subject to funding from the Minister's Department. There is no point in the NTA proceeding if the Minister is not going to provide the necessary funding. The Estimates meeting relating to the Department may already have taken place last week or it may be proceeding next week. When the Estimate for the Department comes before the House for approval, we will want to see that additional funding is being provided. Deputy McGuinness and I would like the Minister to indicate whether he gave commitments on this matter to the people he met in the past day or so. A temporary bus service, provided to get the Government over the hump until after the next general election, will be seen as just that. The public will see through any attempt to fool them for the next 12 months. Does the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Phelan, to whom the Minister referred and who is responsible for rural development, have access to funding which might help ameliorate the position? The Minister of State is presiding over the withdrawal of services from rural areas, which is her mission and which is the reason she was appointed. It is important to make that point. We know there are difficulties. The Minister cannot continue to give the €60 million or €70 million from the public service obligation to Bus Éireann, particularly in circumstances where it continues to withdraw services here, there and everywhere. Essentially, the company is now just a motorway bus operator and it is abandoning towns in every county throughout Ireland. Tipperary has been affected in this regard but the Deputies from that county will highlight that fact on another occasion. Deputy McGuinness and I are concerned about the routes from Castlecomer that run into County Laois through Crettyard, Newtown, Ballylinan and on to Athy in County Kildare. Some routes out of Carlow have already been discontinued. The Minister indicated that this matter may be reconsidered but the NTA's letter clearly states that it has approved the relevant changes. We want the Minister to provide the funding to replace the services in question.

Much of this is due to the fact that a motorway, which was needed, has been put in place and is providing quicker access across particular areas throughout the country. Bus Éireann is now using the motorway in question and this is having an effect on communities. Last night, I asked the residents I met to indicate whether there are journeys they make frequently on particular routes where the provision of services would be of help to them. I informed them that when I receive the relevant information from them, I will examine it in conjunction with representatives from the NTA in order to discover how we might respond to this issue. As the Deputy knows well, the Government that was led by his party introduced the 2009 Act under which the NTA was established. He, therefore, clearly understands how all of this works and that the NTA spends taxpayers' money which I make available to it. The legislation, which was introduced by the previous Government, gave rise to a welcome and beneficial change in the context of ensuring that we can spend taxpayers' money well. While I recognise the role played by the NTA, I also accept that this issue is the cause of frustration for people. As I outlined in my earlier contribution, the NTA will examine the position.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	519	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter in advance of the 34th anniversary of the Stardust tragedy. As we all know well, 48 people died and many more were injured on St. Valentine's Day in 1981 when a fire broke out in the Stardust nightclub in Artane. The majority of people in the Dublin Bay North constituency, particularly those who live in Artane and Coolock, have been affected in some way by this tragedy. There are many who knew, either directly or indirectly, people who lost their lives or who sustained injuries on the night in question. Some of those who live locally recall seeing the tragedy unfold as they ran towards the nightclub to assist. This incident has left its mark not only on the families and friends of those who attended the Stardust that evening, but also on the community as a whole, as people have attempted to come to terms with their grief. The exact cause of the Stardust fire has never been established and it is very difficult for families to come to terms with the fact that no one has ever been brought to justice for what happened. The initial suggestion of arson has since been disputed. In his report into the events which took place in 1981, Mr. Paul Coffey, SC, found that "the cause of the fire is unknown" and that "None of the victims of the Stardust disaster or the persons present at the Stardust on the night of the fire can be held responsible for the fire". The relatives of the victims have for far too long been awaiting answers regarding exactly what happened on the night they lost their loved ones for far too long. They are seeking the truth and they want justice for their loved ones. They believe that investigations that have taken place up to this point were flawed. In that context, they are unhappy with the Keane and the Coffey reports and they want both to be removed from the public domain. The Minister met representatives from the Stardust Victims Committee, which they very much appreciate, and listened to their concerns. In that context, I am aware that there is an ongoing Garda investigation into allegations that have been made and evidence that has been provided by some members of the committee. The families of the Stardust victims believe that new information regarding deaths that occurred some way from where the fire is thought to have started should be proof enough that a fresh investigation is required in order that the night's events might be re-examined. A researcher has discovered evidence which disputes the finding in the Keane report to the effect that the fatal fire did not start in the roof space. Rather, it is believed that the vast volume of fuel in the storeroom on the first floor, which was concealed behind a wooden wall, caused the deaths which occurred on 14 February 1981. I have been informed that the reports compiled by the researcher in question, Ms Geraldine Foy, were forwarded to the Department of Justice and Equality for investigation but that they have since been returned. There is major concern regarding the fact that an official in the Department who has no legal or technical expertise was asked to review the reports in question. The Stardust Victims Committee is concerned that they were not actually read during the 12-week period in which they were in the Department's possession. Is the Minister in a position to provide assurances that if the reports were to be returned to her Department at a later date, an official with proper and adequate expertise would actually review the evidence they contain as soon as possible? It cost a large amount of money and took a great deal of time for the evidence to which I refer to be compiled. It is only right and proper that it should be considered, in full, by the Government. I accept that what I am about to say does not relate to the Minister's Department but I wish to bring to her attention the matter of the memorial park to the victims of the Stardust fire. Sadly, the park in question is not being adequately maintained by Dublin City Council and issues arise there from time to time with regard to anti-social behaviour. That needs to be addressed properly.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	520	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Irrespective of any differences of opinion, no one disputes the magnitude of this tragedy or the impact it had on the families concerned and, as the Deputy said, the wider community. We are all conscious that the 34th anniversary of the fire falls this weekend and that this must be a particularly difficult time of year for all affected. As the Deputy will be aware, following a long campaign on the part of the victims, Mr. Paul Coffey SC was appointed in 2008, with the agreement of the Stardust Victims Committee, to review the case made by the latter for a new inquiry into the fire. Mr. Coffey publicly invited submissions from all interested parties and the committee, to which the Deputy referred, gave extensive oral evidence and made written submissions as to its case for a new inquiry. Mr. Coffey's report concluded that, in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest. While Mr. Coffey's findings were widely welcomed at the time, there has continued to be dissatisfaction, which has given rise to extensive correspondence and communications between the committee and some of its representatives and my Department and other agencies. In these communications, the committee has continued to argue for the validity of an alternative hypothesis as to the cause of the fire. I met representatives of the Stardust Victims Committee in July last year and this meeting provided me with a very good opportunity to hear their concerns at first hand. With regard to the question of any new evidence that might warrant the consideration of a further inquiry, two reports compiled by a researcher associated with the committee, who was named by the Deputy, were submitted to my Department last year. My Department was given to understand that a third and final report would be submitted in due course. However, no final report was submitted and the researcher concerned requested the return of the two reports that had been submitted. In compliance with this request, the reports were returned to the researcher. My Department has, through the Stardust Victims Committee, requested that the decision to withdraw these reports be reconsidered. I have the greatest sympathy for all those affected by the fire, as I know does everybody in this House, and I understand that those involved in the committee remain convinced that their explanation for what happened on the night is, in fact, what did occur. As I have outlined, my Department has requested that the decision to withdraw the reports be reconsidered. If these, or any other submissions, are received, they will, of course, be examined in detail and a response will be issued to the committee in due course. Allegations raised by the Stardust Victims Committee and its representatives in regard to certain matters are the subject of an ongoing investigation by An Garda Síochána. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that this is a complex investigation and, as the Deputy will understand, I cannot do anything that might cut across it. It is right, of course, that concerns about this dreadful and tragic event be raised in this House again. I again thank the Deputy for raising this matter.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	521	I thank the Minister for her response. She is well aware that the victims' families are not able to obtain closure regarding what actually happened on the night. There is a huge dispute over the findings of the two reports. Basically, the families feel the evidence provided to ensure there would be a fresh inquiry was not read by the Department and that the person examining the information had not the required legal or technical expertise to make an assessment. If the Minister could respond on this, it would be appreciated. Could she confirm whether the reports were read within the 12 weeks when they were in the possession of the Department? People are very angry and feel justice is being denied to them. They believe nobody was fully held to account over what happened on the very tragic night in question. As the Minister said, allegations were made to the Garda. Could the Minister find out whether any information is forthcoming from the Garda on when its investigation will be completed? This would be appreciated. I raised the issue of the memorial park. Perhaps the Minister could follow this up with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government because adequate funding must be found to ensure the park is appropriately maintained. It is currently dilapidated in parts and is not the fitting memorial to the victims of this terrible national tragedy that it should be.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-02-12 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	522	I am aware there remains dissatisfaction over the fact that it has not been possible to determine the true cause of the fire with certainty. I entirely sympathise with the concerns of the victims committee in this regard and I sympathise with all those who continue to be affected by the tragedy. However, the position is that an independent examination by Mr. Coffey was put in place to assess the committee's case. Substantial assistance was provided to the committee in order that it could participate in the process, and it did so. Mr. Coffey’s conclusions, as the Deputy will remember, led to motions of great significance being passed in both Houses clarifying the record as to the cause of the fire. This was extremely important, as acknowledged by everyone. Mr. Coffey concluded that there remains no actual identified evidence as to the cause of the fire. In that context, and in line with the motions, the concern is that the best another inquiry could produce would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest. However, as I have said, if any further submissions are made in this regard, they will, of course, be examined. Any reports that are given to the Department are dealt with and examined comprehensively. There is no question about that. It would be unfair to those who have suffered so much already to raise unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved at this point. However, I will certainly take up the issue the Deputy raised regarding the memorial park. I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will act upon that.
