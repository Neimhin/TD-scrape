#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I bring to the attention of the House-——
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I have called the Minister. Does the Deputy have a point of order?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The schedule circulated by the Whips clearly sets out that today's business is the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2004 — Order for Second Stage and Second Stage. My party wants to oppose the Order for Second Stage. We are told repeatedly from the Chair that the ordering of business is "a matter for the Whips". I have received a document from the Government Whip which states that the Order for Second Stage will be taken. This referendum is being forced through the House with the transparent purpose of its being put to the people in an election atmosphere. In accordance with the report of the committee chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan——
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	4	We cannot discuss this matter now. What is the point of order?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I do not propose to discuss the matter. I merely want to bring to your attention the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The committee in its sixth report recommended, for example, that even "the Standing Orders of the House should be amended so as to embody a presumption that every TD and Senator will have sufficient opportunity to make whatever contribution he or she wishes to make". The report further states:Measures should be taken to ensure that a Bill to amend the Constitution is fully debated by the Dáil. Given the importance of a constitutional amendment, every Deputy and every Senator should have the opportunity to express his or her views. The Bill therefore should be debated in principle and in detail by each House. To ensure this, the committee considered whether a minimum period for the Oireachtas debate should be specified in the Constitution.In conclusion, the report recommends that the lower limit, namely the lower limit provided in the referendum Act 1994, should not be otherwise resorted to because it is not ordinarily adequate. Moreover, its use for contentious or complex proposals might give the people the impression that they are being unduly pressed into taking a particular decision.The report is referring to the 30 to 90 days range and is saying the 30 days should not be resorted to except in emergency circumstances. I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and with the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. This is not an emergency measure but it is transparently being rushed through for base political motives. Therefore, my party will oppose the Order for Second Stage.

The Order Paper is the correct document. The Bill is down for Second Stage and the business of today and tomorrow was set by the allocation of time resolution passed by the Dáil on 8 April last. That provision provided for the times of the sittings and the business to be taken, namely, the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2004 — Second Stage. It has already been decided to take Second Stage. I call on the Minister to propose the Second Reading.

However, no order was made to take the Bill, only a decision that there would be a debate on it. The Government Whip, who is well briefed on procedures, has correctly sent us a schedule which states that an order is required because no order has been made by the House to take this Bill. There is a requirement for an order.

The question of making an order for Second Stage does not arise. I call on the Minister to proceed with Second Stage.

It is a reasonable request from these benches, which dispute that the procedures have been properly adhered to, that you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, as the protector of this House, avail of the opportunity to adjourn for 15 minutes so that proper clarification can be obtained.We will abide by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's ruling. However, we respectfully suggest that the Chair is not in full possession of all the facts. This is not the place to have this debate. I suggest that there should be an orderly suspension for at least 15 minutes so that Members can be satisfied that, in their duties and obligations, they are adhering to the highest standards of parliamentary democracy. We are not so assured. If the Constitution is to be changed, the observance of democratic procedures should at least be maintained.

The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform actually has the same understanding as Members on this side, namely, that notice was only given but that the Order for Second Stage was not made. We need clarification on this matter. If the Minister starts his contribution again, he will say the same thing. Why should we not halt proceedings for ten or 20 minutes in order to obtain clarification? We could then proceed.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The purpose of this Bill is to make an amendment to the Constitution. The amendment is very simple and proposes to restore to the Oireachtas the power to legislate as to the circumstances in which citizenship will be conferred on a child born on the island of Ireland to parents, neither of whom is an Irish citizen and neither of whom is entitled to become an Irish citizen. The Oireachtas had that power up until 1999. This Bill is designed to restore to the Oireachtas in a carefully balanced way a measure of the general power given to it under the 1937 Constitution by Article 9.1. 2° to legislate for the grant of Irish citizenship. The change would give to the Oireachtas the responsibility for specifying the circumstances in which an entitlement to Irish citizenship would arise for persons born in the island of Ireland to parents, neither of whom was entitled to be an Irish citizen.In 1996, the Constitution Review Group, the report of which I have in my hand, had considered whether it would ever be appropriate to have such right of citizenship based on birth written into the Constitution. Having carefully considered the matter, the group of experts which was chaired by Dr. T.K. Whitaker and included very many eminent, well respected legal minds, among them the then Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, senior counsel, the former Attorney General, Mr. John Rogers, senior counsel and the then future Attorney General, Mr. David Byrne, senior counsel, as well as other senior legal academics and practitioners, concluded that it would be inappropriate to insert such a provision into the Constitution. Its report stated:The Review Group, recognising that a provision on citizenship by birth necessarily includes exceptions and conditions and is correspondingly complex, is of the view that the subject is more appropriately dealt with in ordinary legislation.It concludes that a provision on the subject should not be inserted in the Article. Those words and that analysis were, I suggest, prophetic and weighty.

Let me congratulate Deputy Jim O'Keeffe on his appointment as Fine Gael spokesman on justice, a position he last held in 1979.That all-party committee set itself a work agenda and studied that report. No member of that committee at that time ever suggested that the conclusions on citizenship by birth made by that group were wrong. The report pointed to the danger of attempting to write into the Constitution a right of citizenship based on birth, without providing for the complex conditions and exceptions which would be dictated by common sense and would best be left to the statute law of the State. We do not need another expert review or another all-party committee to give us the same advice eight years later.

To be a citizen of the State is to be as Article 2 states "part of the Irish nation"; to be part of the community which forms that nation; to share the benefits and the vicissitudes that membership of that society brings with it; and to accord respect to the entity that has bestowed citizenship on the individual.

It is a complex of rights and obligations shared by people of a common nationality, and a symbol of the sovereign nature of the nation State.Governments have a duty then to safeguard the institution of citizenship to ensure that it continues to fulfil the requirements of its role as a manifestation of a nation whose people value membership of that nation. That is, for example, the reason I was able to take the opportunity, on coming into office as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to secure the agreement of my colleagues in Government to deliver the coup de grace to the scheme of investment based citizenship. In doing so I was continuing the process set in train by my predecessor, Deputy O’Donoghue, who had started winding up that scheme.

That is the reason the Government is putting forward this proposal — to eliminate an aspect of our law that exposes Irish citizenship to abuse.The nature of the abuse is that it is possible for somebody with no real connection with Ireland, North or South, to arrange affairs so as to give birth to a child in Ireland, North or South. By virtue of our laws as they currently stand, that child acquires an entitlement to Irish citizenship. That carries with it a number of important benefits for the child in question. As an Irish citizen, the person is also an EU citizen with all the rights of free movement and other treaty rights that go with that status. In addition, as an Irish citizen, the person can avail of the common travel area arrangements that exist between Ireland and its near neighbour, the UK.In international terms, this is an extraordinary situation. No other country in the world has a situation where citizenship can be acquired through this most tenuous of links with the country of citizenship and which carries with it such a wide range of free movement and other options for the citizen.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	110	Do some reading in the meantime. The aspect of our law that gives rise to this abuse is the universal entitlement of any person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and its seas, to be an Irish citizen. The position until December 1999 was that under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, every person born in the island of Ireland was an Irish citizen. This was a matter of statute law and was something that could be changed by an Act of the Oireachtas.In December 1999, however, this universal and unequivocal statement was changed in two respects. Most importantly from the point of view of the current proposal, the adoption of the new text of Article 2 of the constitution removed the question of citizenship arising from birth from the statutory to the constitutional level. The new Article 2 did so by creating an "entitlement and birthright" for every person born in Ireland "to be part of the Irish nation". The effect of this is generally accepted to be that each person born in Ireland, North or South, is entitled to be an Irish citizen.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The new Article 2, along with Article 3, arose out of the complex of agreements known as the Good Friday Agreement. The aim of the two new Articles was to replace the territorial claim made in the pre-existing Articles 2 and 3 with a formula which recognised the legitimate aspirations of all sectors of society in Northern Ireland. The British-Irish Agreement, which represents the international element of that complex of agreements, also addressed the aspirations of the people of Northern Ireland. As regards citizenship, Article 1(vi) of that agreement recognises "the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both, as they may so choose".In Annex 2 to that agreement, the two Governments declare that it is their joint understanding that the term "the people of Northern Ireland" in Article 1(vi) means, for the purpose of that provision, "all persons born in Northern Ireland and having, at the time of their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence". That means people who were born to an Irish citizen, a British citizen or to a long-term resident. Thus, a person born in Northern Ireland to parents, neither of whom is British or Irish or has a right to reside in Northern Ireland without restriction on their period of residence, is not part of the people of Northern Ireland according to the common understanding of the two Governments. However, by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution, such a person is part of the Irish nation and is entitled to citizenship. The effect of Article 2, however, is that the entitlement and birthright to be part of the Irish nation extends even to people born in Northern Ireland who are not part of the people of Northern Ireland. This is an anomalous and undesirable effect. The Government's proposals are designed to address this undesirable anomaly in a manner consistent with our international obligations under the British-Irish Agreement and within the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement as a whole. That the Government's approach is so consistent is acknowledged in the joint interpretative declaration issued by both Governments on Monday, 19 April.The undesirability of the effect to which I have referred stems from the fact that persons with no substantial links to Ireland, North or South, are arranging their affairs so as to ensure that a child is born within the island of Ireland, thus acquiring, despite the lack of association with either part of the island, an entitlement and birthright to be part of the Irish nation.

However, a number of people, including myself, were aware that the wording of Article 2 might cause problems in the future in relation to immigration policy and law. As a legal practitioner who had appeared in the Fajujonu case, it was clear to me that coupled with existing Supreme Court jurisprudence a major issue was emerging as to whether the new constitutional provision would seriously constrain the State from effectively controlling inward migration, especially by reducing the right to deport persons who had given birth to a citizen child in Ireland.

The Department of Justice, as it then was, also saw the implications in this area. For completeness, I must say that my constituency colleague, Deputy Quinn, who is here today, wrote to the Taoiseach raising the issue. One of the options canvassed by Deputy Quinn in his letter was a balancing amendment to Article 9 of the Constitution which he stated would not impinge on the Good Friday Agreement. As he put it, "On the grounds that it would not require any change to the wording at Castle Buildings, there would be no question of reopening the concluded talks process." A number of people saw this difficulty at the time.

Equally, I want to emphasise that it is almost the universal understanding of those who are active in the field of migration and in the field of maternity services in Ireland that citizenship is a very significant pull factor inducing people to come to Ireland to have children. I have heard no one of any authority deny that.It has been suggested that I have shifted my ground from the effect of this issue on maternity hospitals to its effect on the integrity of our citizenship and immigration laws. With respect to those who make that comment, I have not shifted my ground.

They are not two separate issues from which I can move, one to the other. They are two sides of the same coin. I have placed in the Library of the Oireachtas copies of the documents relating to my dealings with senior management of the maternity hospitals so that a clear picture can emerge of the nature of those dealings. Anybody who examines those documents will immediately appreciate that I have been motivated at all times by proper considerations, including the overwhelming need to avoid ammunition for racism in Irish political debate.I do not claim that all of those who give birth to Irish children here seek to remain on that basis. I am aware, anecdotally, however, of women from eastern Europe and elsewhere in the world——

The point is that an unintended effect of the wonderful achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, in advancing the peace process on this island, is the opportunity for this sort of abuse. The Government owes a duty to the people of this island to put measures in place to stop the abuse. That is what this referendum is all about.Why does it have to be done by referendum? Could the Government not just bring forward suitable amending legislation? The short answer, after a long cogitation, is "no".

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The Attorney General's strong advice, which I accept, is that any law which sought to deprive a person born in Ireland of the entitlement of citizenship, or even to postpone the right of such a person to exercise that entitlement, would be shot down by the Supreme Court as being inconsistent with Article 2. There is no alternative to addressing this issue at constitutional level. That being the case, and having given the matter deep consideration, the Government has decided that the most appropriate way of amending the Constitution is by dealing with the matter in Article 9, which already contains provisions relating to the power of the Oireachtas to legislate for the acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship.That Article 9 power extends to provisions as regards the acquisition of Irish citizenship by descent and by naturalisation, but does not allow the Oireachtas power to limit Irish citizenship acquired by birth in Ireland. The amendment proposed restores that power to some extent, but it would not allow citizenship to be redefined and qualified by statute in an unfettered way. That is not and could not be the case. Any change, as a matter of international law, must be consistent with the British-Irish Agreement, which guarantees the continuing entitlement of the people of Northern Ireland to be Irish citizens. The change to the Constitution proposed limits the scope of the Oireachtas's discretion to legislate, by confining that discretion to cases where the person is born in Ireland to parents, neither of whom is, or is entitled to be, an Irish citizen at the time of the birth. The proposal does not give rise to any reasonable fears about the identity and interests of the people of Northern Ireland or about how those matters could be addressed by future legislation.Deputies will note from the detail of the draft implementing Bill that it is intended that the statutory provisions will apply in a similar way to persons born, whether north or south, to non-national parents with lawful residence.I am confident that this House and the Seanad will be able to address the subject matter of the Bill and the Government's proposals in a most exhaustive way. By the time these proposals get to the people, their decision will have been fully informed by the parliamentary process on which we are embarking — however hesitantly — this morning. I see no reason this matter should be referred to the Joint Committee on the Constitution, since by their stances already publicly expressed on the Government's proposals, at least two of the parties represented in this House have declared their opposition. The possibility for all-party agreement is therefore nil, and any attempt to seek it now is futile. I repeat, however, that the all-party committee in 1996 and 1997, chaired by Deputy O'Keeffe, received an expert report on this subject and nobody has ever suggested since that this analysis or conclusion was wrong.People have criticised this proposal as racist.

I regard such arguments as unnecessarily scaremongering and well wide of the mark. They are arguments against ever putting this issue or any issue related to citizenship or immigration to the people.

To the extent that racism is likely to feature at all in a referendum campaign, the first of these options is in fact the most likely to engender that sort of heat since there is nothing else for the electorate to consider except the single issue. If the matter is to be put to the people along with a presidential election — about which there is a great deal of doubt as there is as yet no indication of any worthwhile opposing candidate——

To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:"Dáil Éireann:—in accordance with the recommendations of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution's report for clear and agreed procedures for the holding of referendums on constitutional amendments;—considers that political parties, North and South, view the proposal for an amendment to Article 9 of the Constitution, as impacting on Article 2 and thereby the Good Friday Agreement and the process of its present review;—believes there is a need for an All-Party Oireachtas committee to consider the Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2004, and specifically to evaluate the issues on the basis of the knowledge of experts and the presentations of the insights of groups outside the Houses and to report thereon to both Houses of the Oireachtas before 1 September 2004;declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.".This motion has been tabled by myself, Deputies Rabbitte and Sargent and the spokesmen for Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party.The Fine Gael Party acknowledges that Article 2 of the Constitution, inserted following the Good Friday Agreement, creates a potential for abuse of Irish citizenship. The Fine Gael Party shares the objective of closing off that potential abuse and is committed to working constructively with the Government and other parties to find the best resolution to that problem. The best vehicle for achieving the best solution lies in having the issue considered calmly and rationally by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. However, if the behaviour of the Minister at the start of this debate is anything to go by, the next seven weeks will see a degeneration into classic Fianna Fáil diversionary tactics in the local and European elections.Past rushed constitutional change has subsequently led to legal quagmire. I warn against future court challenges arising from this constitutional change that have not yet been foreseen. A willingness to engage constructively has not been matched by the Government. Instead of working collectively with the parties in this House and the Northern Assembly for a solution, the Government has created an adversarial and divisive climate.

However, for its own reasons, the Government has chosen to play political games with a sensitive issue. It is almost as if the Government wants a divisive and contentious debate to generate racist commentary. I find the Minister's comment that those who may be racists and who wish to vote "No" to do so is unnecessarily provocative and must be withdrawn.The Taoiseach failed to make any reference to this referendum when he answered questions to the House on 17 February for 45 minutes. He knew the Government's proposals and his action and behaviour amounted to contemptuous treatment of the Dáil. The Tánaiste has admitted that the Government has been aware of the difficulty in this area for six years. She also said that nobody foresaw these consequences in the drafting of the Good Friday Agreement.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	345	However, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform put forward an alternative wording at the time of the Agreement. The commitment in the programme for Government to initiate all-party discussions on the issue has not been met. There was no consultation with the political parties in this House or with me as party leader, despite this being a specific part of the Government decision, as announced. I admit that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform passed me in the corridor and informed me that the machines will take it. Neither has there been consultation with the political parties in Northern Ireland.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made claims about maternity hospitals yet has failed to produce conclusive supporting data. The Government pleads that its decision to hold the referendum on 11 June is not a cynical political tactic. Its failure to engage in any meaningful consultation undermines that plea. This is made all the more obvious in the absence of any coherent Government immigration strategy. The Minister's rush to this matter has been reckless and arrogant. The Tánaiste says the Government will give as much time as is requested for the substantive legislation but is not prepared to give more time and debate for a consideration of the change in the Constitution. This is completely inconsistent. If it is important to give time to the substantive legislation, which it is, surely it is equally, if not more, important to give time to debating the need for a constitutional change in the first instance.It is impossible not to interpret the Government's solo run on this issue as anything but a political stroke to shore up votes for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in the local and European elections, and to divert attention from the real issues of the economy and what is happening outside. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, would know all about that.

This is the right course of action for four reasons. The Government's failure to consult with the parties in the House has created an adversarial approach which needs to be defused. The implications of the referendum for the Good Friday Agreement have caused concern to the political parties in Northern Ireland, which will damage the review process and confidence-building there. That the Government chose to consult with the British Government while keeping the political parties in Northern Ireland in the dark fuels further suspicion. Fine Gael will outline other possible ways to deal with the issue which deserve consideration and debate. My colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe, will develop these points in his contribution. It is regrettable that he must make them here and not in the context of all-party committee consideration.Deputy Rabbitte referred to the sixth report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which recommended calm and measured debate on contentious issues, and the Government should heed that recommendation. That committee, chaired by Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, gave good advice. It recommended that measures be taken to ensure that a Bill to amend the Constitution is fully debated in the Dáil; that every Deputy and Senator should have an opportunity to express his or her views; and that where an issue is extensive and multi-faceted the Houses should consider setting up an all-party committee to prepare and publish a report. What could be more extensive and multi-faceted than the issue of citizenship, particularly given the implications for the Good Friday Agreement? We will try within the narrow time constraints imposed by the Government to have the type of constructive problem-solving dialogue which should have been conducted between the parties in recent months and attempt to turn the Government away from this unnecessarily rushed and potentially divisive referendum. Government Deputies and Senators have expressed disagreement with the date. The Tánaiste has stated that the decision to hold the referendum on 11 June was a judgment call. If so, it was the wrong call.The Minister said this morning that it would be wrong to hold a contentious referendum in conjunction with the presidential election. Surely it is worse to hold it in conjunction with local elections and those for the European Parliament when approximately 2,000 candidates are standing, which may give rise to racist commentary at some point during the campaign?

If the Government is genuine about achieving cross-party discussion, dialogue, and support it should accept this reasoned amendment and refer the matter to an all-party committee for report before 1 September. This would facilitate a referendum, if necessary before the end of the year, if that course of action were to be recommended. This is a reasonable proposal which would defuse the current adversarial and divisive debate on this sensitive issue and I urge the Government to accept the amendment.

It is quite astounding that he should quote the advice of the Constitution Review Group, the Whitaker report of 1996, to shore up his argument for an immediate amendment, in particular not to have an all-party committee examine the issue. Has he forgotten that subsequent to that report was the amendment which apparently caused the problem in 1998, put to the people by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government without the benefit of an all-party report, and that Article 2 will remain in the Constitution with various complex incoherencies possibly arising from that? Does that not relate to the need for an objective all-party examination of the issue?I also take issue with the Minister's remark to the effect that if one is a racist one should vote "No" in the referendum. I would caution him against the use of that kind of language. It is unnecessarily provocative. Many will vote "No" in this referendum for sincere reasons which may not be accepted by the Minister. His remarks are not helpful to the debate.

Our Constitution is the basic law of the State, protecting our rights and opposing tyranny. It is not the preserve of the Government or even of the Opposition; it belongs to the people. Therefore it must be amended with due deliberation. If one were amending the rules of the local flower club or cattle show, one would follow certain procedures, give due notice and have proper debate. The rules and procedures are laid down for amending the Constitution after due deliberation in the sixth progress report of the all-party committee. Underlying everything in that sixth progress report of the committee, chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, and of which I was vice-chairman, is the need for due deliberation, a careful process, informing and involving the public, ensuring that at all times there is dispassionate, objective debate, bringing the people along and listening to what they say. Unfortunately this issue is being dealt with in quite the opposite way and I am not sure why.I have heard no adequate explanation for the rush to headlong judgment to bring this before the people on 11 June. This issue has been with us since 1998, when the Minister was concerned about the amendment to Article 2. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform foresaw it at the time. I would be very interested to see the Department's papers of advice at the time.

This is not something that arose only in recent weeks as we were notified on Spy Wednesday, the Wednesday before Easter, of the Government's intention. If there is a problem, let us have a full debate on its extent. I raised a series of questions with the Minister on that issue. I received 12 pages last night, at 6 p.m., followed two hours later by a further amendment to the original package. It was a rather indigestible package to receive at supper time.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Why did the Minister take so long to respond to my legitimate queries? They came under three headings — defining the problem, exploring the options and the Government's preferred option. It is necessary to examine those points fully. The Minister either had the answers and should have given them to me straightaway or, if he did not have them, did he come to a decision without having considered all the options? The Government has promoted a constitutional referendum in an extremely narrow timeframe without reference to the all-party committee. On that issue alone, leaving aside the substantive merits of the proposed amendment, there is clear need for consideration, deliberation and analysis.The Government, however, wants to impose a timeframe which makes that impossible. It has not even offered this House and the people who voted to adopt the nineteenth amendment of the Constitution, the amendment to Article 2, an explanation of the position because it persists in its obstinate refusal to address the magnitude of its proposal. This matter has a bearing on the Constitution and on the international obligations assumed by the State, and the position of the Government gives rise to the most serious concern.It is not enough to say this proposal does not impact on the Good Friday Agreement, it is more complex and requires greater analysis. The British Government has given the Government some comfort and support on the amendment but the Good Friday Agreement was not just between the Irish and British Governments. In a technical sense, the three pages of the Agreement completed on 10 April 1998 were between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland, but the 33-page annexe to the Agreement represent the positions reached in the multiparty negotiations. There is, therefore, an interlocking between the positions reached in the multiparty negotiations and the agreement reached by the two Governments but that has been overlooked in the rush to judgment on this referendum. It is correct that the only legal obligations arising are between the two Governments but there are political obligations as a consequence of the multiparty arrangements and those obligations have not been discharged.At minimum, this proposal should have been discussed with the parties to those multiparty negotiations and that has not happened. Mark Durkan of the SDLP has come out strongly on the issue. On 7 April he was handed a document that was not a consultation or discussion document and that is no way to do business or amend the Constitution. I ask the Minister and his colleagues in Government to have more respect for the Constitution and the complex issues related to Northern Ireland and not to rush to judgment and put this issue before the people on 11 June.The Minister can say the proposal does not directly impinge on Article 2 of the Constitution. If so, should we not deal with an amendment to Article 2? There is, however, an indirect impact on Article 2 because there is a restriction of the rights included in it, raising the question of what might happen to someone who has rights under Article 2 but does not have rights under the amended Article 9. If someone is part of the Irish nation under Article 2 but does not have citizenship under Article 9, what will that mean? An Irish national will not have Irish citizenship. Will that person be entitled to reside in Ireland?I raise this as an issue that should be teased out. The Government has not examined it properly. It is on my next list of questions for the Minister when he has replied to my 34 preliminary questions. There are many other issues that need to be resolved and rushing this Bill through the House is no way to do that. Many of us want to see the problem fully examined and the best solution reached. The Government's haste could result in the worst of all worlds — an amendment of the Constitution that will not resolve the problem and that might make it worse.There is a European dimension to this issue. Under European laws and regulations, citizenship is a matter for the member states. The Government, however, proposes most favoured nation status to the 50 million inhabitants of the United Kingdom, giving exceptional rights to one member state beyond the others. It will open up our citizenship pool to 50 million citizens of the United Kingdom. Are we discriminating against the other 23 member states of the European Union by granting most favoured nation status to the citizens of one other member state? How does that fit in with the principle of equality in the EU context?Before changing the Constitution, which should always be done with due deliberation, we should examine possible alternatives. These alternatives should fit into the development of an overall immigration policy that looks with a humanitarian aspect at the issues of labour requirements, work permits, rights of residence and citizenship. That backdrop has been ignored.We should examine the extent of the problem. I am still unsure if there is a problem in our maternity hospitals, with the integrity of our citizenship or the health and welfare of pregnant mothers from abroad and their offspring who are born here — the three reasons the Government has advanced for the proposed amendment. These issues should be explored to see if we can resolve them by legislation. The Minister will shake his head on that.

What about carrier liability? When I asked if consideration had been given to alternative means of deterring such persons from arriving in Ireland, the Minister in the package he sent to me last night referred to carrier liability arrangements designed to prevent the arrival in Ireland of persons without proper passports or visas. These provisions, however, do not apply to arrivals from the UK common travel area. We are an island nation. If we can secure co-operation from the UK to get this declaration about the Good Friday Agreement — and I would like to see similar co-operation on Sellafield and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings — can we not explore co-operation in carrier liability arrangements?Women who are heavily pregnant are allowed to board aeroplanes. Can we introduce further restrictions in that regard? While I am sure Mr. Michael O'Leary and Mr. Willie Walsh will not wish to hear me suggest such a thing, is it not an option provided it can be implemented on an all-island basis?

There are no direct flights to Dublin from Lagos, Bucharest, Manila or any of the other places to which the Minister has referred.A possible legislative approach has been dealt with in some detail by Mr. Colm MacEochaidh, a colleague of the Minister at the Bar and a member of Fine Gael. He argues coherently that as no court or judge has declared definitively that Article 2 has the meaning contended by the Government, it is possible to introduce legislation to impose restrictions. If necessary, such legislation could be referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26. That argument has not been fully teased out. Mr. MacEochaidh makes the point that the decision to hold a referendum in circumstances where the need to alter the Constitution is not clearly and unambiguously established offends the idea of a constitution. Mr. MacEochaidh's basic point is that it is possible to introduce legislation to amend the Citizenship Act. If there are questions as to its constitutionality and the impact thereon of Article 2, the issue can be referred to the Supreme Court on the basis of the President's dissatisfaction. An adjudication can be arrived at there.The advantage of such a course of action is that a Supreme Court decision would permit us to be quite clear as to the nature of the problem and the necessary extent of the minimal intervention in the Constitution required to bring it within the principle established by the court. That is one of many options which should be considered in the context of an all-party Oireachtas committee examination of the issue.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The Deputy has two minutes remaining.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	370	That is part of the problem. There are many aspects of the matter which I would like to bring to the attention of the House which could more sensibly and reasonably be considered in the context of an all-party Oireachtas committee examination.I return to a point I made earlier. If the problem has arisen as a result of Article 2 of the Constitution, it seems the Minister is proposing to amend it by the back door. The amendment will restrict the application of Article 2. The source of the problem as expounded by the Minister appears to be Article 2. If Article 2 is the problem, it should be addressed in an honest and up-front manner. While that would necessitate wider consultation with Northern and British parties, such consultations should be commenced if that is what is needed. Fine Gael accepts that there is a problem and is genuinely committed to remedying it. We wish to find the best solution. If that takes time, we should accept it. We should never rush to amend the Constitution. The Minister should consider a direct amendment to Article 2 containing the very words he wishes to include in Article 9. Such an amendment would have the effect of eliminating an incoherence between an amended Article 9 and the existing Article 2.Another possibility would be to limit the broad scope of Article 2 by inserting into it the one Irish citizen-parent requirement. There are a number of legislative and constitutional possibilities which should be considered in a calm, deliberative manner. That is not happening. I urge the Minister to consider fairly and seriously the proposal of Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party. It is made in good faith and reflects the prescribed methodology of the sixth report of the all-party committee. While the Minister might not achieve consensus if the constitutional issue is dealt with in that manner, he will at least have ensured that all issues are fully resolved. A report will result to provide a proper basis on which to make further progress.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	371	It is eight weeks since the Taoiseach told the Dáil that his Government had no plans to hold a constitutional referendum this year unless one was required on Europe. However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was able to tell the nation a few weeks ago that he had been working on a proposal for this referendum since 2002. The day after the Government's proposals were published, it was still insisting publicly that no date had been set for a referendum despite the fact that in January secret provision was made to accommodate a third issue at the polls on 11 June. I wrote that day to the Taoiseach to say the issues involved in the referendum required a rational debate in a calm environment. I wrote that the Labour Party was prepared to consider the terms of any referendum and accompanying detailed legislative proposals in as non-partisan a manner as possible. I also explained that the acid test for the party would be the Government's willingness to de-couple the referendum matter from the impending elections. A majority wants to see this happen. The Government has, however, decided to proceed in as partisan a way as possible.Ministers' speeches on the subject have become more and more aggressive and untrue and misleading claims have been made about consultation. The issue is beginning to find its way into election literature in ways which make it clear that the issue of citizenship is to be seen as symbolic of the Government's overall approach to immigration. Ministers are going around the place saying this is a simple and reasonable proposition, a notion repeated this morning by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — as he acknowledges by nodding his head. In unnecessarily intemperate exchanges with my colleague, Deputy Burton, the Minister said in the House that one could not run a controversial referendum like this during a presidential election. I will be checking the Official Report to confirm that. It is a simple proposition in one context but a controversial referendum in another.Ministers say that all they wish to do is restore to the Oireachtas the right to legislate in an important area. For seven years, the Government has taken every conceivable step it could to remove all power from the Houses of the Oireachtas and any other organ of public accountability. The very sanitised nature of the proceedings here today and the way in which this Parliament is being obliged to conduct itself in this debate give the lie to the claim by Ministers that they are only interested in returning power to the Oireachtas. I take legislation and the abuse of the law seriously. I am very much aware of a broad public perception that there is a loophole in our law which is being abused. If that is the case, there will and ought to be legitimate public concern. However, it is fundamentally wrong that a succession of Ministers has used a single statistic to exaggerate the size of this loophole in the public mind.Instead of giving us true facts and figures, the Government relies on the totally misleading mantra that one in four births in Dublin hospitals last year was to a non-national mother. The non-national mothers in question were, among others, American, Dutch, French, German, Filipino, Russian, Nigerian, Canadian, British, New Zealanders, Australian and Japanese. The vast majority were living and working in Ireland in perfectly legal circumstances. While the Government's referendum and the legislation accompanying it will not change that by one iota, I am sure people will not be told that on their doorsteps. In other words, if this referendum is passed, the number of births to non-nationals in Dublin hospitals will remain as near possible to one in four. The difficulties of resources, staffing, accompanying health difficulties and language will continue to exist. What will be the Government's next response?It is the children of women arriving late in pregnancy, giving birth for the sole reason of claiming citizenship for their child, who are the ostensible targets of this referendum, and not even all such women, because the legislation published by the Minister makes it clear that a child born in Ireland of a British parent will in future have entitlement to Irish citizenship, and offers no basis whatever of proof of parentage. I read in this morning's newspapers in the letter to Deputy O'Keeffe that the total number of non-EU, non-national mothers arriving in late pregnancy at the National Maternity Hospital last year was 163 — approximately three a week. Even if we assume that each one of them was here to try to secure citizenship for their child, is it for this we are being asked to change the Constitution?If this is the extent of the problem, why has no solution been canvassed other than a change in our fundamental law? Why is it that heavily pregnant women, according to anecdote usually travelling alone and often in distress, are allowed to board aircraft to Ireland without the remotest comment? If trafficking is involved, why is it that there is no attempt to find out from the women who arrive here how the arrangements were made, and how they found out about this so-called loophole? Since 2000, trafficking in illegal immigrants has been punishable by up to ten years in prison and-or an unlimited fine. How many persons have been arrested for or convicted of this offence?I told my party's weekend conference that Ireland needs, and has needed for some years, an immigration policy. The issue of citizenship is obviously related to the whole issue of immigration, and it makes no sense to tackle one without the other — unless, of course, political propaganda and spin will be employed to convey the impression that the people are really being asked to vote on a "get tough on immigrants" policy. A rational, colour-blind policy that takes account of Ireland's needs, and that is willing to allow and enable people to make a better life here, requires all-party support for its development. Instead we are approaching the issue in a highly-charged, selective and partisan way. We will regret that. It is entirely disingenuous to posit in this House that because two parties have so far declared opposition to the referendum that the matter could not be studied by an all-party committee.Ireland's history was shaped in many ways by emigration. The coffin ships of the 19th century were replaced by the mail boat in the 20th century. In both eras there were destinations that were willing to make Irish people welcome. Are we now to send a coded signal to the rest of the world that none of their huddled masses is to be made welcome here? I will return to this subject later. I must first address the other area in which this referendum can only do damage.The referendum on the Good Friday Agreement was the only occasion in the history of our State when all the voters on the island of Ireland had an opportunity to vote on an Agreement that, among other things, resulted in a change to our Constitution. If for no other reason than that — and there are other reasons to which I will refer — we should not readily agree to any unilateral attempt to override that outcome, without even notice to, let alone consultation with, the other parties to that Agreement.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The Government may have been engaged over the past couple of days — and the Minister's excited condition is testament to it — in spinning madly the assertion that because the British Government is not bothered, there is no difficulty with the Good Friday Agreement. To help the spinning, it has tried as hard as possible to create confusion between the British-Irish Agreement and the multi-party talks agreement, implying that only one was relevant to this debate. As part of that process, it has secured the agreement of the British Government to a so-called legal interpretation.I challenge the Government now to publish all the legal advice available to it on this matter. I challenge the Government to publish not only the Attorney General's advice received by the Government in the course of its preparation of the referendum proposal, but also all correspondence behind this so-called legal interpretation. This House, and the people, are entitled to read in full all the argumentation put forward to the Government by its legal advisers in this matter.This week, both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have slipped into their press comments sly references to the British-Irish Agreement when asked questions about the Good Friday Agreement. They are desperately trying to create a confusion between the two. The British-Irish Agreement is an international treaty and binding between the two sovereign states in the normal way. However, it has, as an annex, the multi-party talks agreement, the outcome of so many weeks of negotiation at Castle Buildings at Stormont.The multi-party talks agreement, which deals in detail with strands 1, 2 and 3, rights, equality and so on, would not have of itself any binding status as a treaty, since it was not entered into between parties competent to contract in the international arena. However, the British-Irish Agreement is not capable of being interpreted without reference to the multi-party talks agreement. Given the entirely bound together nature of the two, it is impossible to argue that the two documents should not be read together as a coherent whole.For example, the text of the proposed changes to Articles 2 and 3 of our Constitution were set out, in full, in the multi-party talks agreement, but its adoption, by Government order, is referred to in the British-Irish Agreement as the trigger that brings all the institutions, strands 1, 2 and 3, on line. They are both integral parts of the overall Good Friday package. The first part of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties is relevant in this respect. It provides as follows:1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: . . .As I pointed out, the multi-party talks agreement is an annexe to the British-Irish Agreement, so the international treaty must be interpreted by both the British and Irish Governments in good faith in its context, which includes its preambles and annexes. We are entitled to know on what legal basis the joint "legal interpretation" from the British and Irish Governments feels free to depart from that principle, all the more so because this so-called legal interpretation represents a fundamental change in the legal understanding of the Government. On 20 April 1998 the Taoiseach wrote to my predecessor, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, stating: "The proper interpretation of the two opening sentences of the new Article 2 is that they confer on every person born in the island of Ireland an entitlement and birthright to Irish nationality and hence to citizenship." He went on to state in that letter that "considerations of peace in Northern Ireland would outweigh any concerns relating to immigration". This morning the Minister said that was a matter of political judgment in the context of the time, implying that if he had been in the Taoiseach's place he would have done differently. That seems an entirely inadequate explanation of the reply given to Deputy Quinn's questions at the time.How, in the light of that, can the Government now sign up to a "legal interpretation" with the British Government stating that "it was not their intention in making the said agreement that it should impose on either government any obligation to confer nationality or citizenship on persons born in any part of the island of Ireland whose parents do not have sufficient connection with the island of Ireland?" It is clear from the letter of 1998 that not only did they know what the intention was, they knew what the consequence would be, accepted it fully and went into it with their eyes wide open. It is fundamentally dishonest now to claim that this was all somehow unanticipated.The Government's dishonesty goes deeper than that. On 14 May that same year, my predecessor asked the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the Dáil whether his Department intended to change the ground rules for Irish citizenship, because leaks to that effect had appeared in the newspapers. The Minister replied that a recommendation had been made by an interdepartmental committee to consider legislation that might eliminate the possibility of citizenship being granted to babies born to non-national mothers here. However, he said that matter, "will fall to be considered in the light of the agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations on 10 April and its implementation". The Taoiseach referred specifically to that reply in a further letter to Deputy Quinn on 21 May 1998, the day before the Good Friday referendum, stating, "I can assure you that in the event of the new Articles 2 and 3 taking effect, no legislation will be proposed by this Government to the Oireachtas which imposes restrictions on the entitlement to Irish nationality and citizenship of persons born in Ireland."Did the Government bring that correspondence to the attention of the British Government when it was seeking the political cover of the legal interpretation after running into difficulty over recent weeks and finding this referendum was not the cakewalk its inspirers thought it to be? Did the Government tell the British Government it has always been aware that the consequence of changing Articles 2 and 3 would be to confer nationality, and hence citizenship, on every person born on the island of Ireland, and that it had always accepted this consequence? I doubt it. I repeat that those trying, as senior members of Government have in recent days, to convince the nation that they had never foreseen this consequence are simply not telling the truth.We amended Article 2 of the Constitution in 1998 to preserve the rights of those from Northern Ireland to be Irish citizens, which was an integral part of the peace process, replacing the so-called "territorial claim". However, the Minister now proposes to amend Article 9 of the Constitution to directly override Article 2. No honest interpretation is possible except that this amounts to a unilateral amendment of the Good Friday Agreement.We know from the Minister that the Northern parties were not consulted — they were simply informed. However, they have sat up and taken notice, including at least one party that never supported the Agreement in the first place and would welcome any precedent showing that the Agreement could be re-written at will by anyone.The fact that the British Government is prepared, no doubt for its own reasons, to sign up to a legal interpretation at variance with the facts is not the point. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have rejected concerns expressed about the citizenship referendum. They are both reported to have said the referendum would not cause any difficulty with the Agreement. However, each of them was careful enough to specify on tape that it would not cause any difficulty "with the British-Irish Agreement". This is the significant point the Government seems to be relying on. It is saying, in effect, that if the British Government has no problem from the point of view of the British-Irish Agreement — the only legally binding document in terms of international law — then a breach of the multi-party talks agreement is of no legal significance, since that document is a political rather than a legal document. This makes one wonder what is going on in the wider peace process at present which, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said, is a matter we do not have time to discuss today.The attempted separation of the international treaty from the domestic political outcome of the Good Friday talks has no validity. The reality is that the elements of the Good Friday Agreement are inextricably part of the same package. The legal compact must be interpreted in the context it was arrived at, which includes its annexes. What, therefore, is going on in Irish constitutional terms? On the one hand, one would be entitled, by virtue of birth in Ireland, to be part of the Irish nation. On the other hand, notwithstanding any other provision of the Constitution, one could be stripped of the entitlement to both citizenship and nationality. Would one still, in some grandiloquent but meaningless gesture, be part of the Irish nation while, at the same time, not entitled to Irish nationality and citizenship?There is only one precedent of which I can think. As Humpty-Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone when he met Alice through the looking-glass, "When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less". However, while Humpty-Dumpty was pontificating along these lines to poor Alice, he was sitting on a wall. We all know what happened after that.If we consider a group of people who under Article 2 have an entitlement and birthright to be part of the Irish nation, we can see how this amendment would operate in practice, for example, how it would apply to a small group such as sportsmen. Steve Heighway, I understand, had neither Irish parents nor grandparents. He was entirely fortuitously born in Ireland. John Aldridge and Andy Townsend have two Irish grandparents between them. While Jason Sherlock has an Asian father and Paul McGrath is black, they both have Irish mothers. Paul McGrath was born abroad.All of these individuals are part of the Irish nation. Indeed, how many times in the past have we all been proud to share nationhood with each of these individuals? However, what is the Government's cut-off point? Which of these five people should not in future be accepted as part of the Irish nation? Would it be the fortuitous birth, the grandparent rule or the child born outside marriage abroad? It is not good enough to say that the rule is not retrospective. If one does not want it to happen in future, it is because one thinks it should not have happened in the past.It is striking that we propose to remove the rule of entitlement to citizenship by virtue of being born in the Coombe Hospital in the Liberties in Dublin, while holding on to the rule that an Irish-born grandparent can be produced by someone from Cricklewood or the Bronx to guarantee exactly the same result. Is there not a certain irony to the fact that a Fianna Fáil-led Government is seeking to amend Mr. de Valera's Constitution in order to remove an anomaly and cure an unintended citizenship advantage conferred purely by an accident of birth? It was Mr. de Valera's US citizenship that saved him from execution in 1916 — a citizenship that the infant son of two immigrants of uncertain status automatically acquired solely by reason of the fact that Mr. de Valera was born in New York.The effect of this proposal is to create a "doughnut" form of citizenship entitlement, whereby those born in the heart of the capital city of this country can be excluded from citizenship, while there will remain far more people born abroad entitled to Irish citizenship than there are people entitled to it by birth in Ireland. They are entitled under the grandparent rule and there are millions of them, but the Government has no plans to amend that rule because most beneficiaries of that rule are English-speaking and white — some of them might even be good enough to play for Ireland.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I take our Constitution, and the process of amending it, seriously. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution reported on the referendum process and set out clear and agreed procedures for the holding of referenda on constitutional amendments — agreed procedures that cannot possibly be complied with in order to meet this artificial and suddenly imposed 11 June deadline.There has not been a Green Paper on citizenship, nor consultation with the Opposition parties, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution or the human rights commissions, North or South. There have not been, and there are no plans for, public hearings on the factual issues said to give rise to the need for this referendum campaign. Nonetheless, we need to hear from all the interested parties. We should hear from the national immigration bureau of the Garda Síochána, the maternity hospitals, the health and social welfare services and other statutory agencies, and also from NGOs and advocacy groups. We could then arrive at an informed view.While this is what public hearings should be about, they will not happen. There will simply not be enough time for a fully-informed debate on the proposal with only eight weeks until election day, time which was intended to be devoted to local and European issues.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform first sought to justify the referendum on the basis that the masters of the maternity hospitals had pleaded with him for it because so many non-national mothers were presenting late in labour. However, the masters went on the public record and contradicted this. On Tuesday last, however, we were able to read selected minutes, documents, correspondence and records apparently suggesting that the Minister was right all along. The Minister's selective leaks suggest nothing of the kind. He misrepresented the context and content and who initiated the meeting, and he was wrong about the date. I am sorry if I used the word "lie" in this regard. I only did so concerning the Minister's misrepresentation of the date. I withdraw the word "lie" and say that it was untrue. The Minister knows the date was in October 2002 not 2003, and he well knows the significance of that.The Minister has been asked repeatedly to provide figures to show the numbers of non-national women arriving at hospitals late in labour and giving birth in Ireland purely for the purpose of securing citizenship rights for their children. He was unable to do so, although he was clearly in possession of figures, as we now know from his reply to my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, in today's newspapers. They did not help his case and that is why he did not offer them in debate. Oddly, he was able to state in great detail the exact number of babies born to Nigerian parents and last summer on the radio he was able to tell us that "you only have to have eyes in your head to see the scale of the problem". However, the only thing our eyes can identify for us is colour. It would be terribly unjust to accuse the Minister of facilitating those who play the race card.The Minister has not explained what abuse of citizenship law is taking place. What is its nature and scale? Even if women are being flown in just to give birth, although we still do not have details about that, we must remember that giving birth to a child here confers no rights on the mother or father. The non-national parents of Irish born children do not have the right to live here on the basis of their child's citizenship. Despite his denials this morning, the Minister did a U-turn on the motivation for the referendum. He switched from the pressure on the maternity hospitals to the need to protect the integrity of Irish and EU citizenship law and then back to the grossly misleading mantra of the number of non-national births in our maternity hospitals.As regards the integrity of EU citizenship law, we know from a reply by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to a question in the Dáil that no such concern has been raised at any formal level with the Government by any other member state of the EU. In any event, there is little enough integrity to a citizenship and immigration law that lacks any clear statutory underpinning or framework. The Minister has promised comprehensive legislation on immigration since he came into office. However, we are still waiting. Instead of producing an immigration code, he and his predecessor have concentrated on new and easier ways of deporting people. Even the new legislation on work permits, which was promised for more than a year, has still not appeared. The Minister told us he has had this proposal in mind and has been working on it since 2002.

However, the best he can do is a further promise to amend the legislation which will be brought into the House if the referendum is carried to outlaw passports for sale. There has already been Private Members' legislation on this issue in the name of Senator Quinn. There is no complex draughtsmanship involved. We are entitled to be suspicious about this and to wonder whether the Government cares about the integrity of citizenship enough to deal with this issue.I am convinced that rushing into a referendum on the same date as the local and European elections, without any period for reflection or consultation, is the worst way to change our Constitution and citizenship law. We have seen the huge problems a botched and hasty referendum can cause. We should not be in any doubt about this. Bruce Morrison said last week that this proposal could encourage people to exercise their worst instincts about newcomers rather than their best. Candidates on doorsteps whispering about how they will get rid of the people who get everything the State can hand out will only exacerbate that tendency. The Government knows that.

They are right to feel abused, aggrieved and angry about the situation in which they find themselves and about the run-down streets and estates, the poor or absent medical services, the missing policing, the petty crime, the heroin and anti-social behaviour. Government candidates are now preparing to tell them that it is all the fault of the non-nationals or aliens, as they used to be called. Faced with the prospect of a drubbing at the voting booths, the Government has decided to say cynically to the people that it is the only one dealing with the immigrants because the others want to open the door wide and let them all in.Faced with the prospect that the politics of fear can do immense damage and with the reality that we may be about to unleash a racist undertone, to put it no more strongly than that, I must make two points. The Labour Party is prepared to play its part in addressing whatever abuse the Minister can substantiate. The Labour Party is not in favour of an open door policy and it does not believe that everyone who lands in Ireland is entitled to receive an Irish passport, whether in the Shelbourne Hotel or in the Rotunda Hospital. The Labour Party is willing to play a constructive role in addressing the issue in the framework envisaged by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I do not expect the Minister will accept my offer. That would be to deny the transparent purpose of this referendum being taken at this time.For all the reasons I have given, from the initial deception of the Dáil by the Taoiseach on 17 February up to yesterday's desertion by the Tánaiste of the previously held Progressive Democrats' position and because any Government that would unnecessarily add to the difficulties already surrounding the Good Friday Agreement does not deserve support, the Labour Party will oppose this referendum.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	385	The Green Party supports the amendment to put the citizenship proposal before the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. The Minister should not be too worried about the position of the Opposition parties in that regard. The Green Party's call to reject the Government proposal was contingent on the Government's determination to proceed at the local and European elections and on the need for a wider debate. If we could have a wider debate, all bets would be off and the Minister might get the consensus he sought.The Green Party and the majority of Irish citizens support a managed, fair, transparent and rights-based immigration regime. This applies to any essential reforms of our system which might have implications for immigration and citizenship. There is popular recognition that our system is in need of attention. However, the debate on proposals for change must be based on facts. Any change to policy must be strictly evidence based. My party believes that the best way to ensure this debate is conducted on the basis of facts and with a view to an exhaustive and rigorous examination of all the implications arising from the Government's proposals, including those for the Good Friday Agreement, is to refer this matter at once to the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution.The Taoiseach and the Government must recognise the need for such a debate. There is a widely held view that the Government's determination to hold the citizenship referendum on the date of the local and European elections is based on cynical electoral calculations through Fianna Fáil research, which highlights the importance of immigration as an issue among the electorate. I put it to the Government parties that if they are sincere in their determination to conduct a reasoned debate on these issues, they should join us in condemning the election candidate in the Dublin area who has already issued a leaflet containing a deliberate misrepresentation of the Opposition parties' position, which is calculated to inflame and promote xenophobia.The serious issues raised in this debate cannot and must not be addressed on the basis of myths, which feed prejudice, or confusion, which is promoted by the Government's muddled approach to policy making and enforcement. Our Irish citizenship is too precious for that. The Government claims that the integrity of our citizenship system is at stake. It is the view of the Green Party that the integrity of our public is now also at stake in the wake of the Government's handling of these issues. At the heart of our identity as a republic, we have set our faith against any form of sectarian or racist exclusion. Our republic aspires to celebrate inclusion and diversity. Our vision of citizenship and identity is both Irish and global in its reach.In a report commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform from the international organisation on migration, the significance of the issue is well understood. It states that the questions of a country's citizenship and of the circumstances in which it may be acquired, whether by right or as a privilege, are often questions of a highly philosophical and political nature which may go to the heart of a nation's perception of its own identity. The Government is proposing to interfere with Irish citizenship laws which have existed since the foundation of the State. Moreover, our traditional common law approach to acquiring citizenship is part of our inheritance as a republic. Any policy changes to be introduced in laws concerning citizenship and immigration must be fair, well thought out and evidence-based. We note with alarm that the statistics to support the Minister's core claims regarding citizenship tourism are not wholly available in terms of Ireland. The Minister said as much earlier and, subsequent to his initial claims, he has been forced to shift the ground of his argument for change. These are not the actions of a man with evidence in pursuit of conviction, they are those of a man filled with misplaced conviction in pursuit of evidence — any evidence or argument will do.A gap as big as the hole in the ozone layer has opened up in the Minister's argument, not to mention his credibility as an advocate. His Department published statistics for the Dublin maternity hospitals, including the number of births in 2003 to non-nationals, namely, 4,824 or 25% of the total number of births in public hospitals in Dublin. Upon this and other statistics, the Department came to the conclusion that "There are also very obvious implications for the future of Irish immigration policy and for the maintenance of the integrity of Irish law on immigration and residence." Only later did the Minister, Deputy McDowell, concede, upon questioning from a journalist that while 25% of births in Dublin's maternity hospitals were to non-nationals, some of these were to citizens of other EU states and people here on work permits and only one third of them were to people in the asylum process. In other words, the Minister has conceded that the precise breakdown which would give evidence of the extent of the so-called citizenship tourism phenomenon is not available. It is no wonder that the Minister has been forced to back-pedal and state that he is not pinning his hat on the issue of statistics from maternity hospitals.The Minister's claims on behalf of the masters of the maternity hospitals that they pleaded for a change in the law were flatly contradicted by those individuals. The masters countered that they had neither sought a meeting nor had they pleaded for a change in the law. Not surprisingly, the masters of the maternity hospitals confined themselves to issues they know best. Not least among these are the medical risks to which young mothers are exposing themselves and their unborn children by presenting late in their pregnancies.In March the Minister proposed a new referendum on the Constitution based on an assertion that there is a growing crisis in our maternity hospitals, particularly those in Dublin. Just a few weeks later, he has shifted the grounds of his argument to such a degree that the maternity hospitals have become a side issue. He stated that this is "not an issue about maternity hospitals". The way he is going, this issue will quickly become an end to his career.The Minister's record on these issues can only reinforce widely held suspicions about the motives of this Government. I refer here to motivations driven by electoral calculations and an appeal to the fears of the misinformed and the prejudiced. This is the Minister who has brought us a number of debacles which have fed a growing unease with the state of our immigration laws and their enforcement. For example, Deputy McDowell was behind the forced deportation of Irish-born children together with their non-national parents, following the abolition of those parents' right to apply for residency in Ireland. In the words of Ray Dooley, chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance, "Irish citizen children must not be forced into situations where they may be exposed to a risk of torture, extreme poverty or hardship".The Minister's Immigration Act 2004 has been described by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties as draconian in nature, lacking in basic safeguards and divorced from the practical operation of the immigration system. The Act was clearly inspired by the Aliens Act 1935, the origins of which can be traced back to the Aliens Restriction Act 1911 — a legal instrument drawn up by Britain in a time of emergency to prevent German spies infiltrating the country. These are the kind of actions which have led former US Congressman, Bruce Morrison, to describe the Government's asylum and immigration system as hopelessly inefficient. Mr. Morrison also stated that "There is so much work to be done to bring together a coherent immigration policy in Ireland rather than jump into a referendum."The Human Rights Commission, specifically in the person of Maurice Manning, has expressed preliminary concerns about the referendum, including the possibility that it might be inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement. The joint declaration by the British and Irish Governments has done nothing to reassure us. The leader of the SDLP, Mark Durkan, has also expressed deep reservations about the Government's unilateral move to undo carefully negotiated arrangements under the Good Friday Agreement. This is a time of deep political uncertainty about the future of the Agreement, its institutions and its status vis-à-vis, for example, the Democratic Unionist Party’s continuing insistence that it is up for renegotiation. Not for the first time, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, finds himself playing into the hands of the Unionist enemies of the Good Friday Agreement.The Green Party believes that Bruce Morrison put his finger on the nub of the question when he stated that governments often excuse their lack of enforcement of laws by writing new laws that will not be enforced either. Constitutional referenda should not be used to cover up the failings of Ministers and we do not believe the people want the Constitution abused in this way. In this matter, as in so many others, the Government is the author of its own misfortune. The Government parties have contributed significantly to the confusion, to the irregular and contested enforcement of existing immigration regulations and, ultimately, to the lack of transparency that feeds the misinformation and prejudice surrounding the issue of immigration and asylum seekers in Ireland.Instead of addressing its own role in creating confusion and feeding prejudice through its incompetent management of the immigration issue, the Government is preparing to further exploit the consequences of its own incompetence. This is what lies behind Bruce Morrison's comment that to ask voters to decide in a vacuum with inadequate enforcement of existing laws is to invite them to exercise their worst instincts about newcomers rather than their best. That is what is dangerous about this referendum and it is why my party supports the amendment to Second Stage referring this matter to the Oireachtas committee on the Constitution.

I appeal to it not to seek to make this profound change in the Constitution and in the Good Friday Agreement, for which the people voted by an overwhelming majority in 1998. If the Government refuses to listen to the wide range of opinion throughout the country and in the Oireachtas calling on it to relent, then Sinn Féin will campaign vigorously for a "No" vote. I wish to indicate the support of Sinn Féin for the amendment tabled by Fine Gael, Labour and the Green Party.In promoting this rushed referendum the Government is stirring the pot of ignorance, fear and bigotry which produces outright racism. In holding the referendum in conjunction with local and EU elections, Government members may hope to benefit their parties electorally. However, they will only do so at the expense of civil rights, community relations and the Good Friday Agreement. This is the work of an irresponsible Government.The component parts of this Government were keen promoters of the passports for sale scheme, better described as a scandal.

The Government had no statistical basis for its claim of a crisis number of births and a widespread abuse of citizenship law. It has yet to produce the evidence. Even if it is accepted that there is such a problem, it is wrong to assert that it can only be rectified by a referendum which will fundamentally alter our citizenship laws and our Constitution.I charge the Government with deliberate deception of the Oireachtas and of the people. On 17 February last I asked the Taoiseach on the floor of the Dáil if it was intended to hold a referendum or referenda in 2004 to change the Constitution. I want to remind the Dáil of exactly what the Taoiseach said, namely:The Government has no proposals at present to hold a referendum to change the Constitution. The position continues to be held under review in light of developments, including: the outcome of the examination by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution of property rights issues; the outcome of the study being conducted by a sub-committee on procedures and privileges on reform of the Seanad; and the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference on the draft constitutional treaty which commenced in Rome on 4 October.The Taoiseach's answer could not have been clearer. No proposals to hold a referendum and no mention of citizenship or the Good Friday Agreement. He also told the Dáil that "The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question."Today, however, the Taoiseach and his representatives are asking the Oireachtas and the people to endorse a complex referendum proposal with profound consequences for citizenship rights and the Good Friday Agreement and without referral to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. There has been no prior consultation with the political parties North or South, no engagement with civil society, no research, no evidence, no White Paper, no Green Paper and no real debate. That is the reality.Did the Taoiseach tell the Dáil the truth on 17 February 2004? We now know that on 14 January 2004, the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on instructions from the Minister, Deputy Cullen, wrote to the Department of Finance informing it that 300 further electronic voting machines had been ordered because "there are strong indications that there may be a further ballot paper at the June polls. This would increase time of voters at voting machines." What did the Minister know that we did not know on 14 January? Did the Taoiseach know it?Even if this letter had not come to light under the Freedom of Information Act, thanks to Irish Citizens for Trustworthy E-voting, there would still be a huge question for the Taoiseach to answer, which quite simply is this. Does he expect us to believe that on 17 February — only nine weeks ago — he was not aware that this constitutional amendment and its associated complex legislation were in preparation and that, at the very least, there was a possibility that they would be put to a referendum this year? If he knew that, then he clearly misled the Dáil on 17 February. Those are the 
    facts.I will turn now to the implications of this constitutional amendment for the Good Friday 
  Agreement. By the very manner the Government has proceeded so far, and before the proposal is even put to a vote, it has damaged and undermined the Agreement.The Government undertook no prior consultation with the parties that negotiated the Agreement, including Sinn Féin which is the largest pro-Agreement party in the Six Counties. Like Sinn Féin the SDLP has expressed its opposition to this referendum proposal. Thus we have the two parties representing virtually all Nationalists in the Six Counties speaking out against the Government's proposed course of action.Citizenship by birthright was enshrined in the amended Article 2 of the 1937 Constitution to guarantee the right to Irish citizenship of people born in the Six Counties. Yet, the Government is ignoring the political representatives of those in the Six Counties who value their Irish citizenship. Not for the first time, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell has handed Dr. Ian Paisley and the Democratic Unionist Party a priceless political gift. They were told solemnly by both Governments that the Agreement would not be re-negotiated but now the DUP asserts almost daily that the Agreement can be changed at the whim of the Governments acting either together or unilaterally.While all the political parties in Ireland and the Irish people were kept in the dark the Government entered secret consultations with the British Government. The result of those consultations was the scrap of paper issued on Monday, 19 April, as a Joint Declaration by the British and Irish Governments. Once again we are expected to accept it like tablets of stone carrying the definitive legal interpretation of this amendment.On behalf of Sinn Féin, let me state we do not accept it. It is not a legal interpretation; it is a political fig-leaf. The full legal and constitutional implications for the Good Friday Agreement are only now being explored in the two legal jurisdictions North and South. This affects both the Constitution and the Good Friday Agreement and it is an insult to expect us to swallow whole the so-called legal interpretation contained in the Government's Joint Declaration. When the people voted for the Good Friday Agreement in this jurisdiction, they did it by way of endorsement of constitutional change. The amended Article 2 enshrined the right to citizenship by birth. That is how it has been interpreted by the courts, reaffirmed as recently as the Supreme Court decision of January 2003. The two Governments' Joint Declaration of 19 April purports to reinterpret Article 2, as endorsed by the people and as contained in the Good Friday Agreement. People in the Six Counties will have no input into how the citizenship which they enjoy is determined by law for others in the future, if this constitutional amendment is passed. The British and Irish Governments are un-picking and undermining the Good Friday Agreement. Coming on top of the British Government's repeated assaults on the integrity of the Agreement, this is totally unacceptable and an indictment of the Irish Government's current handling of the peace process overall.This is no surprise as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is presenting the Bill, opposed the peace process at its inception and was a late convert, and has repeatedly shown his disregard for the basic principles underlying the Agreement, real inclusivity and respect for the democratic mandate and right of all elected voices.This Bill should go no further and if it is passed by the Oireachtas, I urge the people to reject it at the polls. They have a priceless instrument enshrined in the Constitution and no Government should be entrusted with determining who is entitled to citizenship on the island of Ireland. It is the people who should remain sovereign.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	389	The structure of the proceedings in the Dáil today and tomorrow shows the utter contempt of the Government in the manner it treats this Parliament. The Taoiseach is not present and cannot be questioned. The possibility of raising private notice, oral or written questions has been ruled out by order of the Government and the sheep behind it who voted for it. The critical issues that need to be brought to the attention of the Irish people and on which the Government should be questioned are Northern Ireland and the gutless and breathtaking obsequious response by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the US President's decision to legitimise Israeli terror and the theft of the land of the Palestinian people. It is a full five weeks since the Taoiseach met President Bush in the White House and we have not yet been able to question him on the justification the President gave him for his lies about weapons of mass destruction and invading Iraq, or an explanation for the disaster that ensued.The referendum to restrict the citizenship rights of children born in this State is irredeemably compromised and discredited from the beginning by the utter dishonesty of the proposing Minister and the motivation behind it. Deputy McDowell began his campaign by claiming a crisis in the maternity hospitals, in other words beginning the campaign with the worst kind of scaremongering and the figures he gave today are equally unrevealing, for example there is no breakdown of the figure of 5,000 or so non-EU nationals who gave birth last year and their reasons for being in Ireland. Look at the meanness of the Government. Thousands of women who are non- nationals staff our hospitals, as doctors, nurses and nurses' aids, keeping them from collapse. Furthermore industry, from the hospitality sector to others, depends on the labours of non-national women who pay their taxes and contribute to the country. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform states the country needs the fruits of their labour and their taxes but woe betide them if they go into labour because their children are an inconvenience to the State and will be cast out.The Minister referred to the pressure on the services in the maternity hospitals. I accept there is pressure, but what is the reason for it? In the 1950s and 1960s, 60,000 live births a year were recorded in the State. By the cash strapped 1980s the birth rate had risen to 72,000 live births a year, but in the early 2000s it dropped to 54,000 live births. Where are the difficulties? The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government ripped out 3,000 beds in the 1980s, with the closure of maternity hospitals. The reality is that any old reason will suffice to get the referendum show on the road because this debate has nothing to do with issue and everything to do with the base calculation by the Government. This completes the hat trick — rural housing and decentralisation of public services were the issues for the rural areas and immigration is the issue in urban areas which the Government believes will save the skins of its desperate candidates.The Government believes it can cynically manipulate the Irish people by raising half truths and fears on immigration into getting the people to vote "Yes". The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform know that candidates from their parties will stride around housing estates and streets whispering behind their hands that the reason for the housing and hospital crises is not the disastrous policies of this Government but immigrants. The Minister's hypocritically reasonable tone is a cover for the bigots in the Government parties and those outside, happily a minority. It is a cynical diversion from the real crises and problems.However, I have absolute confidence in the majority of the Irish people. They may or may not vote in favour of the referendum, and I urge them not to do so, but even if they do, they will not, like sheep, vote for Government candidates. I believe a large majority will vote in the European and local elections to punish this Government for its treachery and particularly for believing that it could cynically manipulate the people into voting for a cynical clutch of desperate politicians by virtue of putting this referendum before them.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I am grateful for the opportunity of speaking on this Bill. Before dealing with the detail of the proposal, I wish to put on record my anger and disappointment at the delay in enacting another important measure, the disabilities Bill. Despite this Government being in office for two years, the disabilities Bill has not yet come before the House even though it also deals with the rights of citizens with disabilities. However, they must wait indefinitely. It is a disgrace and simply not good enough.This debate should be about the integrity of Irish citizenship law. Sadly, it is not. It should be about the rights of children. Sadly, it is not. Ten or 15 years ago the country was torn apart by the abortion referendum debate. Now, we are creating a situation in which we will not grant rights to children. We should examine ourselves, open our minds a little further and see what is happening in society. A referendum can be proposed and held in less than 60 days, yet no disabilities Bill can be introduced for the 2,826 citizens in residential, day and respite care who have intellectual disabilities. It is hypocrisy and a shame. A Green Paper is required on this issue, as is debate and discussion.Why is immigration always presented in a negative way in our society? We need to look at the positive side of immigration. We must study the real issues and consider the people concerned. Consider our history and look at our families whose members are in America, England and Australia. Look at the massive contribution they have made. We should cop onto ourselves — it is our turn to do something on this issue.I disagree with and condemn the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's reference to "citizenship tourism". I strongly support the parties to the Good Friday Agreement who have raised concerns about this issue. I share those concerns. It is also important to consider Article 2 of the Good Friday Agreement which provides that it is the entitlement and birthright of every person born on the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation. There is nothing wrong with that. I support that principle. I also strongly support the views of Bruce Morrison. This man looked after 48,000 Irish citizens in America. He worked hard with the Irish Government to get them their visas. It is refreshing that there are ten non-national candidates standing in the local elections, 50% of whom are Independents. I wish them well. I hope they top the polls in their constituencies and that they take on the candidates in Dublin North-West who are distributing racist leaflets.This issue relates to the rights of children and equality in society. The Minister says he is not encouraging racism but the reality on the ground contradicts that. I can give three brief examples. A couple of days ago an Irish citizen who is engaged to a non-national and wishes to bring that person to Ireland to meet his family contacted my office to ensure there would not be a scene at the airport. He is bringing his fiancée into the country. The second example occurred in my constituency ten days ago. When walking around I was abused by somebody for supporting immigrants. I was told they are "taking our jobs and houses". The third classic example occurred last Monday night. Two non-nationals approached me and thanked me for speaking out on their behalf. They feared the tone of the debate. That is the reality.A candidate in Dublin North-West is distributing leaflets which call us windy, pinko liberals on this issue and describe us as soft on immigration. I will challenge those people. That is how this debate should proceed. I urge people to examine the facts and the reality. Let us look at the myths. The most common one is that the country is flooded with asylum seekers. In fact, they represent a relatively small proportion of total inward migration. From 1995 to 2000, half of the new arrivals were returning Irish emigrants. A total of 50,000 work permits were issued last year compared to 7,900 asylum applications. The latter number would not even fill Tolka Park on a good night.Another myth is that asylum seekers get money for cars, mobile phones and drink. They receive full board accommodation while applications are processed. Otherwise, they receive the same social welfare entitlements available to Irish people. The third myth is that asylum seekers do not want to work or are here to steal our jobs. They are barred from working while their cases are examined. However, many do voluntary work in refugee projects. It has been asserted that many asylum seekers are bogus and have no right to be here. Some are found ineligible under the Geneva Convention but this ignores the fact that most are forced to leave their home countries because of dire economic, political and social circumstances.I urge the people of Ireland to reject this referendum and vote "No".
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I wish to share time with the Taoiseach. All states need effective laws to deal with the entry, residence and departure of non-nationals in the interests of the wellbeing of society. Governments must protect the borders of the state, its economy and public services as far as practicable. A government that does not do this would be behaving in a reckless and irresponsible manner.The Bill before the House is reasonable and balanced and is another policy initiative, following the introduction of a series of measures since 1997 to deal with the issue of immigration. The Government proposes to amend Article 9 of the Constitution to return to the Oireachtas the power to decide the citizenship entitlements of people born on the island of Ireland, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen. It also proposes to introduce the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2004 if the referendum is passed. This Bill has been published.The Bill will provide that in the case of a child born to non-nationals, at least one of the parents will have to have been resident in Ireland for three of the four years preceding the birth of the child before the child becomes entitled to Irish citizenship. Where either parent of a child born anywhere in Ireland is a UK national or long-term resident, the child will be entitled to Irish citizenship. I join the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in calling for a calm, measured and informed debate, both inside and outside this House. Everybody's view deserves to be listened to and treated with respect.The wider immigration question — issues regarding refugees, asylum seekers and non-nationals generally — is one of the most important questions this society has to deal with today. It is a matter of great concern in the community. When the history of this time is written, the decisive measures taken in this regard by this Minister and his predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, since 1997 will then be fully appreciated.The Opposition has stated that this referendum is being rushed and has been hastily planned. I cannot agree. If anything, the Government probably should have acted sooner on this matter. The programme for Government stated that the Government will keep under review the number of applications from non-nationals to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child and initiate all-party discussions on the issue of such constitutional or other measures which might be required. This referendum has been on the cards for some time and now is the time to proceed with it.The other argument put forward by the Opposition, that a referendum should not be held at the same time as the local and European elections, is also fallacious. Its argument is that we should not discuss a political issue, a matter connected with immigration, in the context of democratic elections involving candidates. Heaven forbid. This is simply turning democracy on its head. The Opposition, in pursuing this argument, underestimates public representatives who, by and large, are responsible people. It also underestimates the intelligence of Irish people.This referendum has been on the cards for some time now. The time has come to proceed with it.The other argument put forward by the Opposition — that a referendum should not be held at this time as the local and European elections are under way — is also fallacious. Its members contend that we should not discuss a political issue, a matter connected with immigration, in the context of democratic elections involving candidates — heaven forbid. This is simply turning democracy on its head. In pursuing this line the Opposition under estimates public representatives who, by and large, are responsible people, and they under estimate the intelligence of the people generally. I have a problem with the idea of an intellectually superior elite deciding what issues people can or cannot cope with, and I am uneasy with the notion that legislators know best. Immigration is a controversial issue, but matters arising from this can and should be put to the people for a decision. They will decide on it, in their wisdom, in due course. What could be more democratic than this? It is one man, one vote and everyone has his say.The immigration question is being discussed throughout the length and breadth of Ireland. It is only right that we should have a national debate on it in the context of this proposal. Anybody seeking to have a debate on this should not be labelled racist. As a people, we are mature enough to discuss such matters. I also belong to the old school of thought that public representatives should represent the views of their electorate. They should show leadership, but this should not negate their representative role. There is considerable support for this measure in the wider community and I believe it will be passed. I suspect the Opposition Members also believe this. This is despite the fact that this measure has been universally condemned in the liberal press. That says something about the nature of the print media here. However, that is an argument for another day. The timing of the proposed referendum is the right one. There will be a bigger turn-out and everyone will have his say.The idea of considering what people are saying on the ground was derided last night on "Tonight with Vincent Browne" when my colleague, Deputy Ardagh, had the audacity to put it forward. We all know what people say to us in our clinics. They relate anecdotal evidence of what is happening in our maternity hospitals. They say that non-nationals are taking our jobs and houses and so forth. Deputy Finian McGrath raised that issue in his contribution. I listen to what they have to say and I respond in a calm, objective way. Public representatives have made a major contribution towards combating racism and our role should not be under estimated by anyone.Those in the Opposition have said there has been no consultation on this proposal. That is simply not true. As the Tánaiste said, we cannot have endless consultation on this issue. Many years ago, as a city councillor, I learned that constantly calling for more consultation on an issue is a tactic used by those who are fundamentally opposed to a measure but know they do not have the numbers to support them. There is an element of that in this debate. It is also the case that Opposition members attack the Government on any issue they can find. The enactment of the Irish nationality and citizenship (amendment) Bill 2004 will allow for much more consultation and debate when the time comes. I welcome the joint declaration from the British and Irish Governments in which they state that this referendum has no implications for the British-Irish Agreement. From experience I know the British, in particular, would not make such a statement lightly.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has stated that this referendum must go ahead because of a crisis in our maternity hospitals caused by the arrival of pregnant non-nationals and asylum seekers. He has also stated that we need this referendum to protect the integrity of Irish citizenship law. He pointed out that Ireland has the most liberal citizenship regime in Europe. The Irish Times criticised him for putting forward two different views but both views are equally acceptable and justify the legislation. I fully support the Bill.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I am pleased to be here today to contribute to this important debate. There is apparent agreement that there is clear and systematic abuse of Ireland's constitutional right to citizenship. This is a problem. What we need to do, in a rational way, is to identify a solution to this problem. That is what this referendum is about.It is obvious that citizenship is a fundamental aspect of our political system. However, citizenship is not only concerned with rights. It is also about duties and responsibilities. It is about the relationship between the State and its citizens and the duties of citizens toward other citizens. Abuse can devalue our sense of citizenship and we need to prevent this.In approaching the solution to this problem the Government was particularly conscious that Article 2 of the Constitution had its origins in the British-Irish Agreement. We wished to maintain the integrity of the agreement in preparing a change to our Constitution. We do not wish to be in breach of the agreement, which imposed obligations on the two Governments. For this reason the Irish and British Governments, the parties to the British-Irish Agreement, have issued an interpretative declaration which is clear and unequivocal in its terms. It acknowledges that the two Governments have considered the current effects and consequences of Article 2 of the Constitution. It states that it was never the intention of either Government that persons born on the island of Ireland to parents who did not have, at the date of birth, a sufficient connection with the island of Ireland would be conferred with Irish citizenship.Both Governments accept that amending Article 9 is not a breach of the British-Irish Agreement. It is simply not tenable to argue that anyone wanted to see our citizenship laws being abused in a manner that is now all too frequent. The interpretative declaration is a legal document with a status in international law that copperfastens the integrity of the British-Irish Agreement and eliminates the suggestion that there is any breach of the agreement's provisions. That there is and will be no breach of the British-Irish Agreement is now beyond dispute.To clarify the confusing and confused public statements about this proposed referendum I will set out what will be the constitutional and legal position on citizenship should the amendment be passed by the people. Article 2 and the new Article 9, combined with the enactment of the draft legislation, will have the following effects. A child born on the island of Ireland at least one of whose parents is an Irish citizen or entitled to Irish citizenship will continue to enjoy, by virtue of Article 2 of the Constitution, a constitutional right to Irish citizenship. Thus, a child born in Belfast to parents at least one of whom is an Irish citizen or entitled to Irish citizenship continues to have a constitutional right to Irish citizenship. A child born on the island of Ireland at least one of whose parents is a British citizen will be entitled to Irish citizenship. This right will derive from statute. The obligation to grant citizenship to this category of persons when born in Northern Ireland is provided for in Article 1(vi) of the British-Irish Agreement and Annex 2 to that agreement.A child born on the island of Ireland at least one of whose parents is entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on his or her period of residence will be entitled to Irish citizenship. This right will derive from statute. The obligation to grant citizenship to this category of persons when born in Northern Ireland is provided for in Article 1(vi) of the British-Irish Agreement and Annex 2 to that agreement. Article 1(vi) of and Annex 2 to the British-Irish Agreement are thus being complied with. A child born on the island of Ireland at least one of whose parents is entitled to reside in the State without any restriction on his or her period of residence will be entitled to Irish citizenship. This right will derive from statute. A child born on the island of Ireland at least one of whose parents has been lawfully resident on the island of Ireland for not less than three out of the four years immediately preceding the child's birth will be entitled to Irish citizenship, except where the parent was during that period residing in the island of Ireland pending the outcome of an application for refugee status or pursuant to a permission to reside for educational purposes. This right will derive from statute.Through the referendum we will confer on the Oireachtas the power to legislate for the conditions for granting citizenship to children of non-nationals. We will not be unique in this respect. All other member states of the European Union provide for the acquisition of citizenship through legislation or regulation. None of those member states has a constitutional right to citizenship by virtue of birth in its territory. Notwithstanding that, even after the proposed amendment is passed we will still provide for the right to citizenship for certain categories of persons in our Constitution. However, the right to acquire Irish citizenship for persons born in Ireland who do not have at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to become an Irish citizen will now be regulated by statute.We also need to protect our laws from being used to abuse European citizenship. We know from the Chen case currently before the European Court of Justice that the acquisition of Irish citizenship by children of non-nationals — with no sufficient connection to Ireland — has implications for other member states. That case concerns the birth in Belfast of a child to a Chinese woman who is claiming a right to reside in Britain by virtue of the Irish citizenship of her child. It is common ground in that case that the reason Ms Chen went to Belfast was to ensure her child, when born, would acquire Irish nationality, thereby enabling her mother to raise a possible claim to remain in the United Kingdom. This situation illustrates an unacceptable consequence of Article 2 of the Constitution. This abuse is not what the Governments and the Irish people expected would occur, but it has occurred and we need to take corrective measures. Hence the proposed referendum.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I am aware of recent criticism about this proposed referendum and the related legislative proposal. However, opponents of this change have failed to recognise the views of the Constitution Review Group. In its report of May 1996 the Constitution Review Group addressed the issue of citizenship and made a recommendation that the acquisition of Irish citizenship should not be provided for by the Constitution but on the contrary should be set forth in legislation. The justification for this proposal was simply stated. The imposition of conditions and qualifications on the grant of Irish citizenship is more appropriately a matter for legislation. I agree with the eminent group chaired by Dr. T. K. Whitaker which prepared this report, but my agreement is qualified by the desire to ensure that for children born on the island of Ireland whose parents are Irish citizens or entitled to become Irish citizens, the right to Irish citizenship remains enshrined in the Constitution.The rights of children of non-nationals to Irish citizenship will, as a result of this proposed amendment to Article 9, be provided for in legislation, but at the same time those born to Irish citizens or to those entitled to Irish citizenship will continue to have a constitutional right to Irish citizenship. This cannot be repeated often enough. The birthright to citizenship for these persons, which includes those born in Northern Ireland, is being maintained. The rights of the people of Northern Ireland as defined in annexe 2 of the British-Irish Agreement are also protected. Article 2 remains in our Constitution. It is not being deleted.We all want to have an enlightened debate about these proposed changes. Misrepresentation of the consequences of the proposed amendment serves only to obscure the real issue — that is to take appropriate and proportionate measures to end the abuse of our citizenship laws. We need a solution and the Government has proposed one. The Opposition has criticised the process of consultation but, so far, not the principle of preventing abuse of our rights to citizenship. If it is agreed that there is a problem then surely we must recognise the need for a solution. The status quo is not acceptable.The issue at the heart of the referendum is clear and simple. It is about stopping abuse of our Constitution. It also involves recognition that citizenship is about obligations as well as rights. It is about stopping the exploitation of our Constitution to exploit European citizenship. The Irish people understand what we are about. They know and appreciate that the choice is an obvious one. We can either do something or do nothing, and the latter is not an acceptable option. The former is the course we are pursuing. The Government will not abdicate its responsibility to promote a measure to solve a widely recognised and acknowledged problem. We need to protect our Constitution and our citizenship laws from abuse.Through the procedure of the referendum the Irish people are being given the right to decide, as the final arbiters of national policy, whether they wish the current situation to continue or not. The period between now and 11 June will provide ample time for debate, reflection and consideration by the people. To those who object to the referendum taking place on 11 June I say this: on the basis that there is a problem that needs to be solved, why should we delay its solution? For how long are we to delay consulting with the Irish people in order to allow them to decide on this issue? The presidential election would be an utterly unsuitable occasion for this referendum for reasons that are obvious to everyone.

The choice of 11 June is thus both reasonable and fair.Our decision to hold this referendum occurred against a background of looking at other possible solutions and for some time we have examined potential legislative solutions but none of those was compatible with the Constitution. We also sought to clarify the law before the Supreme Court in the L and O case and anticipated that this might have mitigated the problem, but this turned out not to be the case. A different problem developed with non-nationals coming to Ireland for the purposes of the birth of a child and the acquisition of citizenship and then leaving the country. This is not a phenomenon we are obliged to tolerate any longer. While immigration was a known fact at the time of the conclusion of the British-Irish Agreement, the substance and degree of the abuse of our Constitution requires us now to act to resolve this situation. After proper reflection on our position the clear and only option open to us was to propose an amendment to the Constitution, and this we have now done.The origin of the problem is constitutional in nature and hence a referendum is an essential and unavoidable part of that solution. Delay in holding the referendum would merely extend the opportunity for further abuse of our laws on citizenship and that is not acceptable. There can be no greater illustration of our democracy than to consult the Irish people and that is the inherently democratic exercise in which we are now engaged. How can anyone fear expression of the will of the Irish people?Finally, the allegation that this is a racist referendum is deeply offensive and a slur on the Irish people. It is an insult to the intelligence of our electorate and it is the ultimate act of cynicism. I can think of nothing more cynical than to oppose this referendum, knowing there is a problem to be solved. Those who have predicted a racist dimension to the referendum should now reflect on the wisdom of their allegations and address the proposed change on its merits and not on the basis of soundbites and slurs. In everyone's interest they ought to avoid creating a self-fulfilling prophecy by their language. It is not the Government but others who have brought the issue of race into this debate. We have proposed new citizenship laws which will continue to grant citizenship regardless of race. The race card should not be played by either side.I commend this proposed referendum to the House and to the people.

It is a pity we are not sitting today in a regular manner with the Order of Business, Question Time and Adjournment debate. I do not accept that we cannot receive answers to at least written questions from Ministers when the House is sitting. I have no difficulty with the concept of discussing this issue but I have a difficulty with the method by which we have come to debate this and with the railroading of this issue through to a referendum.Amending the Constitution is a very significant and serious step. It is not one to be taken lightly and should not be taken without a clear need to do so being shown. Up to now the Government has failed to show that need, yet it thinks it is in order to proceed with these changes. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government have to a large extent hailed the phenomenon of the rise in non-national women having babies in Ireland as the reason for this referendum. It seemed that the potential crisis in waiting in our maternity hospitals is the main reason behind this proposed referendum. If so it is the quickest reaction to a problem facing the health service that I have ever seen.Being the only EU country that operates in this way, granting citizenship based on birth, is at least a more significant and probably more honest reason for the referendum, but it is a great pity this perspective could not have been articulated from the beginning. It is also a pity and a shame that the masters of the Dublin maternity hospitals had to be dragged into this issue in a manner which they clearly never intended.The method and manner in which the Government has approached this referendum has been cynical to say the least and is clearly based on trying desperately to seek advantage in the June elections. Fine Gael has always stated that we need to seek a resolution to the issues and we want to contribute to finding that resolution. However, the Government has made no attempt to facilitate that or to facilitate discussion on the issue. The fact that the Government has yet to answer Deputy Gay Mitchell's various Dáil questions clearly shows its hypocrisy when saying it wants this issue to be non-political. The fact that the Government responded to Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's questions at the 11th hour leads me to the same conclusion. There is little point in even raising these matters but they need to be raised. The way Dáil questions are being treated by several Ministers shows little regard for democracy or for the House. I am still waiting for responses to questions I put down for the Minister for Education and Science some weeks ago on curriculum support units and inservice training for teachers. One would imagine this type of basic information would be readily available in any well organised and ordered Department, but clearly this is not so. This is unacceptable in every case but when the issue being considered is held up as the basis for holding a referendum to change our Constitution, and we cannot get basic information, then it is a disgrace.There are only two possible conclusions we can draw from this. First, the information is not available. If that is the case, what has the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform been talking about? If it is available why has he not complied with his duty to this House and released it in response to Deputy Mitchell's question?I accept that information on this matter was given last night to Fine Gael in two tranches. I am interested to know whether this information was made available to the Minister before or after he made his various pronouncements. There has been no real, meaningful consultation on this issue. Deputy Haughey said he does not want endless consultation, and I agree with him, but there should at least be some proper consultation. It is quite clear the Minister is making this up as he goes along. In March, he based much if not all of his reasoning for this referendum on the situation in the maternity hospitals. On 8 April, he said the real issue was "the integrity of Irish citizenship laws". One can only wonder what May will bring. The briefing document of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, published in March, also relied solely on the first reason.It also appears quite clear that there has been no meaningful discussion with the parties in Northern Ireland on this issue either. We cannot just wave away any possible consequences for the Good Friday Agreement as easily as the Government is attempting to do. While it is clear that the amendment is to Article 9 of the Constitution, what is less clear is the possible effect this will have on Article 2 as agreed by the people of Ireland in the 19th amendment to the Constitution, almost six years to the date from that which the Minister is proposing. Given that they agreed "It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation," I find it hard to believe that no one foresaw this problem, which the Government, all of a sudden, deems to be potentially catastrophic. Did the Government have no advice on this issue at the time? That is a legitimate question it must answer.All parties in the North have raised questions and fears, which must be properly responded to and debated. A joint declaration, now called an interpretative declaration, involving the Prime Minister is just that. That the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach both say it is so does not make it so, and they must prove it is so. The exclusion in Annex 2 of the Agreement is not in the Constitution or in Irish law. We are being asked to accept a great deal on the good faith of promised legislation.

The proposed amendment to Article 9, by starting with the phrase "notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution," effectively means Article 9 takes precedence over Article 2. The Taoiseach has argued it is simply not tenable to argue that anyone wanted to see our citizenship laws being abused in a manner that is now all too frequent. I do not believe anybody has articulated that case and this party has certainly not done so. The Taoiseach, when citing the Chen case, should clearly accept that it is before the court and that no decision has been reached on it as yet.For some years it has been very clear that this Government has no clear or coherent policy on immigration. This Bill is its one and only solution or policy proposal in this wide-ranging area. It is nearly impossible to obtain clarity on the entitlements of people regarding whether they can stay here or whether they are to be deported, on who can work and on who can stay to study. Some have clearly been abused and exploited as employees and others seem to be working illegally. Others want to work and cannot do so. However, there seems to be no real policy on any of these issues. Again, it is being made up as we go along by reacting to circumstances as the political climate dictates. We are being asked to accept a great deal on good faith.The Minister states in his proposal document that he is committed to the basic principles of the draft Bill. He may well be, but it deals with only the issue of citizenship, which I accept is as it should be in terms of the referendum. However, the Irish people are at the very least entitled to a real and proper immigration policy from the Government rather than a policy of dealing with the issue of citizenship alone. If the Government does not provide such a policy, it is allowing the scare-mongering, the rumour mill and the anecdotal stories to rule the day and to prejudice the opinions of many people.I disagree with the Minister on the issue of referring this matter to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I echo the comments of my party leader Deputy Kenny who stated that this is the best solution for calm and rational debate. We have made rushed amendments to our Constitution before, leading to years of controversy before change was made again. The sixth progress report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution recommended calm and measured debate on contentious issues. From what we have seen so far and from what we have heard this morning, this advice should be heeded.It is wrong to rush through this referendum on 11 June. The Tánaiste's selective quoting of timescales for other referenda is not relevant. The negotiations surrounding the Good Friday Agreement were given unprecedented coverage in the media, giving people masses of information on the issues involved. In any event, practically all parties were in support of it. The two divorce referendums were very much a matter of personal choice on an issue which had the potential to affect us personally. This issue will not just affect us personally but will affect others as well. We are making a serious decision to amend the Constitution in a very rushed manner, denying children the right of citizenship in the country of their birth. I accept that the rights and responsibilities of citizenship are more complex than just being a matter of birth. I include some of the issues the Minister raised today in that context, but it is these issues we need to discuss rationally.Rushing ahead with this referendum on 11 June is pointless. The comments on the Presidency do the Government and particularly the potential candidates no service. Do the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste really believe that if they hold this referendum on the date of a presidential election it will be divisive and that holding it on the date of the local and European elections will not? I do not know how many candidates will be running for President — last time out there were five — but I know I will leave it to the people to decide their worth. I do not see a problem for presidential candidates on this issue. They can legitimately refuse to discuss something, the legislation regarding which they may ultimately have to sign into law or refer to the Supreme Court.When it comes to the actions of thousands of candidates around the country, from all parties and none, I do not know how those opposite can be so naive and ignorant. Are they that far out of touch with reality? Do they not remember the lessons we should have learned from the last general election? I hope the abolition of the dual mandate will remove some of the worst offenders from the electoral process this time out. The comment by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that "if you are racist vote "no" in this referendum, because there is nothing racist about this proposal." makes absolutely no sense. Despite this, it is a cheap shot that will only fuel bitterness and divisiveness in this debate. The Minister has done nothing to prevent this, he has poured petrol on its potential to ignite and he should be ashamed of it.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	403	My party has already stated it will not be found wanting in finding a solution to what we accept is a potential problem with our Constitution. However, we question the timing and method of finding that solution. I am utterly convinced that every State has the right to protect and secure the integrity of its borders and its citizenship rights. If those borders and citizenship rights are no longer legally secure, for whatever reason, and if this insecurity or vulnerability has implications for other countries, we do not just have a right but an obligation to take whatever steps are necessary to regain control and determine precisely how the very considerable privilege of citizenship is to be attained.Why are we dealing with this Bill now? What is the rush? I recall emergency legislation that was promised in the context of the need to finish the motorway in my constituency. It was promised almost three months ago and it pertains to a real emergency and a job that cannot be completed because of the absence of such legislation, yet this Bill can come from nowhere almost overnight. Why are we dealing with it now? There are so many other immigration issues that have not been resolved. Why do we force economic migrants into the soul-destroying and absolutely demoralising asylum seeking process? After forcing them into this process, they are not allowed work and when they do not work we call them wasters. Why not take time and proceed in a way that will build consensus? I heard the Tánaiste state it is difficult to achieve complete agreement. It is, but a majority recognises there is a problem and would be constructive in helping to solve it.I have no doubt that our acceptance that there is a problem is viewed by some as racist. Worse, I believe the issue will be used by real racists to reinforce their existing prejudices and to air them with impunity over the coming months. Worse again, the Government knew this. At some level — although the Government denies it — this is part of the reason this referendum is being proposed at this time. The Minister has shown that he knows exactly the potential electoral advantage of creating a bogeyman for the public to fear and offering oneself as its saviour.The arguments regarding the need to deal with the problem which has arisen as a result of the Good Friday Agreement are compelling and stand in their own right without any need to resort to the kind of unsubstantiated old guff which, unfortunately, we frequently hear about racism nowadays. We may think we have heard a lot of guff recently but when we get into the campaign for the local and European elections, every other issue will be forgotten in a frenzy of racist accusations and counter accusations — these may be made privately on doorsteps but they will be made. We have managed to keep a lid on this problem for some time but once we cross the Rubicon of raw, open and vicious racism, there is no undoing the damage and no turning back. Once we have debate openly acknowledging real naked racial hatred, the situation will be irretrievable and there will be no turning back. On its own, this is the most compelling reason not to hold the referendum in the pressure cooker context of a political election where individual candidates have so much of their personal reputation and future at stake that, as anyone who has ever been a candidate knows, reason and moderation go out the window. Here we have a perfect topic for them.The second reason for waiting is that if we rush at this change, there is every danger that we will get it wrong. We made a constitutional mistake, have known that for six years and have seen its impact over a number of years. Up to three weeks ago there was no rush to do anything to close this particular loophole. However, suddenly in the space of three short weeks it has become a crisis with which we must deal immediately. In those three weeks we have recalled the Dáil, the referendum Bill has been published, draft legislation has been published and we must get it through as quickly as possible so that it can be put to the people in six weeks time. Why is this? I do not understand the reason for the speed. How can the Government blame us for thinking that this is all about gaining some kind of electoral advantage?The reality is that if we get this wrong — and many people have mentioned the dangers of getting it wrong — there will be no electoral advantage for anybody. We will get it wrong if we rush at it. We all know the potential pitfalls of messing about with our Constitution, even when we give it all the thought and time in the world. Most of us accept that we have left an unintended loophole in the Constitution. If we are lucky, we will probably get one shot at fixing it. We do not always get even that one shot. I dread mentioning the infamous abortion referenda fiascos. We got it wrong that time and the situation was irretrievable; we could never get it right afterwards. There is every danger that we will do the same again. Nobody was happy after several attempts to change the Constitution regarding abortion and there is every possibility that on a controversial issue such as this, the same will happen.I urge the Minister to proceed slowly with caution and to try to build consensus. He should refer this issue to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and let us as dispassionately as possible look at all the angles and options and return to the issue in the autumn. The issue should not be postponed indefinitely but we should return to it in the autumn with clear heads and the clearer views we all tend to have after an election.As health spokesperson for my party I wish to refer to the maternity hospital issue and to the suggestion that this referendum is the result of a request from the masters of the maternity hospitals——

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I accept that may be the case. However, the masters have a genuine concern. As spokesperson on health, I hear more than most of the undoubted difficulties our maternity hospitals experience. I have heard of the difficulties future mothers have in booking a place in hospitals, of the overcrowding when they get a place, of women being turfed out 24 hours after giving birth, of the strain on staff in dealing with the different cultural practices of non-national mothers and their families, of infection risks and the dangers of mothers presenting in the last stages of pregnancy — often straight from the airport. Nobody disputes the existence of additional pressures on the hospitals as a result of the increased number of births, some of which are non-national births.Pressures and shortages exist across the health service and maternity hospitals are really not much different from the rest of the service. Demands have been made for information on the extent to which the problem of overcrowding in the hospitals and the increased number of births is due to the desire to claim citizenship. It is impossible to be precise about the figure. However, I feel this does not matter. The number of births is minuscule compared to the potential number of births. It is this principle we must address rather than suggest the difficulty in the maternity hospitals is the problem. There is a genuine practical problem which is surmountable. It can be solved with money, just like the other problems in the health service. However, the potential long-term problem is that we could become the maternity unit for the entire non-EU world. It is the scale of potential abuse which justifies the need for change in our Constitution rather than any of the surmountable practical problems we have seen so far which certainly do not require changes in the Constitution.I accept that we could have a major problem in the long term. If the problem is a long-term one we have time to deal with it. We should take the time to deal with it effectively and calmly. We will not have an unstoppable tide of pregnant women arriving between now and 11 June. I urge the Minister to take his time in proceeding with this. He must consider whether rushing into this and getting it wrong is worth the risk he is taking in ramming it through now against public will and against the will of many in the Dáil, especially when there is so much potential to build consensus on the issue.

The problem is that currently our laws allow people to use the system to gain citizenship. I do not believe that the problem is the abuse by others of our weaknesses. The problem is our weakness and this is something we must address.We are effectively debating citizenship today. We are debating the preciousness of citizenship and the value we put on it. Many contributors have pointed out that many rights and benefits are associated with citizenship. Citizenship also carries duties. The Minister referred to Article 9.2 which states: "Fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens." Fidelity is defined as loyalty and steadfastness and the nation is the people who live in a country. Loyalty also means feelings of allegiance. The State is the whole body of people in Ireland who are united with one Government. We may not all like the one Government which is in power at any point in time but we accept it and have a loyalty to it.The gift of citizenship should not be treated as a good or chattel which can be obtained by default and then used for the benefit of individuals in another ——

The problem is being addressed now. The gift of citizenship should not be treated as a chattel and then used for the benefit of individuals in another country. The privilege of citizenship in these circumstances is not appreciated. Irish people expect our citizens to appreciate the unique national sense of being an Irish citizen. At present there is an anomaly in the Constitution which gives citizenship to people who have little or no allegiance, not even through their parents, to the nation of Ireland.The Constitution allows for a person who is born on the island of Ireland, irrespective of any connection or allegiance to Ireland, to be a citizen of Ireland. This was brought about by the wording inserted into Article 2 of the Constitution to give effect to the terms of the Belfast Agreement. It was never intended in the drafting of the terms of the Agreement that this anomaly would be introduced. The Twenty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill changes neither the terms of the Belfast Agreement nor the constitutional changes adopted to give effect to the terms of the Belfast Agreement. The Minister went over this in detail in his speech but I also had a little piece prepared on it. As he stated, in Article 1(vi) of that Agreement the participants recognised "the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland." The Minister went into greater detail, stating that the people of Northern Ireland included the people who had allegiance to the country — Northern Ireland — where they actually live and were people who were born in Northern Ireland before the Belfast Agreement. The people of Northern Ireland, who identified themselves and were accepted as British or Irish, may choose to confirm that their right to hold British and Irish citizenship is accepted by both Governments and it would not be affected by any future change in the status of Northern Ireland. That, effectively, is why Article 2 was put into the Constitution. It was to give effect to that. In the Agreement itself, there was no question of recognising the birthright of all people who were born in Northern Ireland; it was "the people of Northern Ireland." This amendment to the Constitution in no way affects the Belfast Agreement in that regard.As a result of this anomaly people who do not have allegiance to the State through their parents' citizenship or continued legal residence are using this loophole in our laws to gain Irish citizenship by stealth. The intent behind this act is, in some cases, not to contribute to the nation of Ireland but to access residence in other EU countries. One might ask what is so wrong with that. There are many answers. If one goes around the houses knocking on the doors, one will not find the type of racial hatred that has been expressed from the benches opposite but genuine concern that there is a loophole.

There also does not appear to be any quid pro quo in the process of citizenship by birth and there is a feeling abroad that people are pulling the wool over the eyes of the nation.Irish citizenship is being used in an unintentional way which is embarrassing to the State. As other Members mentioned, there is the case of Ms Man Levette Chen and her daughter, Kunqian Catherine Zhu, who have appealed to the European Court of Justice a decision of the British Home Secretary that they do not have the right to reside in the UK. Ms Chen and her husband work for a Chinese company exporting goods to the EU. They came to the UK when she was approximately six months pregnant and acting on legal advice received from a lawyer in the UK, Ms Chen travelled to Belfast in July 2000, where she had her baby on 16 September 2000. I do not in any way want to cast aspersions on Ms Chen. The facts of the case are what I am highlighting. It is her legal team who suggested to her that she go to Ireland and have the child born there so the mother would be dependent on the child for immigration status.

Over the 18th century citizenship developed to include rights of individual freedom and of protection through the courts. In the 19th century citizenship came to include the right of political participation and was concerned with the extension of access to the parliamentary process. The republican movement developed throughout Europe in the late 18th century and early 19th century and the questions of democracy and how citizens controlled and directed their lives were important. In the 20th century citizenship came to include the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security and the right to a share in social heritage. This is the type of citizenship that applies in Ireland. In Ireland people are entitled to social welfare payments. When they grow old they are entitled to a decent old age pension. They are entitled to a medical card if their income is below a certain threshold. They are entitled to housing if they are on the housing list.

That is why citizenship of Ireland is so important and valuable.Then came the EU citizenship which derived from the Maastricht treaty in February 1992. As a result of that treaty, every person holding nationality of a member state is a citizen of the EU. In 1997, the Treaty of Amsterdam gave a further right to EU citizens to bring cases in the European Court of Justice against EU institutions. In the Ms Chen case, that is what is being used to fight the decision on residency in the UK. The case is now being fought in the European Court of Justice on grounds of the citizenship of the child Ms Chen had in Ireland. Ms Chen had every right to use all of the methods at her disposal and every non-national who comes here and becomes a citizen has the right to use every method at his or her disposal to ensure the maintenance of benefits accrued.Deputy Olivia Mitchell spoke of the problems in the maternity hospitals in Dublin. Since 2002, there have been many problems due to the number of non-nationals who have come to Dublin. As the Minister said, there were huge and unprecedented pressures. I spoke recently to a midwife in the Coombe hospital, where it is accepted that pressures exist. We have, however, a health service staffed by doctors and nurses who are equal to the task and can manage the situation despite the admittedly huge pressures. All credit is due to the doctors, midwives and nurses in our maternity hospitals for the great work they have done. These pressures should not continue. There are resources which could be used elsewhere if there were not such pressures on the maternity hospitals.When women arrive at hospitals in late stages of pregnancy, the first consideration for doctors and nurses is the health and welfare of the mothers and their children. The concern of the doctors and nurses is not about resources or cost, but about having in place the physical resources necessary to protect the health of the mothers and babies. There are problems for a non-national mother arriving during a late stage pregnancy in a maternity hospital in Dublin. No ante-natal history is available to the hospital. Normally, when a woman is pregnant, after a month, six weeks or two months she begins to attend the hospital. Blood groups are sorted out, any problems are taken care of and everything is put in place so that the birth can occur successfully. Everything is arranged so that problems which are foreseen can be dealt with. Some of the non-national women who arrive at hospitals in late pregnancy face danger. In a way, the legislation will be doing a service for these people. The Minister has spoken of "citizenship tourism" and has been castigated for using that term, but from the reports I have heard, having spoken to people in various countries, I know that people have planned to arrive in Ireland at the opportune time to have a child. The Irish people do not appreciate this. Loopholes allowing for such situations should be closed, and anomalies dealt with.The broad issue of immigration policy also arises. All right-thinking people in the Dáil and in Ireland would like to see a genuine immigration policy appropriate for people who wish to emigrate from countries poorer than Ireland and also for Ireland, which needs people to fill jobs. We do not have enough people to fill all the vacancies. Moreover, most people will accept that the added colour and cultures that have come to Ireland have enriched the country, making it a more cosmopolitan, interesting, exciting and pleasurable place in which to live.One of our immigrants, Benedicta Attoh, is to run in the local elections in Dundalk. Many of us saw her recently on television. Benedicta is a Nigerian mother of six, with a business in Dundalk, and as I said last night, after voting for my Fianna Fáil colleagues I intend to give her my next highest preference — notwithstanding the possibility of there being a Progressive Democrats candidate's name on the ticket.

I commend the Bill to the House.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The phrase "I am not a racist but..." is what I and everyone else in this House hear in our clinics and in our constituencies. By means of the amendment before us, the Government will fuel this attitude in the run-up to and during the local election campaign right up to polling day. That is the sad aspect of this issue. If the Government came to this House with a genuine proposal, we would wholeheartedly welcome it and would work with the Government to address the matter, but it is purely for electoral purposes that this legislation is being brought forward. It will fuel the bigotry of the people who say "I am not a racist but...".There is a great deal of public confusion. Anyone with a skin pigment different from our own is automatically assumed to be an asylum seeker. When the issue arises on people's doorsteps, I spend a great deal of time explaining that there is an array of different individuals in this country, not all of whom are asylum seekers. Everyone would agree that Paul McGrath is Irish. There are non-nationals in this country married to Irish people. There are EU nationals in this country who have a right to be here, just as Irish citizens have the right to go to any other part of the European Union. There are migrants in Ireland with work permits. For example, 12.5% of the population of the town of Roscommon is made up of Brazilians, whose first language is Portuguese. There are Bosnian refugees in Ireland. Before them there were Vietnamese refugees who came to this country 20 or 30 years ago and comprise a very small percentage of the population. We then have two types of asylum seekers. Some come to Ireland because of genuine threats to their lives. Others are economic migrants seeking asylum, who hope to have their applications approved so that they can live and work in this country just as the Irish did in many parts of the world.It should be acknowledged that there is a significant number of people among the latter group who are well educated and cannot work in this country. Will the Minister explain why they cannot do so? We have doctors, engineers and every type of specialist in centres across the country who, legally, are not allowed to work. Much of the bigotry could be addressed if those people had the right to work. There are even people in Ireland who are married to Irish nationals but do not have the right to work; they have to apply for work permits. Employers are not very eager to go through the work permit system.Fine Gael acknowledges that Article 2 of the Constitution, as inserted following the Good Friday Agreement, creates the potential for abuse of Irish citizenship. As my party leader stated earlier, Fine Gael shares the objective of closing off that potential abuse and it is committed at all times to working constructively with the Government and all other parties to finding the best solution to that problem. However, shoving something through at the last minute is not the best way to do that. I listened to my Dáil colleague Deputy Ardagh and I thought I was listening to "Bull Island". He spoke about the privilege of Irish citizenship and the fact that some people have no allegiance or connection to the State. I presume many of the Fianna Fáil members that are here today are speaking with a "tongue in cheek" approach, in light of all the passports divvied out over the years by Fianna Fáil-led governments. Some of them have brought economic benefits to the Minister's county as he well knows. The reality is that all of a sudden we have this huge respect for Irish citizenship which was not there in the 1980s or 1990s. It seems hypocritical that Members in this House talk about the privilege of Irish citizenship.No one from the Government has given an answer on this problem. Why do we not have any details on the numbers of people coming here, or the number of people that will be affected by this legislation? Why has no research been carried out? This Government has brought in consultant after consultant over the past seven years. There have been enough reports from experts in every area to fill this Chamber. Whenever the Government has been in difficulty, it immediately calls in the experts to produce reports. Why not produce a report on this issue? The Government gave a commitment in the programme for government that it would look at the issue. Why did it not do so over the intervening two years? Is this is a real problem, or a potential problem? No one seems to be able to answer that today. Deputy Ardagh alleged that people were being advised in the UK to come to Ireland to obtain citizenship of the EU. That is incorrect. It was the case a few years ago that people were coming here from the UK to have children, but that is not currently happening. This is because people are now able to get direct flights to Dublin so they do not need to stop over in the UK first. There is no research into the extent of the problem.What happens if this constitutional amendment does not address the problem? We will still have the same number of people coming in, whatever number that is. What do we do then? If citizenship is not the reason people are coming, then what happens? I do not believe the sole reason for someone who flies in from Lagos to have a child here is that the child can have Irish citizenship in 18 years' time. No one has yet provided the information to contradict me.Why has this amendment not been referred to the Oireachtas committee on the Constitution? There have been suggestions that there are other options. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe will propose a number of other options that should be considered and that could resolve the issue. If his solution does not address the problem, it is flexible so that we can come back and review it. We do not have that flexibility in a constitutional amendment. Why are these suggestions not being considered? Why are we not getting the opportunity to consider them at an all-party committee on the Constitution? Why will we not have the legislation prior to the referendum? The people are being asked to trust the Government that promised 2,000 extra gardaí two years ago, none of whom we have seen. We are being asked to trust the Government that promised the abolition of waiting lists in our hospitals by April 2004, which has not happened. Does anyone seriously believe we can trust this Government? I would not trust it as far as I could throw it, and this is not too far.What guarantees do we have that we do not end up in the same situation as we were in the 1980s on abortion? The referendum that was passed provided for the one thing that it was supposed to prohibit. We could end up in a similar legal quagmire. Therefore, why can we not let a committee look at it? The Tánaiste spoke about the consultation that took place with the parties on this side of the House. We know that no consultation has taken place and that the Minister has buried his head in the sand. Consultation for five minutes over the coffee table is the sum total of the consultation that took place.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	428	There is also the issue of the implications for the Good Friday Agreement, with which the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, was involved at the time. Why was there no discussion with the parties in Northern Ireland on the issue? It defies logic that the Government was prepared to discuss the issue in a hurry with the British Government, but was not prepared to discuss the issue with the parties in Northern Ireland. This must cause concern to Fianna Fáil, the republican party that professes to be an all-Ireland party. It was not prepared to talk to its colleagues north of the Border. It is hypocritical and adds to the suspicions of the true intentions of this Government on the referendum. This represents the typical twisting and turning by the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and the Taoiseach.If one actually talks to the staff in the Dublin maternity hospitals, rather than inviting them in and spinning what happened afterwards as the Minister did, one would find that many of the non-nationals coming here are actually quite wealthy. When asked why they come to Dublin, they cite the quality of our maternity service as the reason. That will not be addressed by this referendum. No one on the other side of the chamber had the gumption to carry out a survey. The vast majority of those people have never attended an ante-natal clinic and many have major complications. If they are coming here because of the health service it seems sensible that the reason is so that they can have a smooth delivery. That puts huge additional demands on our health services. That problem will not be addressed by this Bill.Take the case of a woman in her 41st week of pregnancy. She arrives at Dublin Airport from Lagos via France, with her two children, a 16-month old boy and a two and a half year old boy. Why did she come here? She is a well-educated wealthy woman. The reason is the health service, as she told staff in one of the Dublin maternity hospitals. Many of them finish up in the UK afterwards, not in Ireland.In such cases the children must be made wards of court while the mother is in the maternity hospital. The vast majority of such women coming here are 38 to 40 weeks pregnant. Hospital staff are being told the reason they leave it so late before coming is that they will be moved to other parts of the country if they arrive earlier. They do not want this because they believe the quality of service available in Dublin is second to none. Many Irish women travel to Dublin to have their babies.Why are the airlines carrying these people into this country? Many Irish women are refused permission to travel by airlines even though their term of pregnancy is relatively short, and despite having doctors' letters certifying they can travel. Yet the airlines have no difficulty in bringing people half way around the world and dumping them here in Ireland. Why has the penny never dropped for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, who is jumping like a butterfly all over the place about bus deregulation, penalty points etc? The Minister, who could fill this room with all his press statements, has never commented on this issue. It just shows how incompetent this Government is and why we cannot address simple problems. The only explanation for this being discussed in the House today is politicking, not a serious attempt to address the specific issue.On 30 September last I tabled a question in the House asking the Minister for Health and Children to indicate the sums of money sought by each health board to deal with the issue of asylum seekers and the additional demand they were putting on the health services. I asked how much of that money was actually furnished to the health boards. The reply is not one cent so it is a big issue with the Government and has been for the last two years. The Tánaiste said the Government had been examining this matter, yet it is not worth one cent so far as the health services are concerned. Enormous additional demands are being placed on the health services as regards maternity, blood screening, respiratory services etc. These services are being demanded and are required by asylum seekers, not necessarily people who come into this country at the last minute, but those who are resident here and who are applicants for asylum. Not one cent has been given by the Minister for Health and Children to the health boards to address this problem.Take the experience in two hospitals with which I am familiar. Some 11% of births in University College Hospital Galway are to asylum seekers. This legislation would do nothing to address that 11% birth rate because we do not have direct flights from any of these countries, be it France or Nigeria, into Galway airport. The same applies to Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe. There is no airport near that hospital. The problem will not be solved by this referendum. There are significant additional demands for maternity services. The Western Health Board has sought additional funding from the Department of Health and Children but has received nothing. The same health board has sought additional funds for the community and acute services because of the additional demands. It has received nothing under this heading either from the Department. None of these problems is going to be solved by this referendum.It is estimated that it costs approximately €13 million per annum to deal with the 22,500 asylum seekers in this country at present. This does not take tourists into account. The legislation before us will do absolutely nothing to address the situation.The reality is that this is another blind pulled by a pathetic Government over the chaotic health service that exists in this country. In the same way as the introduction of the smoking ban was intended to divert attention away from the crumbling state of our health services, the proposed referendum is to again hide the scandal that no funding has been provided to deal with the additional demands caused by asylum seekers.If the Government is genuine about achieving cross-party support, it should accept the amendment put forward by Members on this side of the House and refer the issue to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, with a mandate to report by 1 September, so that we may have a referendum before the end of the year.This debate is not evidence that the Government wants to address the problem. It is pure politicking. I was listening to the Tánaiste yesterday when she was being interviewed about the legislation being debated today. The Government has been aware of the problem for a considerable time. She said it had been included in An Agreed Programme for Government. If it has been such a burning priority for Government over the last two years, why has there been no consultation, either with the parties in this House or those north of the Border? Why has no additional funding been provided for the maternity hospitals in this State? Many of the maternity hospitals are being run on a shoestring at the moment due to the lack of resources and the additional demands they face from asylum seekers who are resident in Ireland, quite apart from the tourists who come here. Why has there been no action by the Minister for Transport? If there is a significant problem with women coming into this country who are 38 to 40 weeks pregnant, why have the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not mentioned it in this Chamber and sought to put regulations in place? The reason is that this is not a Government priority. It is just being used to deliver seats in the local elections. The Government parties know they will be annihilated if they do not bring forward this referendum.

There was no legislative framework to deal with the asylum issue in a modern setting. Indeed, the most recent legislation in that area dated back to the quaintly named Aliens Act 1935.

This included the Immigration Act 1999, which introduced provisions for the effective processing of applications for refugee status; the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, a new independent statutory agency to decide on asylum applications; the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, a second independent statutory agency to decide on asylum appeals; the Refugee Legal Service to ensure that independent legal advice was available to asylum seekers at all stages of the asylum process; the Reception and Integration Agency to co-ordinate the dispersal of asylum seekers throughout the country to ensure that they were provided with accommodation and services; significant additional staffing resources — the largest allocation of resources to any area of the Civil Service by the then Government — to ensure that all asylum applications were dealt with efficiently and effectively; the fingerprinting of asylum seekers to facilitate the detection of multiple applicants; and the effective application of the Dublin Convention.I also introduced a series of necessary measures to combat illegal immigration and to prevent abuse of the asylum procedure to circumvent legal immigration controls. These included the Immigration Act 1999 which put the State's procedures for deportations on a statutory basis for the first time ever and set out the rights of persons liable to be deported and the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 which provided for an unlimited fine or up to ten years' imprisonment or both for a person convicted on indictment of trafficking in persons. I introduced substantive changes in regard to the acquisition of Irish citizenship by non-nationals who marry Irish citizens in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2001 to restrict the scope for abuse in this area and provided for the forfeiture of the means of transport used for trafficking in illegal immigrants. I established the Garda National Immigration Bureau, led by a detective chief superintendent, to combat trafficking and to co-ordinate the effective implementation of deportation orders. I established a statutory scheme of judicial review in asylum and immigration cases to ensure that, after all due procedures have been gone through, the judicial process could not be used to frustrate a person's deportation where it had been held that there was no basis for the non-national's continued stay in the State and a draft scheme of the immigration (carriers liability) Bill which provides that an airline or ferry bringing a passenger to Ireland without adequate immigration documentation would be subject to financial penalty.I also established closer contacts at both strategic and operational level with the authorities in the UK and France and Garda liaison officers took up duty in London and Paris. I introduced readmission agreements with Romania, Bulgaria, Poland and Nigeria, a streamlined system to facilitate the lawful entry of persons into the jurisdiction in conjunction with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that labour shortages in the economy could be addressed through legal immigration to the State and a comprehensive modern code of immigration and residence law to provide for the implementation of fair and sensible immigration policies, while at the same time respecting the rights of non-nationals in their dealings with the law.During my term as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I was determined to ensure that immigrants, irrespective of their status or whether they happened to be here legally or illegally, had their human rights fully respected. Measures introduced included the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act, 2000 which are generally regarded as being the most comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation in the EU. The Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations, two independent statutory agencies, were set up to implement this legislation. There was ratification of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. We established the Human Rights Commission under the Human Rights Commission Act 2000 and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism to develop programmes and actions aimed at developing an integrated approach against racism.I am proud that between the years 1997 and 2002 I put in place a modern, up-to-date policy approach with a legislative framework consistent with best international practice and an innovative administrative structure with the necessary resources to ensure the efficient and effective discharge of policy in the asylum and immigration areas. I am pleased to note that this policy approach has been followed by my successor in office and that the legislative framework and administrative structure introduced by me have stood the test of time.Members opposite may wish to forget it now but all this was done in the face of trenchant and vociferous opposition from powerful forces inside this House and outside of it.

When I opposed calls for an amnesty because it would attract more asylum seekers in the expectation of more amnesties, I was roundly condemned. When I introduced fingerprinting to protect the integrity of asylum law, I was lampooned. When I legislated to close the door on marriages of convenience designed to secure citizenship, I was scorned. When I strenuously resisted extending the right to work to asylum seekers because it would become a pull factor for other asylum seekers, I was pilloried.

Let it not become the enemy again.In a fog of confusion the Opposition called for simplistic solutions and argued for an open door policy to give a general right of work to asylum seekers, and for an amnesty for asylum seekers irrespective of the validity of their claims. They argued against fingerprinting of asylum seekers; that employers of illegal immigrants should go unpunished; for a cessation of deportations; against measures to combat marriages of convenience which secured citizenship; against expediting judicial reviews even in manifestly unfounded cases; that economic disadvantage, of itself, should provide an automatic and unfettered right of passage across national boundaries; and for policy positions which were not followed by any other international state.

The Supreme Court decided that parents of an Irish child did not have an automatic right to stay but that the children had an automatic right of citizenship. No other country grants this facility. It is reasonable for the people to change the Constitution to provide that a child be an Irish citizen only if one or other of the parents has lawfully been here for a period of time. Last year, between 20% and 25% of births in Dublin's three maternity hospitals were to non-nationals. The number of non-nationals pregnant at the time of application was almost 60% of the number of female asylum seekers aged 16 years and over.Elections will be held on 11 June when the people will also make a decision on amending the Constitution to provide that the parent of a child born in Ireland be lawfully here for a period before being entitled to citizenship. Balanced immigration policy and laws are needed.

When they are consistently breached and abused, a fertile seed for racism is sown.Whether people like it or not, there has been a change in migration flows throughout the world. The whole question of immigration will become more of an issue in the coming years. No one should be under the illusion that this referendum will be a panacea, as it cannot resolve all of the problems regarding this issue. It must be remembered that hundreds of thousands of people are coming from other jurisdictions into the EU. Many of those people are facilitated by ruthless gangs. The consequences of these gangs' actions were seen in County Wexford some years ago. Admittedly, the majority of asylum seekers in the EU are at the coalface of human misfortune. However, there are no circumstances under which a country of this size can accommodate all those people coming into the EU or even a significant percentage thereof.There have been calls for simplistic solutions such as quotas. The truth is that the immigration and asylum procedures are governed by the Geneva Convention which demands that each country must, of necessity, examine each and every application for asylum. There is only room for clarity and not obfuscation on this issue. When I asked how one would get around this issue, no one could tell me how. There is no utopian solution to the immigration issue or any other issue. States must enact legislation to protect their borders and their social and economic fabrics. Every state is entitled to ensure that it protects the security of its people.

Considering his paltry track record for legislation as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, perhaps Deputy McDowell could have a word in the Minister's ear on the 40 Bills still waiting to be dealt with urgently.I was disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform supplied statistical information only to the Fine Gael Party spokesperson, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, and not to the other party spokespersons. He claims to have supplied it on request. However, at a consultative meeting with the Minister on 7 April, I understood that any available information would be shared with Opposition spokespersons as I had requested. It is also disappointing that an appendix should then appear in the Minister's Second Stage speech and in the media which was not circulated to the other spokespersons. However, it makes no difference as it contains irrelevant information with no breakdown of facts and figures. As the Minister said, it is little more than anecdotal information. When a Minister uses the term "anecdotal" to justify legislation, there is something wrong. However, when he uses it to justify a constitutional amendment, there is something seriously wrong.The Minister also said the possibility of an all-party agreement is nil and any attempt to seek it is futile. The Minister knows that is not true. When I met him on 7 April I proposed that there should be an all-party Oireachtas committee and that the Labour Party would accept the outcome of the deliberations of that committee so he is simply telling us an untruth here.If the Minister had established the correct procedure and allowed an all-party committee to be established perhaps we would not have a situation like the Mrs. Chen case to which the Taoiseach alluded in his speech when he talked about claims and appeals as a reason for constitutional change. Surely one awaits the outcome of matters of this nature and if the outcome is negative, that should be fed into the consultation process to become a factor in an argument on why we have to close a loophole. If the case fails there is no loophole. No one in the European Union has brought this to our attention as a loophole caused by our legislation. That there is a case before the European Court of Justice which has not been decided is another reason against jumping into a constitutional amendment now. We do not know what the outcome will be. If the outcome is negative why would we need a constitutional amendment? If it is positive the Government has an argument to bolster its case. Instead it is rushing this on, willy-nilly.The most disappointing aspect of the Minister's contribution was his bald statement "if you are racist vote "No" in this referendum". It is unworthy of anyone in this House, least of all the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to brand anyone who might oppose the amendment — that is the effect and there is no sense in Deputy O'Dea shaking his head at it. It brands the opposition to the amendment as racist. The Minister should not have put that into his speech and he should not have put it in upper case as he did. He said that the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution addresses a "fundamental issue". The Tánaiste said recently that everyone agrees there is a serious problem to be addressed. The Taoiseach said in the Dáil on 30 March that our citizenship laws are being "rampantly abused" and again in his contribution today he said "the substance and degree of the abuse of our Constitution requires us now to act to resolve this situation". That is erroneous because no figures have been given. The British and Irish joint declaration on Monday, 19 April stated that the amendment to Article 2 of the Constitution was not in accordance with the intention of the British-Irish Agreement of 1998. As a result the Government has decided to spring the amendment upon us and has done so out of the blue. It is strange that such a "fundamental issue" and the "rampant abuse" could have crept up on us so suddenly that we must reconvene the Dáil a week early and have an emergency debate this week.This Second Stage debate will be guillotined at 6.30 p.m. tomorrow and debate will be further guillotined on Committee and Report Stages. It will be similarly rushed through the Seanad in order to meet the minimum deadline to enable the vote to take place alongside the local and European elections on 11 June. Is it any wonder that the Opposition parties smell a rat? Is it any wonder that we see the Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution Bill 2004 as a blatant political ploy, a diversionary tactic or smoke screen to distract from the dismal failures of this dismal Government? So badly are the Government parties doing in the recent polls that they are prepared to play the race card, the last throw of the dice for a desperate scoundrel. The coalition's sense of desperation became evident when the Minister for Finance announced decentralisation for civil servants in lieu of a budget last December; when the Minister for Community and Family Affairs announced her u-turn on the widow’s benefit; when the Minister for Health and Children travelled to Ennis and Nenagh to distribute money and take the sting out of the anti-Hanly report campaign; and when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform once again pulled out of the hat 2,000 extra gardaí, the two new prisons and his magnificent causeway to Spike Island, all without Cabinet approval. Even the Minister’s predecessor, Deputy “Zero Tolerance” O’Donoghue, would not have risen to that level with all of the promises and pledges that Deputy McDowell read out to us.

Election promises may be removed but a constitutional amendment is far more permanent. It is wrong and immoral for any Government to be cavalier and reckless with the Constitution. It is a crime against the people and the democratic institutions of the State, and an insult to the Republic. Already, responsible and respectable voices have been raised against this referendum. All the Opposition parties are opposing the amendment presented today, Labour, Fine Gael and the Greens have tabled an amendment at the outset of the debate urging the Government to go back to the drawing board and adhere to agreed procedures for holding referenda on constitutional amendments as outlined in the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution.

The SDLP has angrily attacked the proposals and categorically denied that it was ever consulted. The DUP has gleefully pointed out that the Irish Government is unilaterally renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement while the parties to the Agreement are sitting in Stormont with strict instructions not to dare to renegotiate any element of the Agreement as it is set in stone and they are allowed only to review it.The Government has played right into the hands of those who wished to destroy the Good Friday Agreement and we will see the impact of and fall-out from that in the coming months. Mr. Bruce Morrison, the former US Senator who did such sterling work for Irish immigrants in the United States in the 1980s and who acquired some 50,000 precious visas for illegal Irish immigrants there has opposed this referendum on principle. The chairman of the Human Rights Commission, the statutory body set up under the Good Friday Agreement, with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, has expressed the gravest concern about the inadequate time scale and the implications of the referendum for the Good Friday Agreement. Mr. Hugh O'Flaherty, the former Supreme Court judge and a well-known friend of the Taoiseach wrote in the latest issue of The Dubliner that “The idea that there should be a constitutional referendum to deal with non-nationals coming here to give birth lacks any rational basis.” He goes on to say that the objection to politicians interfering with the Constitution to provide ad hoc solutions to specific problems is fundamental to a constitutional democracy such as ours. He stated that the role of a constitution is to provide the framework for the exercise of legislative power, that it sets out the headlines, is meant to be far-seeing and its provisions are not to be tampered with at the whim of politicians. These are strong words but there were stronger to come. Hugh O’Flaherty concluded by asking what difference it made if our citizenship laws are more liberal than other countries in the European Union. So what indeed? What is the problem? Why is it so urgent? What are the facts? Where are the numbers?On 19 February, the Taoiseach told Deputy Quinn that he had no intention of holding a referendum this year. Until the end of March the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste denied that there had been any decision to hold a referendum during the forthcoming elections. Suddenly, on 31 March, the Taoiseach discovered "flagrant abuses" of our citizenship laws and the urgent need to combine the local and European elections with a referendum.On 7 April, when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform briefed the parties' justice spokesmen, he reiterated the canard that the masters of the maternity hospitals had pleaded with him for legislative action because of the soaring birth rates to non-nationals. There is still no breakdown, however, of the number of births to non-nationals in the maternity hospitals, despite request after request. He specifically mentioned that he has no precise figures for the Rotunda hospital but there are no precise figures for any of the maternity hospitals. We still do not know how many children were born to the 48,000 migrant workers who were invited to this country from the four corners of the globe by the Tánaiste to act as bonded employees of her beloved entrepreneurs. In the figures trotted out by the Minister, we have not been told the number of children born to parents who, having fled persecution in their own countries, have been granted asylum and refugee status under our strict asylum laws. We do not know the number born to asylum seekers who have had to languish idle for years through no fault of their own while waiting for their asylum applications to be heard. We do not know the number of those referred to by the Minister as citizenship tourists, those wealthy people who fly into Ireland to have their baby, get an Irish passport and fly out again. We just do not know what the problem is or if there is a problem at all because there are no statistics. We are, however, going to change our Constitution.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated that he had identified a problem in October 2002, nearly two years ago. Of course he did nothing about it then. There was no sense of urgency because that was after the 2002 election but we are now in the run-up to the 2004 elections and we must rush this legislation through.We do know, however, that we sold our citizenship to the highest bidder in the 1980s and 1990s. Under the passports for sale scheme, any rich sheikh or shady entrepreneur with a spare £1 million to invest in an ailing Irish business was welcomed with open arms. Occasionally even he and his family were waited upon by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice of the day and the passports were handed over personally in the salubrious environs of the Shelbourne Hotel. Despite my best efforts and the best efforts of the Labour Party to highlight the abuse of the passports for sale scheme, the Minister does not propose to include any provision in his draft Irish nationality and citizenship Bill to address this situation. He does not propose to revoke Irish citizenship from those wealthy foreign nationals who are fugitives from justice, yet who use their purchased Irish passports to travel the world.Victor Kozeny is a Czech national whose career I have been following and reminding the Minister of for some time. On 27 April, the national television broadcaster of the Czech Republic will come to Ireland to cover the ceremony of accession and it has asked to interview me about this man. I would be surprised if the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not been asked for a similar interview.Victor Kozeny is a fugitive from Czech justice facing an international warrant for his arrest on charges of defrauding 800,000 Czech citizens of £3.6 billion. The US authorities are seeking his arrest and extradition on fraud charges involving up to £150 million. The Czech Republic has stripped him of his Czech citizenship but he travels the world unhindered on his Irish passport. In January he announced his intention to use that passport to found a political party, the Civil Federal Democracy Party, and to stand in the first Czech elections to the European Parliament. Without his Irish passport he would be unable to run for election and he would almost certainly be languishing behind bars. I wonder when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will direct his attention towards plugging this blatant loophole. To 800,000 citizens of the Czech Republic, this is a fundamental issue.Yesterday I listened to the Tánaiste on "Morning Ireland" desperately trying to defend the Government's failure to consult prior to the announcement of the referendum. There was no consultation at all with other parties. How could there be when this was the Government's secret election weapon to be kept under wraps until the last moment? As recently as 31 March, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, told the Dáil that no formal discussions had taken place with the British authorities on this subject. By the time the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform briefed the justice spokespersons, he was able to tell us that he had consulted the British Government and obtained its approval for his proposal.The process of amending the Constitution is very important. The Constitution is the fundamental document that defines our democracy and should be treated with the utmost respect.

I have no difficulties with the timing of the referendum because it is my view, as was clearly expressed this morning by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and others, that this problem has been allowed to fester for far too long and it is time we confronted it.Irish citizenship is about much more than entitlement to an Irish passport, it is a badge of identity, a statement to the world of who we are, the essence of our sovereignty as a nation. Is it not eminently reasonable, then, that to become an Irish citizen a person should have a much greater connection with this country than simply being born here? If a person has no connection with this country other than being born here, is it right that he should be identified to the world as a citizen of Ireland? Is Irish citizenship so paltry, trifling and inconsequential? No other country in the EU feels that way about its citizenship.Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar athló.

The same requirement is in place in Greece. The average period of parental residency throughout the EU is five years whereas we propose only three. There was a time when birth alone allowed a person to claim British citizenship, but the law in this regard was changed almost 25 years ago in 1981. The last EU state to abandon the notion that birth gives rise to citizenship was Malta, which changed its law 15 years ago in 1989.The proposed referendum is about protecting the integrity of the notion of Irish citizenship. It is primarily and foremost about the integrity of our citizenship law, whatever the figures may be. That said, it cannot be doubted that the loophole in the law has led to some unfortunate social consequences of which the maternity situation is one. It is a fact that the masters of the maternity hospitals in Dublin approached the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They told him about the pressures to which their hospitals were being subjected by the increasing number of births to non-nationals. That is a fact.

I have received numerous complaints from people in Limerick, Clare and Tipperary about similar pressures on maternity services in the mid-west. On 11 April, The Sunday Times quoted Dr. Michael Geary, the master of the Rotunda Hospital as saying “the concern I have is over women boarding flights from the UK or, indeed, France or Holland, when they start their contractions. It is a very worrying situation and there have been some near-miss maternal mortalities. Some women have severe medical problems so just the fact that they are in labour on a plane results in complications”. These are the people who subsequently tried to imply they were entirely neutral and had no view on the subject at all. They are rather peculiar statements of neutrality.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Of the 3,270 women aged over 16 who applied for asylum last year, 1,893, or 58%, were pregnant. At the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin there were 1,951 births to immigrants last year. Almost 14% came to the hospital between one and ten days before giving birth while about 13% arrived in labour. That strongly indicates that at least 27% of immigrant births, or about 500, were passport tourism cases. Those are the words of the researchers employed by The Sunday Times, not mine.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	568	What is complex or confusing about the simple proposition that a parent of a child born in Ireland should have resided in this country for three years before the birth to enable that child to qualify for Irish citizenship?As his party's spokesman on justice and a practising solicitor, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe will be very well aware that, judging from the volume of case law and material written on the subject, land law is infinitely more complex and detailed than immigration law. Nevertheless, there are aspects of land law which are quite simple just like this aspect of immigration law.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	569	Is the reference to simple things like abolishing ground rents?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	570	For example, if a person with a wife and children dies without making a will, his wife is entitled to two thirds of his property and the children to one. If we proposed to change property law to change those fractions to half and half, three quarters and a quarter or 100% to nothing, everybody could understand the proposal. It is a simple aspect of land law just as this is a simple and direct aspect of citizenship law. That is the reality.The sincerity of a person's case or the sincerity of his attachment to the case he is making can be judged by the quality of the argument he or she puts forward to support it. Judging by the quality of the arguments put forward by the Opposition, I sincerely doubt their sincerity. The first artillery piece rolled out was the Good Friday Agreement, but the British Government soon put an end to that.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	573	Even before the British Government's statement it was evident the argument was threadbare. I refer to a letter to The Irish Times by Mr. Tom Hadden on 14 April. Mr. Hadden who is an expert in this area stated quite clearly that there was no problem. What Deputy Rabbitte says about various soccer players and other sports stars is beside the point. It could be said equally of any other EU member state as the grandfather rule applies in every one of them.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Deputy Costello mentioned the passports for investment scheme. Every Government, including those in which the Labour Party participated, operated the scheme. It was a Fianna-PD Government that in 1998 finally abolished the scheme. Deputy Rabbitte, who was very vocal on the matter this morning, sat at the Cabinet table for three years in a Government that operated the passports for investment scheme. This is not the only country in the world to operate it. This has been operated in countries in every corner of the world.An even more ludicrous suggestion is that the Government is racist. A huge percentage of the immigrant community who come here simply to give birth come from countries where the very fact of giving birth does not automatically convey a right to citizenship. Would those people regard their own countries as racist because they do not give citizenship simply by virtue of birth? I do not think so. Do we consider the other EU countries, in line with whose laws we are trying to change ours, to be racist? I have not heard that argument advanced from any side of the House. I must conclude that we are accused of racism either because we are doing it now — the British did it 25 years ago — or because it is this Government that is doing it.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The next claim is that a constitutional referendum is very complex and that we got it wrong in the past and must live with the consequences. When did that happen? The Constitution has been in existence for less than 70 years. During that time it has been amended on no less than 22 occasions. Regarding 21 of those there was not a scintilla of controversy or criticism. The only amendment to the Constitution which brought criticism in its wake was the amendment incorporating the right to life of the unborn, and the only reason for confusion or controversy arising from that amendment arose because people who advocated it and persuaded the Government of the day to run it saw the Supreme Court interpreting it in a way which they did not like and which they did not anticipate. Ironically, when the people were called upon subsequently to pass judgment on the Supreme Court decision, they decided the Supreme Court was right and that its interpretation of what that article meant should not be diluted in any way. If we argue that we should not amend the Constitution because nobody can foresee at the time the ink is dry on the amendment how the Supreme Court will interpret it at any indefinite time in the future, we should put an end to all future constitutional amendments. If the argument were to be taken to its ludicrous and logical conclusion, we should abolish the Constitution altogether because we can never know how the Supreme Court will interpret any individual aspect of it.The most risible suggestion put forward in defence of this so-called sincere argument is that Article 9 would be in conflict with Article 2 and therefore the whole thing would fall. This argument is put forward despite the fact that the Constitution is replete with examples of untrammelled rights which are subsequently qualified even within the articles. Not only the Irish but all other constitutions with which I am familiar are written in the same way. Deputy Rabbitte who advanced this as one of the pillars of his argument should consult the American constitution.Is the confusion real or is it a smokescreen for something else? Deputy Rabbitte seems to have changed, at least in tone in recent times, particularly since this matter came to be debated. At the outset of his leadership he chose to behave like the political version of an ambulance-chasing lawyer. Now he gives the impression of a man who is cut to the quick, torn apart, even physically stricken by the chicanery, deceit and treachery he sees all around him.

At the end of the Taoiseach's speech this morning, Deputy Rabbitte again declared himself to be sick. I am extremely sorry that anything this Government says or does is having such consequences for as important a part of Deputy Rabbitte's body as his stomach. He said he was stricken again recently by the alleged failure of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, to live up to his high expectations. He did not say what part of his anatomy that affected, and I prefer not to speculate. The Taoiseach should examine his conscience because he again made Deputy Rabbitte sick this morning. I ask my colleagues to desist from any statements, observations, U-turns or betrayals, real or imaginary, that might have any effect on Deputy Rabbitte in the future because there is only so much any one body can take.At the time of the Labour Party conference last year a journalist — I think it was Ms Miriam Lord — compared Deputy Rabbitte to a character from Dickens, Mr. Pickwick. She was talking about his appearance but now a much more substantial reality is conjured up because Deputy Rabbitte's most recent statement brings to mind the famous line from Dickens that Mr. Pickwick looked like a man who was much put upon; so stop making Deputy Rabbitte sick.I conducted an experiment recently, a pilot project, something with which the Labour Party would be familiar.

I have a miscellany of replies which were extremely interesting. Some candidates may count themselves fortunate that I do not have time to read them into the record.I welcome Fine Gael's belated conversion. It is extremely foolish to allow itself to be dragged along in the slipstream of this tomfoolery. We have all heard of the Greek chorus. Far too often Fine Gael has allowed itself to be cast in the role of the "geek" chorus, like a brainless mutt chasing every bone that is thrown at it. My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, once accused Fine Gael of allowing itself to be carried on the alluring tide of populism. Now it cannot even work out which way the tide is flowing. Cynicism or confusion, real or imagined, can be contagious. I admit to being confused about how anybody who has witnessed the minuet of hypocrisy, sanctimonious posturing and fake indignation that has passed for opposition in this debate can wonder why cynicism has become almost institutionalised in politics here.

That is not the debate we are having. That is not the debate the Government wishes us to have. The Government has zeroed in on a very narrow aspect of the citizenship debate and in so doing has exposed its own cynicism regarding how it sees Irish citizenship in the 21st century. The debate on citizenship should not only be about birthright, it should also be about heritage and residency. In trying to make ourselves seem more like Berlin than Boston on this issue, the Government has forgotten that on many aspects our citizenship laws are far from liberal, and that as regards residency, citizenship granted to people who have lived in this country for a considerable length of time depends solely on the whim of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, whereas in other countries such citizenship is granted after a set period of residency.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	588	My birthright gives me citizenship of America. That same birthright gives me rights by heritage to Irish citizenship because my parents were among the thousands of people who left this country in the 1950s when their rights as Irish citizens to earn a livelihood and bring up a family were far from honoured by this State. If the Minister wants a debate on citizenship, it should be on those lines. Then we will be a better-informed society. The reality is that the Government does not want to change the Constitution to bring about the right of the Oireachtas to decide citizenship. This is because the traditional role of the Oireachtas has always been to honour the right of those born in this country to Irish citizenship, which has been its role in regard to all legislation passed since the foundation of the State, through the 1935 Citizenship Act, the 1956 Act and the 2001 Act which implemented the Good Friday Agreement and the relevant constitutional change.The Government does not want to bring about a right of the Oireachtas to define citizenship. It wants its own means to define citizenship in its own narrow way. Members on this side of the House will not stand aside and allow the Government to do this for the cynical reasons it has chosen.

Given what the Minister knows, how can he label as he chooses anyone who dares to disagree with him? There are also those of us with other definitions and values regarding Irish citizenship who would like to contribute to the debate as to how we progress collectively as a nation.The demography of Irish society, due to recent prosperity, is changing dramatically and we no longer have a replacement birth rate. My personal experience of being born in the United States is a good example as to how we might develop as a society. The experience of the United States as a melting pot and a society which welcomed — with different levels of success, it must be admitted — different cultures and collectively became a stronger country, particularly economically, is a model which we should try to put in place in this country. Otherwise, we will put in place a society with dual membership and, as a result, will also have a dual economy where those who are not Irish citizens will service those parts of the economy not deemed attractive to those defined, as any new law is likely to, as proper Irish citizens.

Three weeks ago, the House dealt with the electronic voting agenda and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, now wants to thwart the future of a generation of children at the press of a button.We are told there is a problem in regard to people coming to Ireland to abuse our Irish welcome, that the Constitution needs to be changed and that women are arriving on our shores late in pregnancy and causing problems in our hospitals. However, we are not told what this Government is doing to prevent this dangerous practice. We are told there is a problem but not the scale of the problem. Are we being asked to change the Constitution on the grounds that the Government knows best? It seems so.If someone asks what nationality a person is, the answer usually relates to the country where he or she was born. If one travels through an airport, applies for a birth certificate or completes a CV, the basic question of nationality is usually covered by declaring one's country of birth. It means in most cases where one's national affinity lies. Surely, if one is born in Ireland one is entitled to call oneself Irish and to be treated like everyone else.Immigrants are not lesser beings but are most often highly driven and hard working people who have put their hearts into making better lives for themselves and their families. Immigration stands to enrich Irish society. Irish people come from the same history, are of the same calibre and have much to gain from those who come here with their skills, cultural and linguistic talents, etc. Most who come here do not see themselves as guest workers or temporary visitors. They fundamentally wish to stay and Ireland needs to face up to this and start to integrate these potential new citizens from the start. If we do not we will reinforce a two-tier society where some are rich and secure while others are forced to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty with minimum rights.There is an arrogance to the Government's style, the same arrogance that emerged with the Nice treaty debate when the people gave a clear "No" response. What happened? They were told they had got it wrong and must go back to the drawing board. We are now told that we must slam what is perceived as the back door to Europe in the faces of children. However, Ireland is more than a back door to Europe and the fact that so many from other nations are making this a destination country is a great compliment and a heartening indication of the positive light in which Ireland is seen throughout the world.Rather than rushing into a referendum, the Government needs to formulate an adequate immigration policy. The future cohesion of Irish society will rely in part on a proper management of immigration. The issue of integration also needs to be addressed and open discussion on the issues is essential. A rushed referendum will stop any chance of such debate.Sinn Féin is opposed to this referendum and, at the very least, is calling for its postponement to allow for a proper debate. Bruce Morrison, who has been supportive of illegal Irish emigrants in the US and a friend of the Irish peace process, spoke recently in Ireland and stated it is long past time for Ireland to face up to its new role as a destination country and that role involves hard choices and important investments. If we do not create adequate immigration laws, we will pay the price down the road. As Bruce Morrison pointed out, we have a chance to get it right now if the Government would approach the matter in a responsible way.The Immigrant Council of Ireland has also expressed concern at the proposed citizenship referendum, stating the Irish people have a right to consider any possible changes to the Constitution on the issue of citizenship. The proposed referendum asks people to vote on the fundamental principle of Irish identity. We own the Constitution and if changes are to be considered, then it is important that voters have the time to judge the implications.There are also concerns that the proposed new legislation on citizenship may contravene long established aspects of human rights as outlined in Articles 2, 5, 24 and 26 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights and Article 26 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 7.1 of that convention states that the child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. Article 7.2 states that parties shall ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with their national law and their obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, particularly where the child would otherwise be stateless.On every important human rights issue the Government has sidelined the Human Rights Commission, the institution established to make informed judgments on these matters. We had the Immigration Acts 2003 and 2004, the Equality Bill 2004, the liquor Act 2003, the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 and the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. True to form, the Minister overlooked the Human Rights Commission when making this proposed change. If the Government insists on railroading us into this referendum, it should at least allow sufficient time for all the information to be analysed so the public can make an informed decision. The people should be given credit for their intelligence. We have the right to make our own decisions and not to be pushed into situations to suit the Government's agenda. If the referendum goes ahead, Sinn Féin will ask the people to vote "No".
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	630	One of the most recent arguments put forward by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government for the proposed amendment is that citizenship must involve fidelity to the nation state or, as the Taoiseach said today, we must protect the Constitution. That argument is exceptionally hypocritical. The Constitution is being used or abused in an opportunistic and populist ploy to salvage the declining electoral support for the Government parties. That is the opposite to fidelity to the State. I hope the electorate will see this proposal for what it is, namely, a contrived ruse to distract attention from the real political issues, such as the chaos in the health service, the criminal control of house prices by a handful of billionaire developers, the incompetence of the Minister in failing to tackle the drugs gangs which plague many of our communities, the increasing inequality in our society at a time of great affluence for the wealthy and the endemic corruption in certain political circles. These are only some of the key issues which should exercise the minds of the electorate.These issues, together with the deliberate misleading of the voters at the last general election, spell disaster for Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats at the forthcoming local and European elections. Some cute manoeuvre was required to avoid a serious defeat in the June elections and this is it. I do not blame the Minister for it. I note the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is grinning, which is what I would expect because Fianna Fáil is brilliant at cute manoeuvres. This is a classic Fianna Fáil stroke. It produces a populist gimmick to distract attention from its appalling misgovernment and to neutralise the Opposition and then it smirks, like the Minister of State, all the way to the electronic count.

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	632	That is what this referendum is all about. If changing the Constitution and altering the Good Friday Agreement, which was carried overwhelmingly by the people, was not a gimmick, what would be the normal course of action? The problem would have been clearly spelled out at the beginning and the full facts and figures would have been made available. The matter would then have been referred to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution where all-party discussions could have been initiated, as provided for in the programme for Government. All the parties in the North would have been fully informed and properly consulted. In this way appropriate consideration could have been given to the key question of the constitutional provisions on citizenship to establish if any change in the Constitution was required to prevent any abuse of Irish citizenship by anyone, whoever that might be.As was correctly stated recently, the Constitution should only be amended when the need to do so is clearly and unambiguously established. It should be the last resort of legislators, yet in this case it is the Government's first port of call. The real abuse of the provisions of our Constitution is not being done through the scapegoating of asylum seekers, but through the cynical unprincipled elements of this Government. I hope the people see through this attempt to fuel prejudice because it will achieve little else.If passed, what will the amendment achieve? Even if we accept the Minister's vague statistics, all that will happen is that a few hundred babies will be refused Irish passports. I remember when I was in school in the 1950s and this country was impoverished, we put our pennies into the boxes to save the black babies. Now that we are among the world's most affluent nations, our Government is seeking to scapegoat babies for political effect. This country and Fianna Fáil in particular have come a long way.

I respect the opinions of the Deputies on the other side of the House, but any Deputy who says this is a ruse to influence the electorate is way off the mark. Deputies should stop insulting the intelligence of the electorate. To say that people from a Labour Party or Fine Gael background will vote Fianna Fáil because of this referendum is to insult their intelligence. People have political affiliations. Just because the referendum will be held on the same day as the local and European elections does not mean people will be encouraged to change their vote to Fianna Fáil.As someone who comes from the constituency of Wexford where a significant number of asylum seekers have come through the port of Rosslare and set up home, I am aware of the circumstances in which many immigrants find themselves. The majority of politicians in Wexford have behaved in a sincere way towards people who have found themselves without friends, family or support. There have been one or two outbreaks of racism but, on the whole, there has been little bad feeling towards asylum seekers and those who come to live in County Wexford.There are approximately 400 to 500 Romanians, Nigerians, Algerians and others living in Wexford town. In Enniscorthy there are over 100 Nigerian families. I am of the view that people may live for four to five years in a constituency but still not feel at home there. Those to whom I refer have few rights. The legislation will change the position and give them the opportunity to become Irish citizens. Many of these people have children and have been living in my constituency for longer than three years.The matter we are debating today is probably one of the most clear and defined to have been put to the electorate in a long period. Much political gain has been sought in recent days in implying that this issue has been rushed forward. However, it is a matter of public record that this proposal was put forward as part of the programme for Government almost two years ago. How long should we continue to debate the issue without taking action? There has been adequate debate and what is needed now is to allow the people to have their say in a referendum.When enacted, the Bill will provide that in cases where a child is born to non-national parents, at least one of them will have to have been resident in Ireland for three or four years prior to the child's birth before the child can become entitled to Irish citizenship. This is in line with the citizenship requirements for any non-national marrying an Irish national to obtain citizenship. As public representatives, we have all regularly come into contact with Irishmen or women who have married people from other countries and whose spouses wanted to become citizens of this country. These individuals must undergo a particular procedure overseen by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is sometimes four or five years before they become Irish citizens. The legislation is very much in line with the existing system.The Bill brings Ireland into line with the rest of Europe. It is as simple as that. Ireland is unique at present in respect of the fact that citizenship can be obtained by virtue of being born here. In the majority of other EU countries, citizenship is obtained through being descended from an existing citizen. The leader of the Labour Party earlier made a number of assertions. In particular, he made reference to Government candidates in the forthcoming local elections making political gain from this matter or including racist material in their election literature. I wish to point out to Deputy Rabbitte that, as far as I am concerned, I am sure it is the same for the majority of Deputies, the literature distributed by candidates for the forthcoming elections contains no reference to this matter. I have been out canvassing with councillors from my party in recent weeks and I have not seen any reference to the referendum in their literature. Perhaps reference has been made to it in some parts of the country——

Things are said at elections which do not stand up to scrutiny and such will be the case with some of the statements made here today.I have been a Member of the House for 21 years and I have never seen such a straightforward and basic concept become so quickly clouded on foot of various ill-informed sources spreading rumours and misinformation. As already stated, I deal with a large number of non-nationals in my constituency who seek advice on a multitude of issues. I am sure the position is the same for Deputies in other constituencies. Most of these people are only interested in knowing how to go about obtaining a travel visa, work permit or whatever. Fundamentally, they all seek clarity on the procedures they must follow in order to achieve their goals.The Bill will allow for the procedures to which I refer to become clear, concise and totally transparent to anyone wishing to obtain citizenship for their children in the future. No longer will cases have to be taken on a case-by-case basis in the courts.The Bill is about clarity. Is it anti-immigration? No, and neither is it racist; it is designed to eliminate a loophole whereby the children of two non-nationals qualify automatically for citizenship of this State. All the political parties and those who have already spoken during this debate have indicated that problems exist and that there is a need to close the loopholes. However, there are some who question the manner in which this is being done. The record of the Government in assisting immigrants is possibly second to none. Every effort is made to aid and support them when they are in this country. It is important not to lose sight of that fact.I pay tribute to the different groups and organisations which have tried to make life that bit easier for the significant number of immigrants who have arrived in this country during the past seven to eight years. The local vocational school in Enniscorthy has allowed a significant number of immigrants to become involved in PLC and other educational courses. These individuals are not allowed to work but if they become involved in such courses they can be re-educated and given opportunities in the community. The local clergy and sporting clubs have done everything possible to facilitate their entry into the community while they are waiting for decisions to be made in respect of their future.It is a matter of concern that the racism slur has resurfaced. The word "racism" has been bubbling under the surface of every exchange that has taken place to date in respect of this matter. No one other than the extremists has used it but it still lingers as a direct accusation in respect of the Government. I wish to place on record my complete rebuttal of this underlying accusation. The Government has been most proactive in looking after immigrants.Opposition parties have again decided, en bloc, to oppose an initiative of this Government and misrepresent what is being attempted. Members of the Opposition are slow to admit it but the loophole that exists must be closed. They are too concerned with attempting to convert this simple but pressing issue into a political football. They wish to present it as a complex constitutional issue. This is opposition for the sake of opposition. However, I do not believe that members of the electorate are as naive as the Opposition makes them out to be. I agree with the Taoiseach that the electorate know and appreciate the choice being offered as an obvious one. We have an opportunity to do something on 11 June and I am sure the correct choice will be made. This will eliminate abuses of our Constitution.I hope this debate will continue in a calm and controlled fashion and that the slurs of racism being directed across the floor of the House will cease. I also hope that we will arrive at the correct decision. As already stated, Deputies Kehoe, Howlin and I have been working to ensure that people who arrive in Wexford are given the best reception possible, that they are not treated in some form of racist manner and that they are catered for and dealt with as they should be dealt with when they arrive in a place where they have no friends or neighbours or anybody to look after them. The statutory authorities, social welfare officers and local community welfare officers have been doing a tremendous job in trying to deal with this issue.There are loopholes in the system and that system is being abused by certain individuals. It is important to eliminate such abuses by passing the referendum in order to ensure that people have the right to become Irish citizens through the proper channels and not in the piecemeal manner that exists at present.

At the outset, let me agree wholeheartedly with his closing remarks. I sometimes think that in this House we live in a completely different world from the outside world.

From listening to Ministers and Deputies from all parties who are on the ground there is no hint or undertone of racism in the local elections, so far. To suggest, as many Members are suggesting, that the proposal before the House is in some way influencing the people in a material way in these local elections is completely without foundation.What I have learned in my few short months in this House, and Deputy Durkan has been a Member for a much longer period, is that every time the Opposition is losing the argument, it simply will not listen to anybody else with a contrary point of view.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	650	Those who are losing the argument simply do not want to listen. At the core of the debate are some very simple questions about whether we deal with our immigration and citizenship policy through our Constitution or in legislation? There is no doubt that when one analyses the arguments cogently, the Constitution is no place to include detailed provisions on citizenship and immigration policy. At the heart of the debate is the question of how to deal with immigration policy in this House and in the country? I make the case that the Constitution is no place in which to make policy. The 1937 Constitution delegated to the Oireachtas the power to formulate policy on citizenship and immigration, little though there was at that stage. I believe that was the correct and proper way of doing it. Unfortunately, one of the unforeseen consequences of the referenda to change Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution was that we inserted in the Constitution the basis of citizenship. I believe that was a mistake. Many people who studied those proposals foresaw that this would be a difficulty. At the heart of this debate, we have to discuss the right way to deal with our immigration and citizenship policy. I believe it is best dealt with through detailed legislation. The reason I say that is that 20, 30 or 40 years ago there was practically no inward migration to this country. If one was born in this country, one worked and died here and very rarely did one leave the country. Now the world is completely different due to a range of factors, including non-stop cheap airline travel all over the world, which is a unique feature of modern life, employment migration and asylum seeking by those suffering persecution in their own countries which is enhanced and facilitated by easy access to airline travel.A feature of modern global living is the international education of students. The concept of global citizenship is something with which we will have to deal now, which we never had to deal with previously. For those reasons, a bland line or two in a constitution stating that if one is born in a country, one has a right to citizenship, does not take cognisance of the complexities and the nuances of the modern world. I am no expert in the field, but the expert group comprising former Attorneys General, judges and constitutional experts came to the same conclusion seven years ago when it reported to the Constitutional Review Group, stating that provisions on citizenship have no place in the Constitution.

Before that, citizenship rights were derived from the Citizenship Act 1956 and not from the Constitution. That was the right and proper way to deal with the issue, but unfortunately it was an unforeseen consequence of the Good Friday Agreement.

I know this was an issue at the last general election and it is an issue now. It was signalled in the programme for Government that the Government would take action on it. To level the accusation now that it is being done as a short stop-gap measure coming up to the local election is unfounded.There is no doubt the provisions in the Constitution, as amended in 1999, have been abused to a greater or lesser extent. I cannot say with my hand on my heart the extent of the abuse but I know there is abuse.

The essential question which has to be dealt with is how we deal with modern complex citizenship and immigration issues. It should be dealt with by legislation in this House. For that reason I support the referendum.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	663	It is important that the two-day debate on this issue is separate from the debate on other issues of Dáil business. It is a very important debate and it is being misconstrued in many ways by the failure of the Government to offer leadership to the country in facing this very difficult issue.My fundamental point is that the Government has failed to consult other parties on the issues and timing of this referendum and has failed to listen to the views of Members on this side of the House and other eminent people outside this House, who are involved with refugees and immigrants. At the core of the debate is a fundamental decision we have to make as a nation. The problems with the Government's attitude is that it is pushing ahead without that consultation and consent, North and South. I watched a recent appearance by Mark Durkan on the television. He was giving his views on the consultation he apparently had with some lawyer or official from the Department of Foreign Affairs over dinner at a restaurant in Derry. That is not good enough, given the divisive nature of racism and the fundamental nastiness of racist people in this country. They are in all political parties and in none. Their allegiances are across the board. We need to have this debate during a period when the focus will be on the issues, not the individuals.To hold this referendum on the same day as the local elections will cloud the issue and, more importantly and sadly, will give a voice to those who are most racist. There are people who will tell the candidates: "I will vote for you if you will stop this immigration and stop black people and people from outside the European Union coming to this country". Some people are not prepared to admit it but I have met a significant minority who hold that view. Holding the referendum on the same day as the local elections gives a mandate to racism or racist views.The Government has failed to offer true leadership on this question. It should nominate a special date, even the date of the presidential election, to hold a number of referenda. Last week a report which was well publicised and well supported was produced by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. It deals with private property. Why not have a referendum on that important issue, which has all-party support, on the same day as the referendum on this issue? Would that not be the most rational and responsible thing to do? Would it not receive greater support from across the country and from all groups and parties? The Government has failed to do that. It is a failure of leadership on the part of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste. I listened to the recent interview with the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, on "Morning Ireland". She was really snookered for a reply when she was asked if she had consulted with people about this issue. She clearly had not. That is where the Government is wrong and where it has failed. That is the reason this process is going the wrong way.Why do people want to come to this country? Why do they need to come here? What is so attractive about modern Ireland that they want to be part of it? It is because Ireland is a wealthy nation and provides the people who live and work here with a wonderful standard of living compared with that in Third World countries. If we were Nigerians or lived in Afghanistan or eastern Europe, we would want to be part of this society. We would especially want our children, if we could get into this country, to have the future this country can offer them.This does not just apply to Ireland. This is a European issue. Much has been made of the British Government's support for what this Government is doing. However, what Europe is saying, in effect, is that it wants to close its borders and does not want any more people coming into Europe because of its economy and special needs. If one country is out of step, it has to change its way. The attitude is that we are all together on this issue.Fundamental to this issue are the problems of poverty, Third World countries and selfish capitalism, in the historical sense, taking everything and not looking after the poor of the rest of the world. What the European Union ought to be doing and what this Government should support, and people such as Deputy O'Donnell in her capacity as a Minister of State was particularly good on these issues, is investing outside the European Union to make those countries wealthier, give stability to their economies and generate equity. We should treat them in such a way that they can develop their economies so migrants will not have to come to Europe or Ireland because their economies will be stable and progressive and their native countries will be attractive places in which to remain. That is the fundamental philosophical issue that is missing from this debate. It is something we should address as members of the European Union but the Government is failing to do that. It is failing to look at the big picture.The Deputy from Limerick spoke about what he called "global citizenship". There is global citizenship. The news that bombs went off in Basra in Iraq today is known all over the world. We are aware that Diego Maradona was sick after going to a football match because we saw the report on the television two days ago. We all know about his condition today because we are citizens of the world.Inequalities in wealth and health cause people to migrate and to come to this country. Much has been made of the babies of non-nationals being born in our fine maternity hospitals. Only the negative aspect of those births is being considered. The attitude is that it is awful more babies are being born to people from other countries. We forget, however, that the birth rate in Ireland is falling. Irish citizens do not have enough children to fill the jobs that already exist and that will be available in the future. Let us face that reality.The other reality relates to health care. With more people coming to this country, bringing with them difficulties and diseases that do not exist in this country at present, there is a greater need for better and more specialists operating in our maternity hospitals to improve their services. One can argue that the 700 women who came from the UK to have their babies in Ireland is one thing but the Russian woman coming from Moscow with a great deal of money is something different but it means we have a world class maternity service which people want to use. Part of that has been driven by the arrival of immigrants.What about the immigrants in this country, whether they are refugees, asylum seekers or whatever? They live in places such as the Butlins holiday camp or the houses built by speculators which the health boards can afford to rent for them. What is the problem? Is it a problem with race or with colour? I do not believe it is. These people cannot work so Irish people see them and their children on the streets. They are not allowed to work, yet there are labour shortages in the economy.Last year approximately 50,000 work permits were granted by the Department for non-nationals to work here. What are we doing with the immigrants and refugees who are already living here? We are chartering aeroplanes with 30 or 40 gardaí on them and returning these people to Nigeria or eastern Europe. Where is the sense in that? Surely it would be more sensible to look at the qualifications, skills and knowledge of the people who are already in this country and match them to the job vacancies. If these people can give our country something unique and special and if they can fulfil our skills needs, why not let them stay? What is wrong with the Government that it is not considering this? I challenge the Minister to change his view and to look again at this issue.I listened with respect to the Minister of State's speech. I understand and appreciate the work he and his colleagues are doing in Wexford. However, we should do more work on this. We have a black and white attitude; we are not putting enough thought into it. I can give an example. A gentleman from Romania came to live in Drogheda. He was a wonderful musician who had been a member of the state orchestra in his native country. He and his family lived in Mosney and became part of the community. The children went to the local school. What happened to them? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said they had to leave. I appealed the decision, as did others, but the community in Drogheda lost the best musician it ever had. He was a professional musician and wonderfully committed to our community. It is not purely a matter of economics. There are social and cultural issues to be considered as well. How much do we do in Ireland to celebrate all the different traditions and communities represented in our society? How constructive are we in pushing forward anti-racism policies and the view that all the people who are here are welcome, along with their cultures, and that we want them to share their wealth and their heritage with us as much as possible?We are not looking at the big picture. We are listening to the whispered voices in the back rooms, the muttered words in the pub when a black person goes by. We are listening to the wrong voices. We are not making the right decisions. We are making decisions not because they are morally right but because they are politically expedient.These decisions are narrow and mean-minded. We must also examine our own history, that of the Irish people from the 16th and 17th centuries when the Irish nation began to emerge. Is it not true that for generations our citizens left our shores, went to the UK, Europe and America, were welcomed there and became part of those societies? America then was a bit like Ireland is now: it needed more people. It did not have enough qualified people to fill its jobs and it welcomed those from all nations. It is a much bigger country than Ireland. The Irish people who emigrated sent back the money to send Pat and Mary to school. They used it to look after their sick parents and grandparents. What are the immigrants in Ireland doing today? They are doing exactly the same.In this debate I would like us to see the bigger picture. We need a better country, a better Government, more leadership, more consensus and more nation-building. We do not have these things and we will not get them. That is why some very negative thoughts are being expressed during this debate. This does not need to happen and it will not if the Government will reconsider its decision.I will return to the issue of timing. What we want is consensus. What we are entitled to is calm, reasoned, measured debate such as that taking place over these two days.

Many on this side of the House, particularly in my own party, do not have a fundamental problem with the ultimate decision that must be made. Our problem is the lack of consultation and the fact that this vote will take place on a day when other issues will dominate the debate — negative issues, particularly that of racism, will be to the fore. We have no personal problems with people on the other side of the House, but the integrity of every party here is being fundamentally examined. Is there a more fundamental human right than that of citizenship? Is it not the case that this debate should take place in the absence of confusion, ignorance and racism? The only way to do that is to show leadership: to put all those things aside and decide to hold the referendum in November or January or any other time. No major change will take place — there will not be an influx of millions into the country in the meantime. There will, however, be an opportunity for the Government to show leadership and concern and do its business on behalf of the people, especially by bringing everybody together. That is what this Government is failing to do.What is now dominating the debate is the lack of concern, arrogance and ignorance of some people — I am not talking about those in the Oireachtas — who will drag this debate into a darker place. Their thoughts should not be given the benefit of expression. The Government must think again. It is not too late for the Taoiseach, Fianna Fáil and the PDs to show leadership and take the honourable course. They must listen to what we are saying and ensure this debate takes place in a cool, calm manner, which will not happen if things continue as they are.

I welcome the opportunity to express my support for this amendment of the Constitution and the legislation being proposed by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and endorsed by the Government. It is important that we debate this issue calmly and reasonably. It is important that we have an informed view of the concept of citizenship and that of membership of a modern nation state. Watching the debate so far, I have seen attempts to suggest that the nationality clause of the Good Friday Agreement has not led to any exploitation or any increased pressure on the health services. As Minister for Health and Children I must state that this is completely erroneous. Those who work in our maternity hospitals — not only the three hospitals in Dublin but those across the country — have explained to me the significant impact of the number of non-national births and the high percentage of female asylum seekers over the age of 16 — as many as 60% — who are pregnant. That has had an effect on our medical services. It is important not to try to pretend this has not happened. It has.I have visited maternity hospitals and spoken to staff in different disciplines. They are all of the view that many of these people come to Ireland in full knowledge of the fact that giving birth in Ireland would——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	684	I just want to be able to say a few words about this, if I may.Two issues were raised by the masters of the maternity hospitals and other obstetricians. One was the impact of the fact that up to 60% of women over 16 attending the hospitals — asylum seekers — were pregnant. That creates pressure on the service. There is also the issue of funding. They also raised the issue of what we intended to do about the problem. They did not give me a legislative or constitutional prescription, but they clearly asked about our proposals for dealing with it.That is the reason for the meetings. They had two concerns, the first had to do with resourcing and the second was what to do about it. They were definitely of the view that the nationality clause was being abused and had facilitated this development. I can give the Deputy an example although I will not go into detail. The real concern related to the complexity of the cases that are arriving, for example, the lateness of the arrival. These cases created additional pressure on resources, not just on the obstetrics unit but on the neonatal units. That is the reality from which we cannot run away. There was one case that was relayed to us in correspondence from an obstetrician in a particular hospital which involved a quintuplet pregnancy. The person arrived 36 hours previously and took serious risks in making a long journey to reach Ireland and to give birth. The consultant told us that the person arrived in a very threatened premature labour situation. It was a scenario that raised serious concerns for the hospital with regard to the safety of the delivery and the fact that the woman placed her own life at risk by making such a long journey. We discussed the issue of carriers and airline responsibility. This is not just a single case. Doctors and nurses spend so much time dealing with such high-risk pregnancies and if the person had gone into labour during the flight the consequences would have been catastrophic.I met with the masters of the maternity hospitals in December 2002, when they outlined the concerns they had on these issues. Particular concern was expressed for the wellbeing of these patients who were presenting in increasing numbers in these circumstances. We worked with the ERHA and developed the screening unit and outreach maternity clinic in Balseskin, north Dublin, to try to reduce pressure on hospitals in these situations. The Rotunda Hospital has seen non-national births increase from approximately 350 in 1998 to 1,951 in 2003. Non-national births accounted for over 29% of all births at the hospital in 2003. At the Coombe Women's Hospital, non-national births have increased from 61 in 1999 to 1,709 in 2003. Non-national births accounted for 22% of all births at the hospital in 2003.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	692	Non-national births at the hospital accounted for 20% of all births. The health board specifically approached us following the build up at Mosney. There is a direct correlation between that and the pressures on the maternity and obstetric units in Drogheda. The point is that most people are under no illusion that this nationality issue is a factor in this growth. Let us not deny that. There seems to be a notion that if someone says that, then he or she is a racist.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	694	Let me give the example of the Southern Health Board. There are ten refugees and 545 asylum seekers in the SHB area alone. There are 564 non-nationals who are not refugees nor asylum seekers. There were, therefore, 1,119 births to non-nationals in SHB hospitals out of 6,000. That is a substantial number. Some of them tend to be complex cases. If we have a system in Ireland that is incentivising that pattern of behaviour then we have to do something in the interests of all concerned. There are real health and safety issues here for the individuals and families concerned. People are taking risks to avail of what is available here, both the citizenship facility and possibly the quality of our obstetric and maternity care. It is only in the context of debates like this that I hear people like Deputy O'Dowd celebrating that fact in Ireland. In the normal course of a debate on health, I get the opposite commentary.Even though the asylum seeker numbers have fallen, about 60% of girls over 16 arrive pregnant and there has been no significant changes since the recent Supreme Court judgments. While there is a demand for funding, there are limitations to what we can achieve or what we can absorb in this area. We have to be practical. Consultant and midwifery strength cannot be increased overnight.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	696	We have done it successfully. The people to whom we have spoken on this issue and who work in this area are in no doubt that one of the great incentives is our unique facility in Europe, whereby one is automatically a citizen in that situation. What we are doing in this amendment is bringing Ireland into line with its European partners. No other European state has this facility. We are still more liberal in comparison with our European partners on this issue. I get a sense that much of the opposition to this is more political and about timing than about the substance of the debate. That is not a good enough reason to oppose this because the Constitution exists for Governments to go to the people on issues that fall under that Constitution. It is then a matter for the people to decide. Governments in the Oireachtas have a right to put issues to the people. There has been a tendency recently to suggest that more time is needed to debate these issues. That is not a tenable position to adopt and is not one that I would commend. There are other countries that have referenda and others do not because they do not have written constitutions.The feature of Irish citizenship law which grants an entitlement of citizenship to all persons born in the island of Ireland is unique in the EU. It is very unusual worldwide. Most other countries have laws whereby citizenship is acquired by descent from an existing citizen, and place of birth is wholly or largely irrelevant. It is clear that it does make Ireland an attractive destination for persons wishing to establish residence, not just here but in the EU. This has given rise to these figures since 1997, which are quite extraordinary. We should not wrongly label people who put forward a modest measure to deal with the situation.
#OllieWilkinsonFF	unknown-#OllieWilkinsonFF-party	unknown-#OllieWilkinsonFF-dob	unknown-#OllieWilkinsonFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. With modern travel, only a few hours on a plane will take one half way across the world. The world is definitely a smaller place now and it is time we did something to regulate the situation. We are not denying citizenship to anybody. There is no doubt about that. However, speaking to one humane and talented medical practitioner in a maternity hospital over the past week, I was left in no doubt that there is great pressure on staff and patients because of the current situation. There are great health dangers and language difficulties with people who arrive on our shores in the latter stages of pregnancy. The medical person to whom I spoke said many accidents were just waiting to happen. The Government is courageous and correct to tackle this question at this time.The Republic of Ireland is the only EU member state to grant automatic citizenship rights and therefore an EU passport. This is a fact we cannot ignore. A referendum on the citizenship rights to children born to non-national parents is a reasonable response to this problem. Most of the Members opposite agree this problem must be addressed. They agree one should not be automatically entitled to Irish citizenship as a birthright. At the same time, however, they accuse the Government of being racist for proposing a referendum. They blatantly contradict themselves in an attempt, perhaps, to confuse the electorate. To describe this referendum as being racist is political correctness gone mad. In this country we run the risk of avoiding rational political debate because certain public representatives will accuse one another of being extremist or reactionary. We cannot pretend there is not a crisis in our major maternity hospitals.This referendum is not about race. Those who suggest it is are twisting the facts. The comments of certain members of the Opposition constitute irresponsible politicking. They assert that this Government is placing racism ahead of nationalism, as regards the citizenship referendum. This is totally untrue. It is a slur against the Government and the Fianna Fáil party. The referendum has, as its focus, the theme of nationalism, providing non-nationals with the opportunity of citizenship. It is certain members of the Opposition who have introduced the "red card" into the debate. That is a wrong tactic.Racism is serious. It has ruined many lives through the centuries. To make such an allegation is an insult to those who have suffered, or are suffering, as a result of racism. Certain Members are using the issue of racism for political gain when they are well aware that it has nothing to do with this referendum.One point the Opposition is ignoring is that the referendum is not affecting the asylum seeking process. Neither has it anything to do with it. Those who need the protection of asylum here will still go through the proper channels to attain citizenship. Certain Members try to make out that the Government is trying to prevent non-nationals from entering. The Opposition has deliberately twisted the issue. This approach is opportunistic, irresponsible and wrong. The Opposition is well aware the referendum is about the removal of a loophole in our system that has seen citizenship rights being abused.The referendum is not about immigration procedures. It is not about race. It is about ensuring that Irish citizenship is not abused. We are entitled to bring the Constitution and our law on citizenship into line with European Union countries, so that we do not create unintended incentives that are unfair to us or to other member states. The Bill provides that in the case of a child born to non-national parents at least one will have lived in Ireland for three of the four years preceding the birth, before he or she is entitled to Irish citizenship. Where either parent of a child born anywhere in Ireland or the UK is a national or long-term resident, the child will still be entitled to Irish citizenship. I fully support the referendum.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	698	I was a member of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which produced the sixth progress report dealing with the referendum process. That report was prepared with great care and diligence. The Chairman, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was key to defining the recommendations in it. Under his guidance clear consensus was arrived at that what was being presented was a reasonable and thoughtfully prepared framework for holding referendums that would protect the public interest from Government abuse and incompetence. Regrettably, the approach of this Government as regards the particular referendum proposal is diametrically opposed to the recommendations in that report.The recommendations were short but comprehensive. One was to amend the Standing Orders of this House to embody the presumption that every TD and Senator would have sufficient opportunity to contribute to the debate. That is not being complied with. In fact the truncated debate today flies in the face of such an inclusive approach. Limited time is being allocated outside a normal Dáil session in order to rush through a Bill about an issue of citizenship that deserves proper and calm deliberation, but regrettably it will not get it.Another recommendation was that the Standing Orders should provide for the establishment, as necessary, of an all-party Oireachtas committee, either before a Bill is being printed, where the exact terms of the proposal need to be formulated, or after the Bill has been printed. There is need to evaluate the issues on the basis of a review of the knowledge of experts and the presentation of insights from groups outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, and for the publication of a report. Again, the Government is totally disregarding this approach. In fact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is being reckless at a time when reflection is called for. His is a dishonest approach, when deliberation is required. He stated this morning: "I see no reason this matter should be referred to the Joint Committee on the Constitution, since by their stances already publicly expressed on the Government's proposals, at least two of the parties represented in this House have declared their opposition."That is irresponsible. There is clearly no attempt to seek out any kind of party consensus on this. It is evident, particularly in this House, that the Government is showing arrogance and disregard for an issue such as this that needs to be attended to, as far as possible, within an all-party framework. What is most disturbing about the Government approach, however, is its contempt for the parties in Northern Ireland. It is not acceptable to me as a Member of this House to find the leader of the SDLP being so concerned as to criticise the Government with regard to that contempt. That is not the way good politics is practised. What we see here is a Minister, who certainly is not lacking in intelligence, but has no political sense at all as to what is appropriate when it comes to his responsibilities with regard to the Constitution and the Good Friday Agreement.To have ensured that there was all-party discussion and time and space provided for hearings would have led to the best possible outcome on what is a complex issue. Putting our heads together on this issue is still the preferred option rather than being at loggerheads, but that is not what this is about. This is not about finding the best solution to a problem we all recognise exists. This is about taking an opportunity to damage the Opposition while trying to maximise support for the Government.We all understand that Fianna Fáil and show politics go together, but Fianna Fáil and the PDs, in particular, are moving this into dangerous territory which goes way beyond the normal bounds of electioneering. Having listened to the contribution of the Minister I am deeply dismayed. The temperature has already been raised. This constitutional amendment is not about asylum seekers, as Deputy Wilkinson said. It is not even about immigrant workers. However, a Minister used this opportunity to send out the kinds of signals that give licence, as Bruce Morrison so well put it, to bring out the worst in people.Deputy Wilkinson is an honourable man but I wish he would keep his lectures for his own party.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	700	Already the evidence exists in this regard among members of his party, as has happened in the past. Fianna Fáil is not above using the race card and it is doing so again. I have the text of a document from Councillor Sheila Gallogly that was sent to me by e-mail. I do not know her, but I understand she is a Fianna Fáil candidate in the forthcoming elections. Under the heading "referendum on citizenship", she outlines her opposition to an open door policy and refers to asylum seekers, refugees and the referendum. It is clear she is linking fears people in her area may have about immigration in this regard to maximise her position for political advantage. That is a sample of the evidence that exists. These are early days and, regrettably, we will see worse.It is a great shame the PDs have lost any kind of principle they may have once had because the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and Deputy O'Donnell in their days seemed to be able to find the gumption to fight and resist this kind of political opportunism. What happened to that? It has all dissipated. What happened in respect of the great stand the Minister, Deputy McDowell, took about "one-party government — no thanks"? We have one-party government, ably assisted by the PDs, to shore up the Fianna Fáil vote in these elections. "Bad government — no thanks" is what the Labour Party would say and this is bad government. It is bad, incompetent government to rush through a constitutional amendment that is legally flawed, has not had proper debate and deliberation and in respect of which no attempt has been made to find all-party consensus on this difficult issue.This is a real issue and we should remember it is also about very vulnerable women in the late stages of pregnancy. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about women delivering babies. That is sometimes forgotten. It is as if hordes of pregnant women are lining up and we have to make sure that they do not break through the barricades. We do not know how many of them there are. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not know and neither does the Minister for Health and Children, but the latter knows he has an opportunity to use these people as an excuse in regard to the problems that exist, particularly in our maternity hospitals.I accept there has been a large increase in the number of non-nationals giving birth. There are many non-nationals, many of whom are far away from home, living here. If many of them were not here our hospital service would have collapsed and our nursing homes would not be operating. We need and depend on these people. They are good people and some of them get pregnant and come to our hospitals to deliver their babies without anything problems arising in their final days of pregnancy, and what happens? They all get bundled into the figure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform keeps promoting, namely, that one in four people who give birth here are non-nationals, as if one in four of the people who give birth come off the aeroplane in labour in order to get their citizenship. That is a dishonest approach. It is a frightening approach in terms of its implications as to how it can be promoted by unscrupulous candidates on the Government side. Even at this late stage I ask the Government to adopt the approach that has been spelt out in the report.During the campaign on the last referendum on abortion the then Government tried to use and manipulate the masters of the maternity hospitals, but that backfired on it. This time the masters were determined they would not be used twice and they set the record straight. They did not plead with any Minister for a change in the law. That is not true and the Minister has put the record straight on that. I do not consider it is appropriate for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to use Dr. T. K. Whitaker and his expert group in the same way to shore up his argument. I would prefer to listen to Dr. T. K. Whitaker if he has anything to say on this issue because the Minister is an unreliable witness and cannot be trusted.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	701	I am glad to have a brief opportunity to contribute to this debate. There is something surreal and unreal about this debate. It is a debate on a constitutional amendment. It is more important than any normal legislative debate we have because it is something we are recommending to the people to put into our basic law which subsequently cannot be changed without reference to the people yet again. However, we are meeting in special session. This is an unreal day, so to speak. We have not had normal Dáil business, there is no Question Time, Adjournment debate or votes, and not too many Government Deputies are present. We are meeting in special session today and tomorrow for time to be used up in order that the minimum constitutional provision of 30 days can be squeezed in so this referendum can be coupled to another vote in respect of which the Government is vulnerable.I want to deal with the issue under a number of headings and I want to be as reasonable and balanced as I possibly can. In regard to a constitutional issue, a coherent and compelling case must be made for change, but we have not heard it. There was no attempt in advance of the drafting of this proposal to build a political consensus on this issue. As late a speaker as the second last Government speaker, the Minister for Health and Children, could not disentangle the figures because the first case made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that somehow our maternity hospitals are being swamped by people using our Constitution and the right of citizenship by coming to this country to have children. However, he could not give the base figures for that. All we got were the global figures in regard to these matters that have been clutched at by every speaker on the Government side, as if they did not include female workers in Intel from America, Filipino nurses who are welcome here, the tens of thousands of workers from across the globe who are welcome here or people from the applicant countries to the European Union. They are all bundled into these figures to give the notion that a quarter of all births in our maternity hospitals fall into this category.We then have comments such as anecdotal evidence and two hard cases given by the Minister for Health and Children. There is no logical link to suggest that 24% of all births relate to a group of people arriving here heavily pregnant, motivated only to achieve Irish citizenship. There is no compelling argument for that claim. We have not heard it. Let us hear it. If there is such an argument, there is a willingness on this side of the House to address it.We need only recall the previous experience we had with amendments that were rushed through or ill-thought out, authored by the same Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which I had the privilege to shadow for a number of years. The last such legislation with which I dealt was the referendum on judicial conduct. I reread the Minister's contributions on that and all his speeches in that regard. He said with absolute certainty that his proposal was watertight, perfect, finely tuned and right. However, it imploded under the weight of logical argument and the proposal was never put to the people. Nobody has had any sight of it since.I am wary of the certainty that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government present on constitutional amendments. The Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill was debated on Second Stage in the House but was subsequently withdrawn. On 2 May 2001, the Taoiseach informed the House: "I do not like the idea of having a referendum without the agreement of the House. That has not been a practice of the House." I agree with the Taoiseach that it is not the practice of the House, so why is it being done on this occasion? Why is the Taoiseach abandoning his own standard and the precedent he set for the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill? In every other amendment, there is normally some degree of cross-party discussion. The Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill was ostensibly withdrawn because of the lack of political consensus. There is no rhyme nor reason to proceed with an amendment without any political consensus. With this Bill, no attempt has been made to build such a consensus. If a case had been made for a resolution of this issue, the parties would have found a mechanism to deal with it. A mechanism for amendments to the Constitution was established by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution when ably chaired by Deputy Brian Lenihan, now Minister of State. Why is the very procedure he set out now to be shredded and abandoned?The Labour Party leader, Deputy Rabbitte, dealt in detail with the implications of this amendment on the British-Irish Agreement and the disingenuous parsing and separation of it from the multi-party agreement. Both agreements must be construed as a whole as the multi-party agreement is an annexe to the British-Irish Agreement and cannot be disaggregated from it. Such an action is disingenuous and dangerous to the peace process and the maintenance of progress on the path to peace in a difficult time. The new basis for citizenship proposes that children of UK citizens born in Ireland will have an automatic right to citizenship. The Government speaks of closing loopholes, yet what if a non-national giving birth in this country declares that child's father is a UK national? Will DNA tests be done to check the veracity of such a claim? Is there a provision for a research board to test paternity? It is not proper to be frivolous on such a subject but I was told, rather tongue-in-cheek, that this will give a new dimension to the Kilburn High Street notion of giving someone a start. Now, if one can declare that the father of one's child is a UK national, there is an entitlement to Irish citizenship. The grandparent rule will not be changed meaning a different standard for the grandchildren of Irish citizens who can claim Irish citizenship but may never have set foot in the country or have any affinity towards it. Yet those children who were born and live in Ireland will have no such right.The timing of the referendum is also an issue. If any Member is concerned that the Government would run this referendum on a racist basis, then he or she should read the speech of the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. He told absolute falsehoods to the House when he claimed that those of us on this side of the House argued for an open door policy. I recall no Member on this side of the House arguing for such a policy. His little litany of invective plays well to the agenda of those who will stir up the basest forms of racism. His was a rant about what this side of the House favoured for immigration policy. An interesting start to the debate that does not augur well for balanced and reasonable argument in the future.What is the extent of the problem? How should it be addressed? Is there a mechanism, short of requiring a constitutional amendment, that has not yet been explored? If the problem exists, is there a better way to deal with it to avoid unnecessary rancour? I know some of the Government backbenchers are uneasy. Even at this late stage, I ask the Government to disentangle this issue from the local and European elections. If a case can be made that there is an issue, a consensus can be built to address it. I guarantee the good will of this side of the House to address such a real issue in the interests of all current and future Irish citizens.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	702	If Deputy Howlin claims that a compelling case has not been made, obviously he did not listen to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the start of the debate. Then again, with all the heckling, how could he have heard?I welcome the opportunity to address this important issue for the country. This Bill is about bringing Ireland into line with the rest of Europe. The programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the need for constitutional or other measures that might be required to address the number of applications for residence being made by non-national parents of children born in the State. The constitutional amendment proposes to return to the Oireachtas the power to decide the citizenship entitlements of people born on the island of Ireland, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill seeks to ensure that in the case of a child born to two non-national parents, at least one of the parents will have been resident in Ireland for three of the four years before the child becomes eligible for Irish citizenship.This compares favourably with other EU member states. Spain, Sweden and Greece do not grant citizenship to children born to non-national citizens. Instead, citizenship can be gained through declaration when the child is aged between 18 and 20 years in Spain and between 21 and 23 years in Sweden. For the latter country, this is remarkable considering how liberal it is in its modus operandi. In Greece, when a child reaches 18 years, he or she can apply for naturalisation. The position is similar in Italy and France. The Government is proposing to bring our citizenship regime into line with Europe. The Irish regime will still be one of the most liberal in the EU if this amendment to the Constitution is passed. Irish citizenship law, which grants an entitlement to citizenship to all persons born on this island, is unique in the EU.The general EU model is a law whereby citizenship is acquired by descent from an existing citizen, place of birth being largely irrelevant. In every other EU state citizenship is provided only to children of citizens or permanent residents, or to a child born on its territory after a set period of residence in that State, usually quite a long time and after attaining a certain age. The Government seeks to bring Irish citizenship law into line with the rest of Europe. It cannot be credibly asserted that this move is illiberal or unduly uncaring.I listened to Deputy Rabbitte in an interview over the weekend and I may be incorrect but I think I heard him refer to trying to prevent pregnant women from boarding a plane in the first instance. That raises Deputy Howlin's point about perhaps having paternity cases. Can Deputy Rabbitte tell us how he would envisage people being prevented from boarding aeroplanes in other countries, that is if the women travel by aeroplane? Most asylum seekers arrive by other means, particularly from across the Border. How can one have an arrangement such as Deputy Rabbitte envisages whereby, in effect, people are tested before using the  modus operandi to come here, whether by aeroplane or ferry?What is standard elsewhere is hardly unreasonable for Ireland. The Supreme Court judgment of 23 January 2003 in the L and O case clarified the position of the non-national parents of Irish-born children. The judgment decided that the non-national parents of children born in Ireland had no automatic right to reside in Ireland. In the 13 months since the L and O case there has been no significant fall in the percentage of non-nationals arriving heavily pregnant into the State. This is clearly a cause for concern. The most logical conclusion to draw from this fact is that non-national parents perceive an advantage by giving birth in Ireland to a child who automatically becomes an EU citizen. It is also logical to conclude that because this does not happen in any other EU state, it happens here because those states do not share our citizenship laws regarding birth.The data available from the Office of the Refugee Application Commissioner shows that over the past year the number of asylum seekers pregnant at the time of application was almost 60% of the total female applicants over 16 years of age. Approximately 25% of all births in public hospitals in the Dublin area last year were to non-nationals. When births in other hospitals, in particular in my constituency, Drogheda, are taken into account, the national figures are far higher. Data supplied by the masters of the three Dublin maternity hospitals show that those hospitals had 4,824 births to non-nationals in 2003.Article 9.2 of the Constitution states, "Fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State are fundamental political duties of all citizens." Citizenship is a precious thing and we cannot allow it to be acquired without consideration for that loyalty and fidelity, as required by the Constitution. The parties opposite are, in effect, calling for citizenship without responsibility. We need to be clear about that fact and they should state their views on this issue. We are also confident that these proposals are in line with the Good Friday Agreement. The draft legislation follows the definitions used in the British-Irish Agreement. In his speech, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred to Deputy Quinn's comments in the run-up to the finalisation of the Good Friday Agreement. Fianna Fáil in Government was central to the delivery of that Agreement and would do nothing to undermine it.It would be extremely cynical for any party or Member of this House to play the race card on this issue. I urge all parties, inside and outside the House, to turn from this small-minded, reactionary route. For anyone to attempt to charge this debate with race issues will undermine not only his or her credibility and arguments but also the public's confidence in his or her ability to develop and put forward policy on asylum, citizenship or multiculturalism. It will undermine the vision of Ireland as a country mature enough to debate citizenship free from racism. I was disappointed to read that already Deputy Rabbitte has spoken of unleashing a racist undertone and the creation of a racist platform. This proposal does no such thing.It is the duty of all Oireachtas Members who are in leadership positions in their communities to defeat all efforts to create such racist platforms or undertones. It is equally disappointing that Deputy Kenny asserted that the Government wants a divisive and contentious debate that could generate racist commentary. Let us keep race out of this referendum. It is baseless to assert that for the Oireachtas to be given more power to debate and enact laws on the issue of citizenship is racist or in any way empowers racists. The Cabinet considered in detail when to hold this referendum. We rejected the idea of a referendum to coincide with a potential presidential election. The incumbent President would be excluded from comment on the issue especially as the parties opposite would seek to turn any presidential election into a race referendum. We also rejected the notion of holding it on a standalone basis because there are lower turnouts for such referenda. This could result in a higher relative vote from both radical sides of the debate which would be undesirable. Multi-issue polling draws a higher, broader turnout. That is why we chose the date of the European and local elections. We also intend to deal with the citizenship issues at length in the subsequent Dáil debate.The proposal to return to the Oireachtas the power to decide the citizenship entitlements of people born on the island of Ireland, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen, is to be commended to the House. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill 2004 seeks to ensure that in the case of a child born to two non-national parents, at least one of the parents must have been resident in Ireland for three of the four years before the child becomes eligible for Irish citizenship. The House should reject outright any attempts to stoke a racist fire in the name of political expediency.

This is a very sensitive issue to address. I had some work prepared but I will not read from it as I do not like reading from scripts in general. Following some of the television news reports about this debate this afternoon, to accuse the Government of encouraging xenophobia and racism might seem rather negative or disingenuous, given that many people have valid qualms about the right to citizenship. Nevertheless, I will say it because that is happening on the doorsteps.During the debate on the Immigration Bill on 29 May 2003 I raised with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the attempt to attract white Anglo-Saxons as opposed to everyone else who wants to make a better life here. The Minister was very indignant and accused me of constituency envy. I would not envy Deputy McDowell in any constituency and am happy to live in Dublin Mid-West. It is a rapidly-growing and extremely multicultural constituency where one is as likely to see a person from Mozambique as from Montpellier within the towns of Lucan, Clondalkin, Newcastle, Saggart, Rathcoole, Brittas and Palmerstown.Any debate on citizenship or immigration brings out the worst in people. When campaigning, if we ask people about issues of importance to them, they invariably bring up immigration. They are entitled to raise the issues of immigration, people's entitlement to come here and the working conditions they should have because those are valid concerns. Unfortunately, in the absence of a proper civic debate similar to the Forum on Europe, we are left with rumour and innuendo. At every third or fourth house I visit, I meet someone who tells me there are a lot of blacks in this country and that his or her neighbour knows one who waves a big cheque, gets a free car because he has been racially abused on the bus and gets free haircuts. It is absolute claptrap, a total urban myth that must be condemned. At any chance that my colleagues and I get, and any chance any Member of this House gets, because thank God there are no real fascists here, we must refute those arguments. During an election campaign, however, when people are canvassing, they have two or three minutes to ask for a vote and there is no time for a detailed debate on race, immigration, asylum and citizenship. We listen to the soundbites, say they are not true but do not have a chance to scotch the rumours.This should not be an issue where Deputies appear on "Oireachtas Report" ranting and raving; it must be thought out. It is my firm belief that by holding this referendum on the same day as the local and European elections, the issue will be clouded by urban myths and I believe the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, his party and Fianna Fáil are fully aware of that. That is the nub of the issue.My colleagues have mentioned the impact of this on the North and Article 2 and Article 9 of the Constitution. We need a proper debate on citizenship without any ranting and raving and without the urban myths. Many of those living in my constituency are from other countries. Some of them now have Irish citizenship and are very good citizens, better in many cases than those who were originally born here.A debate on citizenship should take place outside the cauldron of electioneering. That is why I am asking the Government to reconsider its position — for the reasons outlined by the parties in the North and the parties on this side of the House. This debate is not about citizenship, it is about fanning the flames of racism outside the House. Impressionable people who are not inherently racist sometimes listen to urban myths and suddenly believe we are being overrun by citizenship tourists. This is a totally false premise and if the Government were being honest it would hold the referendum at another time in the year and not in the heat of an election.

There is a distinct lack of information about this topic and a perception that the Government is using it as a smoke screen to obscure the real issues — the broken promises, the 21 people regularly on trolleys in my constituency, the people who cannot go to the local GP because it is so difficult to get a medical card and they cannot afford to pay for a visit.

It is not just non-nationals who are arriving in an advanced stage of pregnancy or without ante-natal care. In my surgery my wife, who is not medically qualified, has assisted in delivering two babies who could not make it as far as the hospital. People are always on the move now and these things happen when airlines carry people in the advanced stages of pregnancy, it is a fact of life in a modern nation.There are problems when a woman arrives in hospital from an area infested with AIDS and who might have the disease and not have received ante-natal care. They present challenges for maternity units but this referendum is not the answer to those problems, the answer is to grant the resources that are needed to address the situation.It is presumed that people are arriving to take advantage of citizenship opportunities. That might happen but the number involved is very small. If it is so small, why are we doing this? It is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, it makes no sense. It would have been more sensible to have passed the issue to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Why did that not happen, as would have happened with other matters related to the Constitution? That it did not fuels the existing cynicism.How many women are coming here heavily pregnant and how many arrive in labour? At what stage of pregnancy are these women when they arrive? This is information we do not have. The figures the Minister provided are very global in nature. They fail to outline the exact situation. It appears we are dealing only with a couple of hundred people.When a Government is not prepared to commit resources, it creates a smokescreen or commissions another report. I do not understand why a report was not commissioned to consider this matter in more detail before deciding to hold a referendum. Perhaps it is deliberate. The Government may not want to know the true figures as they would expose the whole farce. We should have learned from past referenda that amending the Constitution to address a possible abuse by a few hundred people is ludicrous to say the least.We depend on non-national doctors and others. I implore the Government not to throw out the baby with the bath water which is exactly what we are doing. We have much more important things to do than to take away the cead míle fáilte from those who need our help as we needed help in former years. Our greatest export was once our people which is why we should not adopt this course. We should get real about this issue and postpone the referendum.

I have thought carefully about the issue and tried to inform myself. I have listened to those of my constituents who have raised the matter with me. It is not all one-way traffic. There are divergent views and differing legal and political opinions. As this is where we are, we must decide what to do. A number of issues are involved and it is important to resolve them. The central questions involve identifying the issues and the ways in which to resolve them.The phrase which continually occurs to me and seems to encapsulate the debate is "unintended consequences". Unintended consequences occur where something happens which we do not expect. In December 1999, we intended through the 19th amendment to the Constitution to recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to be accepted as Irish, British or both as they wished. That was the objective of the Good Friday Agreement. Our vote in that referendum extended citizenship rights to every person born in Ireland and its islands, a right enshrined in Article 2 of the Constitution. Some of those who voted "Yes" in the referendum intended that to be the case and, of these, some may have changed their positions subsequently. Others never intended Article 2 to stand as written. Everyone in each category, however, voted "Yes" and for many there were unintended and unexpected consequences. The issue of unintended consequences is one of the central questions we must face in the coming weeks.Changing or amending the Constitution should be a last resort. We should only take such action when no other options are available. Apart from the 1999 amendment, many consider the second referendum on abortion to have had unintended consequences. People felt their intentions when casting their vote were not reflected in subsequent court judgments. This is one of the reasons we must be careful to avoid unintended consequences. Must we have a further referendum or will Article 9.1, which states that the future acquisition and loss of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with the law, suffice? Is that not a vehicle with which to deal with the current problem?An unintended outcome of the proposal before us may be that it inadvertently and unexpectedly unravels the Good Friday Agreement. While the British and Irish Governments tell us the Agreement will remain rock solid after the referendum, many parties and individuals question their judgment. Mr. Mark Durkan has called the proposal a scrambled referendum. Dr. Ian Paisley and the DUP welcomed the proposal which they see as an opportunity to unravel and unpick the Good Friday Agreement. As an unintended consequence, that would be a disaster. The issues at stake are neither simple nor straightforward. An honest and genuine attempt to consult all parties North and South must be made.The All-Party Committee on the Constitution must be engaged and a Green Paper produced to deal with this matter justly, fairly and in keeping with the wishes of the people. Above all, this issue must be tackled in a manner which does not land us in the quagmire of unexpected consequences. I agree with Mr. Mark Durkan who described this as a scrambled referendum. That is the last thing we need. While there is an issue, we are dealing with it in haste when one should never amend the Constitution hastily.Many Members accuse the Government of being political on this issue, although I will not do so. That is an accusation for the spin doctors. I am only interested in the outcomes of our actions. I heard promises from the Government in this House of consultations which might have produced a joint and agreed approach. Consultation with Members did not take place. Mr. Mark Durkan said of the Northern parties that the Government first ignored them and then dismissed them. He was notified of this matter after the fact, not at a briefing or meeting, but during a chit-chat over lunch. Some of the chat was on the record and some was off it. Why do we have an All-Party Committee on the Constitution when the Government does not see fit to consult it and seek its advice? When will the referendum commission be established? Its function will be to explain the referendum to the population, but with just over seven weeks to polling day, are we not skating on thin ice? If the Government intends to inform people fully, should the process not already have started? Does the fact that it has not confirm my view that we face a scrambled referendum?Another issue of concern to many is that on 11 June most people will vote on three different matters. They will use the electronic voting system for the first time. I have heard Ministers tell us how aware the people are and how this will not pose a problem for anybody. While canvassing over the past two weeks, I have met many people who expressed concern. In the north western constituency, which covers almost 40% of the land mass of this country, people who vote will have to be aware of local and regional issues, local and regional politicians and the implications of a referendum on the Constitution. They will twice have to press a series of buttons to indicate preferences and vote and, subsequently, they will have to press another button to vote "Yes" or "No" in the referendum. I am not underestimating or undermining the intelligence of the electorate; I am reflecting what people are telling me on doorsteps.While there is an issue to be resolved, we must deal with it in a manner which does not result in unintended consequences. I accept that in dealing with this matter we have a responsibility not only to ourselves and the will of the people, but also to those who find themselves in the unfortunate position of arriving here in the late stages of pregnancy. As a woman, I can only imagine their fears and hopes for their children. We have a responsibility also to our European neighbours. All this must be taken into consideration before we embark on a scrambled referendum.I referred to our responsibility to our European neighbours. Sometimes, a Boston versus Berlin debate takes place here. Perhaps we should have one now and look not just to Europe, but to the USA and Canada also. We should remember the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who went to those countries. Their millions of descendants form the Irish diaspora of which we are fully proud. That diaspora exists because the USA and Canada granted citizenship to those who were born on their shores. I heard the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, say that those who went to those countries were not asylum seekers. Would he have said that to the Young Irelanders, the Fenians, those sent to Botany Bay? The Statue of Liberty welcomed the huddled masses. Her message is, "I will lift my lamp beside the golden door". It seems that if there are any golden doors in this country we are closing them.
#NoelGrealishPD	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-party	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-dob	unknown-#NoelGrealishPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	719	I support the Government's proposal on citizenship. The reasons we need this amendment to the Constitution are straightforward. Our current citizenship law needs to be changed. Under our present law, citizenship is being given to people with little or no connection to Ireland or to its people. Such people will in turn be able to give Irish citizenship to their children and grandchildren. It is wrong that Irish nationality can be given out in this manner. Just as it was wrong for Irish citizenship to be sold for high prices under the passports for sale scheme, so too it is wrong for Irish citizenship to be given away free as if Irish citizenship, Irish nationality and the Irish nation meant nothing to us.We saw the case of Mrs. Chen, who consciously went to Belfast to have her child born there so that she could argue that, with an Irish citizen child, she should have the right to reside in the UK. Irish citizenship law is being used to circumvent UK immigration control through the use of European Union free movement rights.We have problems in our maternity hospitals which are symptomatic of the problems in our current citizenship law. The master of the Rotunda Hospital has, according to the Irish Independent, warned that it is surprising that there has not been a major catastrophe within the maternity services yet. The figures for Dublin’s major maternity hospitals show that approximately a quarter of births are to non-nationals. More than 80% of the births to non-nationals are to citizens from outside the European Union. That means approximately 20% of births at Dublin’s major maternity hospitals are to citizens of non-EU countries, or approximately 4,000 births a year in Dublin alone. Many of these were births to EU citizens or to non-EU citizens working here who are perfectly entitled to remain here with their children. However, it is believed the majority were to other non nationals.The other problem, as Mr. Tommie Gorman of RTE reported last Sunday, is that health professionals in Belfast have noticed an increase in the number of non-nationals giving birth in hospitals there who are using temporary accommodation addresses and who are aware of Irish citizenship law. Non-citizens are going to Belfast and to other parts of Northern Ireland in late pregnancy to confer citizenship on their children.For a variety of reasons, Irish citizenship law needs to be changed. I am not alone in holding that view. Deputy Enda Kenny has been reported as accepting that there is "a problem of non national persons arriving here particularly in later pregnancy". Even Deputy Rabbitte was reported last Saturday as stating that we cannot leave the door "wide open".To change our citizenship laws we need to change the Constitution. That is the legal advice the Government has received. I am not a lawyer and therefore not in a position to contradict that point. However, it seems the current wording of Article 2 of the Constitution is clear: "It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation". What does entitlement to be a member of the Irish nation mean if it does not entitle somebody to Irish citizenship? The upshot of this is that if we want to change the current automatic entitlement to Irish citizenship for those born in Ireland we must change the Constitution.If we change the Constitution, will the Government bring in a citizenship law which would be unduly harsh? In this legislation we have the answer. The Government has not merely produced its proposed amendment to the Constitution. It has also produced the draft legislation it will introduce in the event that the amendment to the Constitution is carried. This draft legislation was analysed by the Legal Affairs Correspondent of The Irish Times, Ms Carol Coulter. She concluded that if the legislation were enacted into law, Ireland would still be “one of the more liberal states in the EU from the point of view of citizenship”. Here is a person with no reason to particularly favour the Government point of view saying that if the Government’s proposals were accepted we would still have a liberal citizenship law. This is the answer to those who charge that the current referendum is racist.I note that Deputy Cuffe is reported as indicating his party's support for an organisation called The Campaign Against the Racist Referendum. I am disappointed that he and his party would ally themselves to those who bandy around the word "racist" so casually. I am disappointed that a Member of the Labour Party who is not a TD referred publicly to "the racists in the Department of Justice". I oppose racism. However, I also oppose applying blanket terms of abuse to people not only because of their race, but also because of their professions, their political views or their employer. We should condemn and combat racism but we should also fight the wider problem of sectarianism and abusive behaviour. It is not merely wrong to unfairly and negatively label a person because of their race. It is also unfair to label a person as racist because they work in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I hope that, in time, the Green Party and the Labour Party will dissociate themselves from those who instrumentalise the term "racist" to unfairly abuse people against whom they offer no evidence of racism. Unfortunately, some people seek to identify so much with their followers that they cease to offer them leadership away from mistaken positions. Unfortunately, some people seem to believe that stating they are against racism means never having to say they are sorry. In my book, self-righteousness is no excuse for doing wrong.One major difficulty is that none of the Opposition parties has produced its own detailed proposal on this matter. Instead of proposing something constructive, individual Opposition Deputies have remained in simple opposition mode. I was relieved over the weekend when Deputy Rabbitte announced that the Labour Party will shortly bring forward its own detailed proposals on this serious matter. I hope other parties and individual Deputies will bring forward their own proposals. In the absence of competing ideas on how to deal with the issue of citizenship, there is a danger that the people will be offered no choice but that between a Government proposal on one side and disunited chaos on the other.The situation is straightforward. We need to change the law of automatic entitlement to citizenship for those born in Ireland. To do that we need to change the Constitution. Even after we have changed the Constitution and enacted legislation, we will still have one of the more liberal immigration regimes in the European Union, so what is the problem?One issue that has been raised is the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement. I can understand that the SDLP has its own political instincts which it wishes to articulate. That is perfectly legitimate. I can understand that the SDLP, having laboured for years to install a new constitutional arrangement on this island, does not wish to see that arrangement threatened. However, the SDLP should be reassured by two facts. First, the Irish State operates in accordance with law. It would be unlawful for the Irish state to breach a binding international agreement such as the Good Friday Agreement. It is unthinkable that the Attorney General or his predecessor, the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, would propose legislation to this House which would involve us in a breach of the Good Friday Agreement. Second, the Government's proposed legislation follows exactly the detailed definition of entitlement to citizenship set out in Annexe 2 to the Good Friday Agreement. Far from breaking or threatening the Agreement, we are following its detailed provisions.A second issue raised is the issue of the time required for the people to decide this question. People do not need much time to decide on the question of whether somebody with no prior links to Ireland should be automatically entitled to Irish citizenship merely because they were born here. People do not need much time to decide on whether the Oireachtas should have the power to determine the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen or is entitled to Irish citizenship.A third issue is whether the referendum should take place on the same day as the local and European elections. I note that the Opposition has not stated when it believes the referendum should take place, just that it should not take place on 11 June. There are only two practical alternatives to holding the referendum on 11 June. We could wait until the presidential election later this year. That election might never take place. Furthermore, it would be grossly unfair to drag presidential candidates into a referendum on citizenship.

This would involve extra cost. It would probably involve a lower turn-out. Worst of all, there would probably be a greater danger of racist tendencies and unthinking abusiveness surfacing if the referendum were held on a stand-alone basis than if it were held on the same day as local and European elections where it will not be the sole focus of political attention and debate. I favour holding this referendum on 11 June as this date would be best for a balanced debate, a higher turn-out and for limiting expense.The Opposition's proposal is that we should refer this matter to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. That is a mistaken proposal. The fundamental issues are straightforward. Should children born in Ireland get automatic citizenship even if neither parent has any real connection with Ireland or with the Irish people? A referral to an all-party committee would make sense if there were complicated issues which needed teasing out but there are not. It would make sense if this was a problem we wanted to be seen doing something about but did not know what to do. However, we do know what to do. It would also make sense if we wanted to talk rather than take action but we do not.If one had a leaking roof, one would not ask how many gallons per hour were coming into the house, sit down with one's extended family to decide whether there was a need to fix the leak, or spend time holding an architectural competition for a new roof. One would phone for help and set about fixing the roof immediately. However, under the Opposition's amendment we would sit down and have a lengthy chat while the problem got worse. On the issue of citizenship, it is not more talk or analysis of the options for action that is needed because all options for action lead unavoidably to constitutional change. If we do not do that, no other action to solve our problem is possible.This must have been clear to the Opposition when it tabled its amendment which portrays clearly its fundamental problem, namely, while the Opposition can agree what it is against, it cannot agree what it is for. Without an agreed alternative, all it can manage is to agree to defer the problem, distract us from the issues and dither while we offer a solution. Instead of the mantra of "reduce, reuse and recycle", the Opposition strategy is one of "defer, distract and dither". The Government cannot afford such luxury but is condemned to take responsibility and must act.

It would be no such thing — it would be a coalition of the careless. We can see what to expect from the Opposition's current conduct of the citizenship issue. Instead of principle we would get posture; instead of action we would get talk; instead of solutions we would get continued problems.The Government is right that there is a problem with current citizenship law which was not intended when we approved the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and we can only fix that problem by amending the Constitution. If we amend the Constitution and pass the Government's proposed legislation, we will still have, "one of the more liberal states in the EU from the point of view of citizenship" according to Ms Carol Coulter of The Irish Times.This referendum will not alter the rights of individual Irish citizens, north or south of the Border, or those entitled to Irish citizenship to automatically confer Irish citizenship on their children, or change the citizenship position of those who already have Irish citizenship. The question to be answered in the referendum will be simple, namely, should children born in Ireland get automatic citizenship even if neither parent has any real connection with Ireland or with the Irish people? The answer of the Irish people will also be simple.In conclusion, if we are to protect the integrity of Irish citizenship and behave as good neighbours to our fellow EU members, we should pass this referendum. The Opposition's proposed amendment is an attempt by those who cannot see what is wrong to distract those who know what is right. I reject the Opposition amendment and commend the Government's proposal to the House.

Fine Gael accepts there is a problem, although the Minister did not seem to think it a significant one until very recently. However, there would not be the slightest problem if the referendum was to take place on its own next October, after going through the relevant Oireachtas committee. Knowing this, why did the Government decide to hold the referendum on 11 June?I was in the House some time ago when the Leader of the Opposition asked the Taoiseach whether a referendum would run in conjunction with the local elections on 11 June. The official answer was that it was not planned to hold such a referendum. From where has the significant demand come? Could what is to be done on 11 June not be put back until October?I listened attentively to the Minister's speech in this debate.

One of his problems is that he does not listen. The Taoiseach said there was not to be a referendum on 11 June, which is on the record. What has happened in the meantime so that, as a matter of great urgency, it is necessary to hold the referendum on 11 June?I thought the Minister would come to the House today with dramatic figures to show there was a significant flow of non-nationals into our maternity hospitals, that the number was increasing every month and that this month was the highest of all. However, he did not say that. Instead, the Minister and several Government Deputies used the phrase, "It is believed". What is believed? Ireland gave out over 40,000 work permits over recent years to a cohort of people, mostly of child-bearing age.

I am long enough in the House to know there must be a good reason for this.I took the Minister at his word before and after his meeting with the masters of the maternity hospitals, and had no reason not to do so.

Why foist this referendum on the people on 11 June when electronic voting will be used, which will be a major problem for many citizens? There will now be three, if not four, ballot papers in most places. Why does the Minister want to foist that on an electorate which has sufficient problems without this referendum?

Canvassers will be asked many searching questions on the doorsteps about the Government's stewardship of the economy for the past two or three years. There is a significant gap between the rich and the poor in this country. The Minister thought the best way to camouflage the problems was to introduce an issue which would dominate the airwaves. He wanted to ensure an intellectual debate. I do not know if he is right or wrong, but the people know what is going on. They want to do the right thing. Citizenship is an extremely important treasure for people throughout the world and it is no different here. However, the Minister and the Government are cynical about this issue. They do not want to discuss the problems in local government, the health service and elsewhere which are thrashed out here on a daily basis. They hope to win the support of the electorate on this issue. It is a cynical exercise. I hope the people decide for themselves the real reason for this amendment.I know there is a problem in this area, but I do not understand why a referendum could not be held next October, irrespective of whether there is a presidential election. What is the difference between a presidential and a local government election? Why could they not be held on the same day? I do not understand that. We may not have a presidential election. How many times have we held a referendum on its own? I remember a number of them over the years. If it is as important as the Minister believes, why could we not have a good day out next October?

Government backbenchers are trying to claim they are the Government and the Opposition. It suits them to say in their constituencies, particularly in south Cork, that this legislation should not be rushed through, yet they all vote the same way in the Dáil. We saw that during the debate on the widows' pension and other issues. They claim they are against something, yet they support it in the Dáil.I was interested in the speech given by the Minister for Health and Children, which was extremely good. He stated that this country is an attractive target. We know some people target this country. However, he has not made the health service attractive for Irish or non-national mothers and babies in Cavan and Monaghan. When I was in Cork recently, I received an emergency telephone call from a parent in north Monaghan who wanted to get a child into the centre of excellence in Drogheda but who had been told by the family doctor that the hospital had been taken off call because gynaecologists or paediatricians were not available. They were told to send the child to Cavan General Hospital, which is full, or to Tallaght. Yet the Minister says our country is attractive for mothers and babies.

As politicians, we must deal with people with disabilities. It is absurd that this legislation, of which the Taoiseach denied any knowledge a few weeks ago, can be rushed through the House, while people with disabilities are being ignored. It was only last year, when the Special Olympics took place here, that the Taoiseach claimed he was responsible for everything. However, that matter has been ignored and this issue is now being addressed.I made it clear at the outset that Fine Gael is not opposed to this issue, rather it is concerned about the way in which it is being addressed. I represent a Border area and I have a keen interest in the peace process. However, there are those on the benches behind me who, from time to time, try to make out that I am not committed to the peace process. They should consider my record of involvement in farming and other organisations over the years. I know people in every county in Northern Ireland.The peace process, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement came about on the basis of trust and open discussion. I was alarmed to learn that the leader of the SDLP, a group which was one of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, was not properly consulted on this matter.

My party leader, Deputy Kenny, is the type of person with whom the Taoiseach and the Minister could at least discuss this issue. However, the record does not show such discussions taking place. This is a constitutional matter and it is being rushed through the House.The leader of the Minister's party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, stated that she has been aware of this matter for six years and that it is part of the programme for Government. Surely if she knew about it for that length of time, there was some potential for bringing together the main Opposition parties and the main groups dealing with the Good Friday Agreement to achieve some sort of consensus on this matter. It may be difficult for the Minister to accept but there has been a total failure on his part.We have been informed as to why this matter should be dealt with quickly. Deputy Grealish referred to a leaking roof and how one might deal with such a problem quickly. I agree with him because I was involved in the structural seal business for some years and I received many calls for work to be carried out as a matter of urgency. The Deputy is correct about leaking roofs but this is not an emergency issue because the problem has not arisen overnight. For example, it is only today that the Minister provided some broad figures. We accept that something needs to be done but this is not the sort of emergency to which Deputy Grealish referred. There are many other issues in respect of which urgent action is needed. I refer, for example, to the 200,000 people who were informed two years ago that they would receive medical cards.

It was stated yesterday that gardaí have been detailed to deal with matters relating to the European Presidency and have not been available for traffic duties. I will be attending the funeral this evening of a child who died as a result of someone speeding.There are a number of matters in respect of which Deputy Grealish's philosophy should be used. I wish to refer to one example, namely, insurance. Unfortunately, there are no members of Fianna Fáil present to hear my contribution. The leader of the Deputy's party has held the position of Minister in an extremely important Department which deals with the issue of insurance. He should approach her and communicate to her the philosophy he outlined earlier. The Government is trying to deal with the matter before us in a period of four to five weeks. It should try to deal with the insurance issue so that small businesses and others will not suffer as a result of the total failure to deal with it in the past. The philosophy of the leaking roof is very good and it should be put into action. The Minister is doing what is right but he is doing it in the wrong way.

There are really only a few simple questions which we need to answer in order to convince ourselves that the Government is following the correct course.Is the current law on citizenship satisfactory? The answer is clear: the current law on citizenship is unsatisfactory. It is noticeable that no party leader of national standing has attempted to argue that the current law on citizenship is one with which we can be fully satisfied. The reasons I find the current law on citizenship unsatisfactory are straightforward.First, I am concerned that citizenship is being given to those with little or no connection to Ireland and to its people. Such individuals will then in turn be able to give Irish citizenship to their children and grandchildren. It is wrong that Irish nationality can be simply given out in this manner.Second, when we consider the Chen case, it is clear that Irish citizenship law is being used to circumvent UK immigration control through the exercise of European Union free movement. People can argue that, with an Irish citizen child, they have the right to reside in the UK or any other EU country. We in Ireland should not allow a hole in our back fence to create problems for our neighbours in Britain or those throughout the rest of Europe. We should fix the hole to which I refer not only for our own good, but also for that of our neighbours.Third, a difficult situation in Irish maternity hospitals has been made significantly worse as a result of our citizenship law. The master of the Rotunda Hospital has, according to the Irish Independent, warned that it was surprising that there had not been a major catastrophe within the maternity services yet. Do we have to wait for a catastrophe before we are prompted to act, as the Opposition seems to suggest by its proposed amendment?Fourth, Tommie Gorman of RTE reported on Sunday that health professionals in Northern Ireland had noticed an increase in the number of non-nationals using temporary accommodation addresses giving birth there. There may be others in RTE who do not like that message or who seek to contradict it, but I believe what Tommie Gorman said.Can we change the current unsatisfactory situation without changing the constitution? The answer to this question is that we cannot. The legal advice the Government received from the Attorney General is that we cannot restrict citizenship for people born in Ireland without changing the Constitution. Article 2 of the Constitution makes that clear. It states: "It is the entitlement and birthright of every person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, to be part of the Irish nation." What does entitlement to be a member of the Irish nation mean unless it entitles somebody to Irish citizenship? There was a report by a lawyer in The Irish Times yesterday which disagreed with that point. I will say two things about that: first, the paper merely identified the writer as “a practising barrister” but it failed to state that he is a leading member of and former electoral candidate for Fine Gael; and, second, that I would rather rely on the advice of the Attorney General in this matter. If we want to change the current automatic entitlement to Irish citizenship for those born in Ireland, we must change the Constitution.Should Irish citizenship be automatically conferred simply as a result of a person being born here or should the Oireachtas have the power to determine the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen or is entitled to Irish citizenship? This is the key question on which the people will be asked to vote on 11 June next. That is all we have to decide. Children born in Ireland with one parent who is an Irish citizen or who is entitled to Irish citizenship will be automatically entitled to such citizenship.The law on other cases will be decided by the Oireachtas. This is the proposal of the Government. This was the position recommended by the Constitutional Review Group headed up by Dr. T.K. Whitaker when it reported in 1996 that because of its complexity, citizenship "is more appropriately dealt with in legislation" than in the Constitution. That is my position. It is easy to see why the Whitaker group made that recommendation. When one has to go into the nitty gritty of specific cases of citizenship law — as we do in our capacity as Deputies helping our constituents — then one appreciates that our citizenship law cannot be reduced to a few lines in a document, such as the Constitution, which it is itself very difficult to change or amend.If the people vote to change the Constitution, will the Government then establish an unfair situation? No, it will not. If the referendum passes and the Government's proposed legislation is passed, Ireland would still be "one of the more liberal states in the European Union from the point of view of citizenship" according to Ms Carol Coulter of The Irish Times. Ms Coulter, a person with no reason to favour particularly the Government point of view, states that, if the Government’s proposals were accepted, we would have a pretty liberal citizenship law. This is the answer to those who raise the charge of racism or to those who charge that the current referendum is racist. This issue is really very simple. Is the current law on citizenship satisfactory? I contend that it is not. Can we change the current unsatisfactory law on citizenship without changing the Constitution? No, we cannot. If the people vote to change the Constitution, will the Government then produce an unfair situation? No, it will not. The nub of the issue is whether children born in Ireland should get automatic citizenship even if neither parent has any real connection with Ireland or with the Irish people. Should Irish citizenship be automatically conferred simply as a result of a person being born here or should the Oireachtas have the power to determine the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen or is entitled to Irish citizenship?The central question is whether children born in Ireland should get automatic citizenship even if neither parent has any real connection with Ireland or with the Irish people. Should Irish citizenship be automatically conferred simply as a result of a person being born here or should the Oireachtas have the power to determine the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen or is entitled to Irish citizenship?I am sorry to say that I am not sure whether we can expect a balanced debate on this referendum. A balanced debate on this referendum would require the Opposition parties to indicate how they would deal with the problems of our citizenship law if they were in Government. There is a danger that instead of thoughtful proposals one would experience scare-mongering emotionalism peppered by unsubstantiated charges of racism. I hope we can avoid that. The Government's position is strong in logic and in facts. The Opposition is unsure how to react. So it resorts to procedural nit-picking. It is no wonder that the Opposition parties have preferred to focus on the process that has led us to this proposal than to look at the merits of the proposal itself.There have been a number of concerns raised regarding the Government's proposal. The SDLP has raised the concern that this amendment could damage the Good Friday Agreement. There are a number of answers to that concern. First, the point must be made that when the Good Friday Agreement was concluded in 1998, we did not sign up to a final settlement. We signed up to a peace process. It is ironic to hear the SDLP echo one of the core criticisms made by the DUP against the Good Friday Agreement, namely that the Agreement represents a peace process rather than a peace settlement. There have been numerous changes since the Good Friday Agreement, which have had the effect of expanding the terms of that Agreement. What was Weston Park about if not to go beyond the terms of the originally concluded Agreement? My first response to the SDLP query is that I do not accept the premise on which it is based. I do not accept that the Agreement is something fixed in stone, never to be changed or touched. The very detailed political negotiations which have taken place since the Agreement show that there are many others who share this view.Second, the Irish State operates in accordance with law. It would be unlawful for the Irish State to breach a binding international agreement such as the Good Friday Agreement. It is unthinkable that the Attorney General or his predecessor, the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, would propose legislation to this House which would involve us breaching the Good Friday Agreement.Third, the Government's proposed legislation follows exactly the detailed definition of entitlement to citizenship set out in Annexe 2 to the Good Friday Agreement. Far from breaking or threatening the Agreement, we are following its detailed provisions.Fourth, the British government has confirmed the opinion of the Irish Government that the changes we are now discussing do not conflict with the Good Friday Agreement. I put the argument to the SDLP that this referendum and the Government's proposed legislation is fully consistent with the detailed provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.A second concern that has been raised is the issue of the time required for the people to decide the question. I do not believe that the Irish people need a great deal of time to decide the question whether somebody with no prior links to Ireland should be automatically entitled to Irish citizenship just because they were born here. I do not believe that our people need a great deal of time to decide whether the Oireachtas should have the power to determine the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen or is entitled to Irish citizenship. Nor do I believe we need Green Papers or White Papers to deal with the problem.The fundamental question of automatic entitlement to citizenship is not complicated. The constitutional step we need to take to solve the problem is not complicated. It is only those who seek to avoid the question who are aiming to defer the decision. The Opposition's proposal is to kick this problem into the long grass in the hope that it will go away or fix itself. Either that, or the Opposition is unable to answer the fundamental question at the heart of this debate in an expeditious and efficient manner. I suspect that the problem for the Opposition is that there are deeply divergent opinions within the Opposition on the substantive question at issue here. The Opposition can unite in opposing the Government. The Opposition can unite in raising procedural objections or detailed questions. However, the Opposition cannot unite around its own proposal on this important matter. It can unite to disagree, to defer, to dither on the issue but it cannot unite around a single, coherent proposal. This must have been clear to the Opposition when it tabled its amendment, which portrays clearly the fundamental problem of the Opposition. While it can agree that it is against the Government, it cannot agree on what it as an alternative Government would do. While it can agree on what it is against, it cannot agree on what it is for. The Opposition can create procedural wrangles. It cannot give proposals that will work. It can raise points of order. It cannot suggest alternative proposals.

Should children born in Ireland get automatic citizenship even if neither parent has any real connection with Ireland or with the Irish people? The Oireachtas should have the power to determine the entitlement to Irish citizenship of children, neither of whose parents is an Irish citizen or is entitled to Irish citizenship. That is the reason I will vote "Yes" to the Government's proposals here in Dáil Éireann. That is why I will vote "Yes" when the question is put to the people on 11 June. That is the reason I urge support for this amendment to the Constitution.The Government is right. We have a problem with our current citizenship law. We can only fix that problem by amending the Constitution. If we amend the Constitution and pass the Government's proposed legislation, we will still have "one of the more liberal states in the European Union from the point of view of citizenship". The Opposition amendment would only delay what we know we need. The Government's proposals are sensible and reasonable. I support the Government's proposals.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	780	First, I will comment on Deputy Tim O'Malley's contribution. The Government is missing the point. Everybody agrees we should ensure there is no room for abuse of our citizenship laws. However, this is a bigger issue and is not as simple as the Minister of State suggests. Whereas the referendum on the one line amendment is a simple "yes" or "no" answer, the topic of immigration, citizenship and non-nationals is a massive issue. As I have repeatedly said in the House, we do not have a policy on this. We do not have clarity or sufficient information and that is fuelling racism. It is not that anybody wishes to fuel racism but that is what is happening as a result of the lack of information, clarity and a comprehensive policy. This is the third or fourth time I have spoken on legislation relating to immigration, non-nationals and so forth but we have never had a full debate on the subject. That is what we are seeking. Let us have a proper discussion about it and formulate a policy.The Minister said the Opposition parties cannot come forward with a set of alternatives. That is correct. Our party has not sat down to discuss this, no more than the Minister's has. There is disagreement in his party too. Nobody has discussed this fully. It is not a simple issue and it is a pity that we have to plough ahead with this referendum without having a full debate and putting all the information on the table. We are not even sure how big the problem is. We have repeatedly asked for figures on the number of children involved. How many babies have been born in the last number of years? How many parents have abused this loophole or are expected to abuse it in the future? We do not know.The Minister spoke this morning about babies being born to non-nationals in our hospitals. He never clarified, however, how many of them arrived in this country in the few days before the babies were born. A chap from America has been living near me for the past ten years. He is a non-national. If his wife has a baby, it is classified as a non-national. The baby could be included in the Minister's figures but that is not what we are discussing and it is not the reason for the referendum. Figures are being thrown about to prove the case but that is not good enough. It is creating mistrust and causing a major problem among the public.We have a problem with this referendum. We want to know the exact figures. If there is a major problem, we can work together and solve it. I am disappointed with the debate today. The arrogance is unbelievable.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-04-21 00:00:00	Prelude	782	On all sides. Members have been acting like children; nobody wants to sit down, discuss it properly and listen to the other side. The Minister turned his face away when he was being informed by Deputy Rabbitte of what people are saying about non-nationals. He did not believe Deputy Rabbitte.Perhaps people do not tell Ministers, out of respect for their office, how they feel about non-nationals. Having listened to the debate today, I believe the Government is failing to see the real picture. It does not understand the public mood. That is not to say it is out of touch but I suspect people might not be telling members of the Government what they think. A person might think: "I dare not talk to the Minister, Deputy McDowell, about racism and non-nationals because he will bury me in an argument." It would be easier to talk to me about it because I am not as great an expert. However, I can see and feel the mood. I am extremely concerned. We have a problem in this country and pushing through this amendment and debating it in an arrogant manner will not help. It will give those who wish to fuel racism a chance to do so. They will be talking in the bars and restaurants and spreading the word. We do not wish to cause this but it will happen as a by-product of our discussions this week and the referendum.There is a reason our party does not want this referendum to be held at the same time as the June election. There is a tendency among candidates and other people to talk about what non-nationals are getting or taking from this country. It is a disgrace but it is happening and candidates will tap into that. They will not put it in print or in their literature. However, they will be on the doorsteps sympathising with people whose son or daughter is waiting for a house for four years. "The other crowd got one", they will say, "but I will not let that happen". That is what will take place and that is the reason we oppose the referendum. This stems from the lack of a proper debate, no information and rushing this measure through the Houses. No wonder people are distrustful.We have a duty as public representatives to work on this issue together and to find a suitable solution. A number of people have regretted that there is not cross-party support. It certainly is a pity. This is a serious issue, at least as serious as the electronic voting issue, in terms of its importance for our future. Again, legislation on matters that are essential for the future are being shoved through without cross-party support. This debate and the lack of cross-party support could mean that the referendum could fail. We are willing to accept that there might be a problem but that has not been proven. If it proves to be a problem, we are willing to solve it by a referendum or whatever other measure is necessary.When correct information is not provided, there is an opportunity to circulate misinformation. There is a strong possibility that this referendum could fail, which would mean the issue being sidelined again. This Minister for lunacy, if I can call him that, who thought this measure should be brought forward, might fail purely because he would not work with the other parties. The huge problem he wanted to solve, therefore, will remain for another generation until somebody else attempts to solve it. It is a pity that by pushing this measure through, we will probably get nowhere with it.If it fails, will there be a rerun a few months later, as happened with the Nice treaty referendum? The Government has not learned from that referendum. The Nice treaty referendum was pushed through the first time without any proper discussion. No information was given. Everybody assumed the referendum would be passed. However, it failed and that could happen again in this referendum.The Minister said the Government's position is strong in logic and in facts. It might be strong in logic but not in facts. It is a pity we have not been given the facts. All Members said today that they hoped there would be a balanced debate but that cannot happen because we do not have the information the Minister has. How can there be a balanced debate? I would have expected to see fair play in the Houses of the Oireachtas, where everybody could be heard and where there would be proper discussions. I did not expect people to snub each other. I agree with Deputy O'Connor that it happened on all sides of the House. What happened in the House today is disgusting; I could not believe it. I could not even hear the Minister speak this morning because of all the shouting and ranting, not least from him.

However, that is not the way to deal with this emotive issue. This will cause serious problems and we will not be able to solve them. The problems associated with citizenship and non-nationals are massive but we do not appear to care. We seem to think we can block gaps here and there and make it sound good but we do not really care about the nitty gritty of what will happen in the future. It will be bad.What should be done? We need to get together with groups of people and convey the correct message to the public. We must explain what is happening and what plans we have to deal with this subject. We must talk about it in schools and elsewhere. I have been a Member of the House for nearly two years and I have mentioned this subject on a number of occasions but nobody has decided to inform people or to try to improve matters. However, when an election is due in two months it is decided to rush a Bill through the House that might appeal to people's emotions.The Government cannot blame us for thinking there is a political motive for introducing this Bill. We have not been given the reasons for it. Three months ago we asked whether there would be a referendum and were told it would not happen. A number of Deputies put down questions seeking information a month ago but they were not given answers. The Opposition cannot be blamed for thinking there is another reason for bringing this Bill before the House in such a hurry. It is a little like Chicken Licken running around saying the sky is going to fall down. The sky will not fall down if this Bill is not passed. Europe will not be annoyed with us for not pushing through this amendment. There is no major panic. We can wait a few months to discuss this properly.The Minister might not like the comparison but it is a little like George Bush rushing into Iraq without UN support. It is not as serious but the same logic applies. If George Bush had a second chance, he would probably wait for UN support before going into Iraq. Look at the problems he has now. The same applies to the Minister in this case. If he does not work with all the parties on the overall issue, not just this part of it, there will be problems. Let us watch how he will handle them. He will be back to the House, cap in hand, seeking our support after the problem has grown.Nobody has all the answers. One of our candidates seeking election in Navan is a youth worker in Dublin. She is involved in groups that work with non-nationals. Her group has never been asked its opinion on this subject. It is one of the few groups working directly with non-nationals and immigrants every day. I have friends and colleagues who work in Mosney and they have never been asked what they think.
