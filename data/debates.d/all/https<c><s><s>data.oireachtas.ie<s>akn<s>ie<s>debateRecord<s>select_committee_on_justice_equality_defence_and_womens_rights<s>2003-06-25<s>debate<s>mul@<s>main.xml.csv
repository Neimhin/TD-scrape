We had agreed to meet tomorrow morning at 9.30 a.m for Committee Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. I understand that there is a need to get Committee Stage over so that Report and Final Stages can be completed. I understand that Report and Final Stages of the Immigration Bill are scheduled to be taken on Tuesday next and those for the Intoxicating Liquor Bill on Wednesday next. What I am suggesting is that we proceed as originally agreed, from 9.30 a.m, until the Order of Business and then from 7 p.m. for a number of hours when I hope the Immigration Bill will be completed. Tomorrow morning we will complete Committee Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. Will the Minister be able to facilitate us on that?

We did not expect that we would be rushed into dealing with two major items of legislation at the end of the session. We certainly could have dealt with the Immigration Bill long ago. This was introduced in February last year. The Minister has spent a lot of time explaining, including on "Morning Ireland", the urgency of getting this legislation through, but he did not mention that the Bill was introduced in February 2002 and that there was no need for this 11th hour rush. We are prepared to co-operate, but we are certainly very disappointed and annoyed with the way the Minister managed this, giving the impression, again, that it is gamesmanship on the part of the Labour Party and others in opposition.The opposition to proceeding with the Bill in this manner came not just from me. A former Member of the Dáil, former Senator Maurice Manning, chairman of the Human Rights Commission, has also opposed it. Opposition also came from the other organisations concerned with human rights and with the issues of immigration. In this context, everybody but the Minister thinks it is rushed.Here we are getting not just one, but two Bills. It is a guillotine, with a gun being put to our heads. There are two major meetings at 7 p.m this evening that I should attend, but I have put them aside to facilitate this legislation. We will debate the Intoxicating Liquor Bill until 5.50 p.m in the Dáil today and will deal with Committee Stage at 9.30 a.m. tomorrow morning. That gives us very little time. There is no need for that.It took two years to get four interim reports from the liquor licensing commission and the strategic report of the Department of Health and Children task force, which has been sitting around for 12 months, and now, at the last minute, we are bulldozing through these two Bills. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he has put everything aside and is prepared to deal with the matter now. The rest of us have to deal with it as well. We do not have the Minister's resources in preparing Second Stage, Committee Stage or Report Stage. It is not good enough. It is not fair. We have no staff to deal with this even though there are parliamentary procedures to be dealt with, and the Minister knows them better than most. I am extremely disappointed with the way this has been done. I do not like the Minister trying to achieve one-upmanship on the Opposition in the public arena when it is he who is at fault in presenting the matter in this way. That being said, I will co-operate as much as I can in facilitating scrutiny of the legislation as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible.

I understand the resource deficit for front bench spokespersons, particularly for the front bench spokesperson on justice. The work and effort you have put in as the Labour front bench spokesperson has been enormous, without having the resources that, I hope, will be there when the new Oireachtas Commission is in place. It is a deficit that we all have to address within the Oireachtas, but I appreciate your co-operation in the timing of our meetings.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	17	This is one of the major sections of the legislation which deals with the liability of carriers. Essentially, the section proposes to transfer liability for checking documentation of people travelling to this country to carriers rather than to immigration officers. Therefore, the first line of checking the validity of documentation will now rest with the carriers of those who are seeking to disembark. We teased out the concerns to some degree yesterday, which were that carriers are not trained in immigration matters, nor do they have the expertise to function as immigration officers. The onus that is now being imposed on carriers is extraordinarily heavy because they must ensure that the documentation is presented and, thus, they will effectively fulfil the role of immigration officers.If this section is passed, many carriers who are going on day trips across the channel this summer may have to seek out an immigration officer and present all those aboard before seeking to land again on our shores. Yachting clubs should take note of those requirements.While carrier liability is being used by the Minister, and by the EU, as a tool to deal with immigration, it has the effect of stymieing the provisions of the Geneva convention. The intention of the legislation is to ensure that nobody can disembark on our shores unless every aspect of their documentation is in place but we all know that asylum seekers are unlikely to have valid documentation.I am sure the Minister was listening to "Morning Ireland" today which outlined the invidious situation in which some Irish citizens find themselves in the United States. We are talking about thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Irish citizens who are illegal aliens in the USA from where they now face deportation. They do not have the correct documentation and I am sure they are not applying for asylum. A blind eye was turned towards such people prior to 11 September 2001, but close checks are now being made on documentation by the American authorities so Irish people may find themselves being sent home on the next plane. That situation caused a hullabaloo here, yet in the case of this Bill we are not even granting the right to make an asylum application. The problem with the section is that while, in theory, we are granting protection under the Geneva convention, in practice we will not give persons the opportunity of making such an application. The Minister will have to give us a clear picture as to how asylum seekers will have an opportunity to apply for asylum here because that is what is missing from this section. There are many flaws in the manner in which the section has been formulated.Perhaps the Minister will explain how, with carrier liability in operation, genuine cases will be able to apply for asylum, properly under the Geneva convention, with an appeal mechanism to fulfil the spirit and terms of the convention. That possibility appears to be missing from this section.Section 2(9) states: "This section is without prejudice to the provisions of sections 8, 9 and 24 of the Refugee Act 1996 and to the discretion of the Minister to admit to the State a person whom the Minister considers to be in need of the protection of the State." How will that operate, however, given the caveats and precautions to ensure that someone does not land in Ireland? How will anyone be able to lodge an application for asylum, which he or she is expected to do immediately upon arrival? Where can that be done? How will a carrier be able to fulfil his or her responsibilities in a reasonable fashion? The Minister has not defined that.The onus that is now being placed on the carrier is a new one that incurs a substantial penalty. The carrier could be anybody, whether commercial or private, who arrives in this country carrying anyone with him or her. The Minister is proposing a tight system and there is no flexibility to allow for the Geneva convention to be operated fairly.

I reiterate that I am opposed to this form of carrier liability, which forces untrained airline or ferry staff into the role of immigration officers. When the onus was placed on bank officials to get people to identify themselves when opening bank accounts, they became over rigorous, and the same will happen in this case. Irish citizens wishing to open a bank account, especially those who are less well off, have encountered major difficulties since the relevant legislation was enacted. There is a tendency among those who are not trained and who are not getting paid for such work to become over rigorous. We will therefore end up with a situation in which not only will asylum seekers be put out by this provision, but Irish people also will be affected when they are returning home. If the section is passed, as currently worded, more and more refugees and asylum seekers will use unconventional means of accessing the country, rather than by plane or ferry, thus falling victim to human traffickers. We will end up with more deaths, as happened some time ago in Wexford and in the case of a Tunisian last week.This section interferes with the ability of persons at risk of persecution who are trying to gain safety. This interference would be incompatible with our international human rights and refugee protection principles. In particular, I refer to article 14 of the universal declaration, which states that each person has a right to seek asylum. If it is not possible for someone to get to the port or airport of choice to seek the right of asylum, we could be in breach of that declaration. That is also covered by articles 31 and 33 of the 1951 UN refugee convention.

We must highlight the correct documentation for asylum seekers, particularly those coming from a situation where there is considerable pressure and they may not necessarily have the correct documents. We were lucky with the outcome of the recent case in Wexford where a family with the incorrect documents was deported and the pregnant lady had a baby on board a ship. That could have ended negatively and we could have had a serious crisis on our hands. I do not accept the ethos and vision in this Bill.We must remind ourselves that we are traditionally an emigrant people. Section 2 is essential because, as Deputy Costello mentioned, on today's edition of "Morning Ireland" we heard classic examples of Irish people abroad being locked up for some weeks and then deported. I am very concerned about this section.I am not sure if the Minister has spoken to truck drivers, but I have spoken to many of them who are frightened about the liability of carriers. They feel intimidated and that the control is out of their hands. We must wake up to the reality that many people have genuine concerns both for individuals' civil liberties and for drivers, and we must highlight this.This section indicates a "fortress Ireland" policy on the part of the Government. I am very concerned that many of the views that seem to have emanated from the Immigration Control Platform have found their way into this legislation. The ethos and vision in section 2 is flawed.

A small group of people may be encouraging some Deputies to take the stance they have adopted. I believe that the great majority of Irish people know that what I am doing is sensible and correct and they support me in this. The Deputies should look at my postbag to see that I am not bluffing on this.The introduction of carrier liability within the European Union does not make immigration officials of every airline official. At the moment people travelling from Dublin to any country that has signed up to the Schengen agreement must have their documents checked. It is not possible to get on to a plane from Dublin to Paris without the appropriate documentation. The airline official will check a passenger's documentation and would be liable to French carrier liability law for not doing so. This is not draconian or inoperable - airline officials do this every day all across Europe. We would be living in a tiny isolated ideological cocoon to think otherwise. This is the norm everywhere else in Europe.It has been suggested that we are somehow in the business of driving people into the hands of people smugglers. We need to get a grip on ourselves. The vast majority of scheduled airlines and shipping lines into Ireland come from North America, Switzerland, European Union states or European Union candidate states. There may be a few scheduled flights coming from places like Moscow. Almost without exception, everybody boarding a plane to come to Ireland is in a country in which it is possible to claim refugee status. There is an air of unreality to some of the comments I am receiving as if people are standing in the middle of war torn zones, hopping on to planes going directly to Dublin. That is wholly incorrect. The great majority of people——

This applies, for instance, to the Czech Republic, which receives huge numbers of people applying for asylum. We have the odd Czech citizen coming to Ireland claiming asylum status here. People come from Canada, the US, right across Europe, Switzerland and in transit from Schipol Airport from Africa to Dublin etc. When they get on a plane to which these rules apply, in the vast majority of cases they are already in a jurisdiction where there is a highly developed refugee law and they are at liberty to make application there.Many people do not like to mention that and prefer to conduct this debate on the basis that this is not so. However, it is the case. This applies equally to sailings from Roscoff and Cherbourg to Ireland. France is a country with a highly developed refugee law of its own. There seems to be a notion creeping into general discourse - and it is not so - that there is a right under international law to choose any country in the world and to travel through any country with the intention of making an application in a particular desired country. It is believed that those in fear of persecution can go to whatever country they want. That is not international law or practice and it is not what the Geneva Convention is about.This law generally applies to people coming to Ireland from the continent of Europe and on North American flights. I accept that occasional flights come from Moscow, Cuba and a few other places. Generally we are talking about carriers transporting people for reward from places where they already have the right to claim asylum. I therefore reject the notion that this is inconsistent with our obligations under the 1951 convention. Every other European Union member state has carrier liability law and it is unrealistic to say that Ireland, for some reason of international law, should not do what every other member state of the European Union does and what we would be absolutely obliged to do if we joined the Schengen system. Let us get real in this debate.It has also been suggested repeatedly that the effect of this would be to drive people into the hands of smugglers and traffickers and that this will endanger people. I repeat, a person who is trafficking anybody to Ireland is almost, without exception and with mathematical certainty, transporting them through countries in which they could claim asylum. If you are in a container, you are not coming from South America. That is the situation.This notion that under this regime people who are required to produce documents to travel on scheduled air flights and scheduled sailings to Ireland are somehow being denied their rights and being driven into the hands of people smugglers is very difficult. It should be borne in mind that the overall effect of this Bill will make it a lot more difficult for people smugglers to ply their trade. I say that because the other provisions in this Bill which demonstrate that Ireland is getting serious about gross abuses of our system will make it a lot more difficult for people smugglers to persuade people in the countries of origin that they have a significant chance of abusing our system of asylum. That is what really drives the human trafficking trade, that they can hold out the realistic vision to people that they can fix it for them to get to Ireland as an economic migrant. They say to someone in a disadvantaged country: "Give us a bundle of cash and we will get you into the Irish State - when you get there, they have such an elaborate system that you will be there for months and years and you will not be sent back."The prospect of success is what keeps the traffickers going and what makes it realistic for them to ask for &dollar;5,000 from the most disadvantaged people across the world. It is the prospect that they can dress up economic migrancy with an application for asylum in Ireland. That is what drives the whole process. If the Deputies opposite are worried about diminishing the trade in human trafficking and diminishing the smugglers' capacity to get money from people and put them into these horrific situations, the best way to proceed is to make our laws work effectively because the message will then go back very quickly that it is not worth giving &dollar;3,000 or &dollar;5,000 to the Mafia-type people to get to Ireland because the system there very quickly sorts out the economic migrants from the refugees and that it is a waste of money trying to cod the Irish Government.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The Minister also has a little problem with the real world. The organisations with responsibility for dealing with these issues have been saying the same things as we have been saying in this committee. Yesterday, we were given a briefing document on this Bill from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. It was handed in at the gate of Leinster House and it proved very difficult to deliver it, as we saw. Its assessment of the legislation is not the same as the Minister's assessment. The report states:While carrier sanctions may be a legitimate immigration tool, such measures may also interfere with the ability of persons at risk of persecution to gain access to safety. If states have recourse to carrier sanctions, they should be implemented in a manner which is consistent with international human rights and refugee protection principles. Notably, Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to which each person has the right to seek asylum and Article 31 - refugees unlawfully in the country of refuge, Article 33 prohibition of expulsion or return referral of the 1951 convention. Therefore, liability of carriers should not apply in respect of bona fide asylum seekers/persons in need of international protection. Carrier liability legislation without this exemption will only drive asylum seekers/refugees into the hands of smugglers and traffickers as has happened in other states.That is the considered opinion of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter. Unless provision is made for bona fide applicants, asylum seekers will be turned over to smugglers and traffickers, as has happened in other states. The Minister is arguing the opposite, saying that because we have strict regulations, the traffickers will not be allowed get a grip on the market. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says that this is what has already happened in the other countries in which it has been implemented.There is a contradiction between what the people say who are charged with dealing with refugees and their applications and what the Minister says. I ask the Minister where is the provision in this section for the bona fide asylum seeker to make an application. The Minister has framed this legislation in such a way that unless the bona fide asylum seeker has valid documentation, he or she cannot make an application. Under the Geneva Convention, a bona fide asylum seeker does not by definition have to possess authentic documentation. It is accepted that he or she may not have a valid passport or visa in all instances and, in the majority of cases, that will be the case. We are caught in a bind.It is ironic that only a few years ago on the economic refugee side of the coin, every politician pleaded a case for the Irish illegal economic refugees in the United States. I recall a legendary occasion when a well known Fianna Fáil Senator in County Kerry hired an aircraft to take to the United States bundles of applications for one of the green card amnesties which had been granted to the Irish diaspora of economic refugees. There is that hypocrisy at the heart of our attitude towards asylum seekers and economic refugees. We have the greatest diaspora of all illegal aliens throughout the world and now we are introducing legislation that will not allow an economic refugee or an asylum seeker who is genuinely fleeing persecution to have the opportunity to put in a claim. I have a difficulty with that.The Minister admitted here yesterday that this legislation will not deal with 70% of the illegal non-nationals who are coming to this country, presumably because they are coming via the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland. This legislation will not deal with those coming through our nearest neighbouring country and on to us. It is our duty to tease out this legislation and we need time to look at it. We would all have benefited from more time to have proper consultation with those organisations that have specific responsibility in this matter.I do not accept the Minister's analysis that people seeking asylum will turn away from traffickers - in other words, the effect of the legislation will undermine the work of traffickers once standard access points to a country are totally closed off. As Deputy Finian McGrath said, it is a case of fortress Ireland. The Minister will turn everyone seeking asylum into the hands of traffickers. We saw the terrible tragedy off the Tunisian coast where asylum seekers were heading for Italy and we will see more of these tragedies - that is, essentially, what the UN High Commissioner has stated in response to the Minister's carrier liability legislation. She was not talking about anybody else but exclusively about the Minister.

The history of Europe is that most countries in the European Union have had, and still have, imperial interests. Many refugees will not apply for asylum in those European countries because the Governments which persecuted, and continue to persecute, them have interests in and the support of those countries. Such people usually move on from those countries.The Minister mentioned Romania which will be a member of the European Union in a few years' time. It would be strange for us to take a hard stance against countries which will become members of the European Union from April of next year and those who will become members in April 2007.The best way to tackle the trafficking of humans is to redistribute the wealth of the world and to address poverty rather than close borders and prevent people from arriving in a country as economic migrants or from seeking asylum in the European Union. Yesterday, I mentioned the number of people who have died since 2002 trying to reach European shores, and I excluded the most recent figures. The figure is over 3,500. Despite what the Minister has said, if this legislation is implemented and even if it is similar to that in other European countries, we will contribute to an increase in the number of deaths among those trying to reach fortress Europe. That the rest of the European Union has adopted this does not make it right. We have an opportunity to stand out and not to pass this type of carrier liability provision. This country is not party to the Schengen agreement nor is it likely to be in the foreseeable future, although the rest of Europe might be.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	54	In regard to the Minister's points and the question of immigrants and economic migrants, if one looks closely at this Bill and has listened to the discussion this morning, one will know this legislation will not stop economic migrants. The Minister and many people are living under the illusion that people will stop moving around because of this legislation. The reality is that poor people will always move to rich countries. In the 1940s and 1950s, half of our relations went to America and to England because of unemployment and the economic situation. There will always be economic migrants moving from poor countries to wealthy ones. If one listens and talks to these people, which I have done over the past seven or eight years, one will realise that.As a democrat, I accept the Minister's point that his position might be popular among the wider public and that his views might be supported. Sometimes our position might not be popular and it is difficult to be supportive of people from different countries, immigrants and non-nationals. Over the past couple of years I have been abused and have received hate mail and all sorts of letters. The Minister can check with the gardaí in Raheny some of the threats I have received because I stuck my head on the block on this issue. I accept it is not trendy or fashionable to do so and we have been hammered many a time. I commend Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Costello for their leadership on the issue which, at times, is difficult.On the positive side, I had the honour of working in a small inner city school where 15% of children were immigrants. They were like the Irish who went to America or to England in that they really worked hard. In the morning I enjoyed seeing different nationalities come into the yard in their Dublin Bus uniforms to drop off their children. That was the positive side of immigration. We sometimes forget that many people have come to our country and have made a massive economic contribution. Although we are discussing this Bill and carrier liability, I would like that message to be sent. Immigration does not always mean bad news. As leaders and as politicians, we have a duty to sell that message to the public.
#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	55	The provisions of section 2 are strongly worded and are necessary. I do not concur with the view that the penalties on carriers will encourage traffickers. It will discourage them. I attended a conference in Stockholm two or three years ago and listened to its proceedings with great interest. At that stage we had the second highest number of immigrants per capita in the EU outside of Belgium, and I wonder if that ratio still stands.Over half of my siblings are living in the United States and it always bugs me to hear people talk about how easy it was to go there. My sisters went out there when I was a baby. They were finger printed and had to have a place to stay before they could sign on. They jumped through hoops to get there and stay there. This notion that the Irish were welcomed with open arms and that it was easy for them is false. We must have regulations like finger printing. We must have protections here. I am not being in any way racist or narrow-minded in this regard but for too long we have heard about human trafficking in Europe and beyond, and there are well developed gangs, some with Chinese connections, who are into trafficking and racketeering.We must not give the impression, which we have done in the past four or five years, that Ireland is a soft touch. Genuine asylum seekers fleeing persecution need protection, but the economic migrants who come here must be aware that we have stringent laws and regulations. This section is tough, but we need it.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I want to focus again on how, when this legislation, particularly this section, is implemented, somebody who is genuinely in need of succour or security from this State will be able to receive it. I ask how that will operate with the restrictions that are being put in place in relation to carrier liability. In the broader context of what we have been discussing, the Minister might also address the whole question of an immigration policy. We really have not discussed that but it fits into this context. It is one thing to put in regulations and provisions of this nature, but it is another thing to have a policy and a plan as to how we should deal with immigration.We should have some philosophical underpinning which recognises that there are many economic refugees out there who have heard about Ireland's economic success, and we should look at whether a quota or green card system could be provided in that respect rather than the sort of bonded employer system we have established for migrant workers coming here. We have very stringent provisions here in relation to carrier liability. On the other hand, we have very limited and improper provisions in relation to people who we accept as workers in areas with a surplus of employment requirements. The Minister might make some reference to the broader issue, whether he has plans to deal with this issue in the broader context. Specifically, I ask him how anybody will be able to make an application considering the strict curtailment that will be provided under this carrier liability legislation.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Perhaps I can agree with Deputy McGrath in his final observations. I believe in a society which welcomes immigrants who come to participate in our economic life in accordance with some orderly process. I believe in a multi-ethnic society. I believe that we should not have discriminatory immigration laws. I agree with Deputies Costello and McGrath that our immigration law should be developed to an extent which it is not at present. I agree with them both that the notion that one gets into Ireland simply on the basis of a relationship with one employer, while pragmatic in one sense, is deficient in other respects.If we need a carpenter in this country, why should a carpenter not come here regardless of whether he or she has an engagement with a specific employer, and why should his or her status be linked to a specific employer? That is a very good argument but it is not what we are dealing with here. I have made this point so many times that I have given up and am blue in the face making it, but if one looks at people who are obviously foreign in ethnic origin on any street, the great majority of them are not asylum seekers and never have been, have nothing to do with the asylum process, are here perfectly lawfully at our invitation and are making a very valuable contribution to our society. That point has to be impressed upon the Irish people.I have no problem with any of those propositions, and I think we all agree on them. However, the phrase "economic refugees" was creeping into Deputy Costello's argument, and I do not agree with the notion that this is all part of one continuum. Asylum seeking is specific and different. We all know that asylum seeking is used as a route for economic migrancy, but the State's attitude to asylum seekers has to be qualitatively different from its attitude to would-be immigrants. With would-be immigrants, the State effectively asks whether is has a place for them and whether they have some useful role to play. With asylum seeking, those issues do not arise. It involves a person saying that he or she is in fear of persecution, is claiming our protection and wishes to be accommodated and allowed into our society while we consider the issue.This is wholly separate from a tradesman, carpenter or somebody working in McDonalds wanting to come here to flee economic deprivation. It is a totally different system. I fully appreciate that many people use one to achieve the other, and it would be naive of me to pretend otherwise. Legally speaking, I cannot operate an asylum seeking law on the basis that it is open to abuse. I cannot do that, and it would be madness to allow me to do so. If that were the law here, people who are willing to deceive the State as to their circumstances would go to the top of the queue whereas people who are willing to offer their skills and go through whatever immigration regime we have would go to the bottom of the queue. We simply cannot operate that way.I fully take the points that the Deputies opposite are making about how Irish people relied on migration in the past. I agree completely that economic migration, as a phenomenon, will increase rather than decrease. The notion that we will all live in a purely lace curtained, pale skinned Ireland of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s is simply not on. The Immigration Control Platform may be disappointed to hear me say that, but it is simply not on. We are moving towards a multi-ethnic society. However, no ideological attachment to multi-ethnicity and fairness in the international economic order should confuse us into having an asylum seeking law which will effectively just be a bolt-hole through which everybody walks, talking about asylum until they get established here and then, as is the case, simply abandoning their application, disappearing into the work and announcing that they have achieved their aim and do not want to claim the protection of the Irish State anymore.I must have a workable law and workable system of immigration controls. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings of the European Union, my Swedish colleague, who has very strong views on these subjects, constantly emphasises that Europe needs migrants, that Sweden in particular badly needs migrant workers for the purposes of the European economy. He constantly puts that point to us. We are moving towards a European Union where migration law and policy will be considered at a European level and where we will probably surrender a good deal of our capacity to exercise a veto. The unanimity requirement will disappear in relation to asylum seeking as well. We are moving towards a situation where Europe will have to make collective decisions on these fronts. In the meantime Ireland is entitled to have laws, procedures and protections that work and to ask of carriers providing services to this country that they behave in the same way as they do when going elsewhere.With regard to the point about the UN commissioner's observations, which must be answered, if one said that carrier liability applies except where somebody claims to be coming here as an asylum seeker, that would make a complete mess of any system requiring people to be documented. No one in his or her right mind would bother arguing the toss with an airline official in Le Bourget or anywhere else if all he or she had to say were the magic words "I am travelling to Ireland as an asylum seeker", the issue of documentation were to be put to oneself and the official were merely to look at the colour of the person's money and put him or her on a plane. That could not be the law. With respect to the UN High Commissioner, no other member state of the European Union has accepted the argument that one can simply present oneself at a counter anywhere in the world and say "I am flying to Ireland as an asylum seeker; I do not propose to produce documentation." We cannot have a law of that kind. The UN has not persuaded any of our fellow member states in the European Union that that is a reasonable law and I do not propose to introduce such a law.

In page 5, subsection (1)(b), line 32, to delete “at the Garda Síochána station” and substitute “or an authorised person at a Garda Síochána station or at another place”.These amendments address the means whereby carriers who are notified of an alleged offence under section 2 can pay a fixed penalty and thus avoid the need for the matter to go to court. Section 3 states that such a penalty is to be paid to a specified member of the Garda Síochána at a designated station. This arrangement is too inflexible and I intend that the fine can be paid in offices other than Garda stations - I refer in particular to the offices at Burgh Quay in Dublin, which house the headquarters of the Garda National Immigration Bureau as well as the immigration and asylum divisions of my Department. These offices do not comprise a Garda station. It may also be necessary to provide further collection facilities at other sites and ports, which may not necessarily be Garda stations. These more flexible arrangements, which are directly analogous to amendments to the Road Traffic Act 1994, for similar arrangements for parking and other offences, will be in ease of the carrier that incurs a fine and will also make for a more efficient use of resources in respect of immigration.One of the inflexibilities that existed under the Road Traffic Act was that all on-the-spot fines had to be paid to members of the Garda Síochána. The Government is anxious, as am I, to have flexible arrangements so people within or without the public service can do work that is not essential to the Garda, such as fine collecting and paperwork.

What does this mean in practice? If a carrier does not present himself to an immigration officer, does it mean that there will be an investigative procedure in place that will include other places and Garda stations? Will the system be centralised in some form? How will the Minister achieve the objective of giving to immigration officers an active role in searching for people who might be in breach of carrier liability legislation? Obviously this role did not exist before because there was no carrier liability resulting in carriers having to go to a Garda station or another place and pay a fine of €1,500.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	63	This is the equivalent in immigration law of the on-the-spot fine that applied in road traffic law. Where a garda detects a person speeding, as defined in road traffic law, he serves a notice on the person in question at his or her registered address. This notice compels the person who was detected speeding to accept that there was an infringement of the law and to pay a penalty or face the proposition that he or she be brought to court. In effect, this is an on-the-spot fine procedure.The amendments the Government is proposing are to allow processing and administration of on-the-spot fines procedures to be carried out in a more flexible way. It used to be the case that they had to be processed only by a member of the Garda Síochána, but this meant that gardaí had to receive fines, account for them, issue documentation and receipts in respect of them and make these available to their superiors, thus consuming an immense amount of Garda time. As I said in respect of this matter, one possibility is to use Burgh Quay where there is a very substantial facility. I ask members of the committee to visit it because it is an eye-opener.Deputy Costello should note that it is my intention to transfer the task of handling fines from the gardaí to established agencies or, alternatively, to give contracts to companies outside the public service to handle and process them.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Section 2 imposes carrier liability and section 3 concerns the sanctions imposed if an immigration officer has reasonable grounds that a carrier is alleged to have committed an offence. The legislation is flimsy in respect of the on-the-spot fine. It is transferring the onus to the carrier from the immigration officer, implying that the carrier will incur a substantial on-the-spot fine of €1,500 which must be paid within 28 days.I object to this section because I objected to the implications in the previous one. It is wrong that the carrier should now, out of the blue, be given the specific responsibility conferred under the Bill. There is no reference to how the carrier will fulfil this responsibility and no reference to training. They must ascertain the authenticity of documents. Documents can be very complicated and, as we all know from what we heard last night in the Dáil, many people forge them. While this might be a defence on the part of a carrier he is, nevertheless, responsible for ensuring that documents are valid. A new offence is being created and the carrier will be responsible for immigration policy and for who comes and who does not come into this country. That is very unfair. It is put in a very flimsy fashion in section 3 which states that where an immigration officer has reasonable grounds for believing an offence has been committed, he or she must give notice that the person is alleged to have committed the offence and so on. That section should be opposed as well and we should not go down that road.

In page 6, before section 4, to insert the following new section:"4.-The Aliens Act 1935 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 7:'7.-(1) Where, on the sworn information of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant, a judge of the District Court is satisfied that -(a) it is reasonably necessary for the purpose of the enforcement of -(i) an aliens order, or(ii) an order under section 3 or 4 of the Immigration Act 1999 ("the Act of 1999"),that a place specified in the information should be searched by members of the Garda Síochána, or(b) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidence of or relating to an offence under section 6 or section 3, 4 or 8 of the Act of 1999 is to be found at a place specified in the information,the judge may issue a warrant for the search of that place and any persons found at that place.(2) A warrant issued under this section shall authorise a named member of the Garda Síochána, alone or accompanied by such other members of the Garda Síochána and such other persons as may be necessary-(a) to enter, within 7 days from the date of the warrant, and if necessary by the use of reasonable force, the place named in the warrant,(b) to search it and any persons found there, and(c) to seize anything found there, or anything found in the possession of a person present there at the time of the search, which that member reasonably believes to be evidence of or relating to an offence under section 6 or section 3, 4 or 8 of the Act of 1999.(3) A member of the Garda Síochána acting in accordance with a warrant issued under this section may require any person found at the place where the search is carried out to give the member his or her name and address.(4) Any person who-(a) obstructs or attempts to obstruct any member of the Garda Síochána acting in accordance with a warrant issued under subsection (1),(b) fails or refuses to comply with a requirement under this section, or(c) gives a name or address which is false or misleading,shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.(5) A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant any person whom the member suspects of having committed an offence under subsection (4).(6) In this section, "place" includes any dwelling, any building or part of a building and any vehicle, vessel, structure or container used or intended to be used for the carriage of goods by road.'.".Section 4, as it stands, concerns the non-employment of non-nationals in the State without proper authority. It was introduced on the basis that at the time the Bill was published, it was anticipated that the Tánaiste would not be in a position to put her major legislation, which was to contain this section, on the Statute Book in the foreseeable future. It was to implement that one aspect of legislation which she proposed in any event. As things have turned out, she has overtaken us. As the Tánaiste introduced law to this effect, this is now, effectively, redundant. This amendment involves the deletion of section 4 and the insertion of the new section.The new section is to modernise the law provided in the Aliens Act 1935 in relation to entry, search and seizure. The purpose of this amendment is to modernise the powers of search in section 7 of the Aliens Act 1935 and to extend those powers for the purposes of the enforcement of deportation orders under the Immigration Act 1999. This amendment will also have the effect of removing from the Bill the present section 4. That provision has been superseded by the passage of the Employment Permits Act 2003 earlier this year which includes provisions modelled on the one being dropped from the Bill.Search powers under section 7 of the Aliens Act 1935 apply in respect of breaches of an aliens order or an order made under an aliens order. This includes such matters as illegal entry into the State, breach of conditions of stay, failure to register with the local aliens office and the like. Until the recent passage of the Employment Permits Bill, these were the only powers of search and entry available for detection of breaches of employment permits. That legislation now contains its own provisions in this regard.The 1935 Act search powers also applied where a breach of a deportation order was being investigated since deportation orders were "orders made under an Aliens Order" which is the Aliens Order of 1946. However, these orders are now being made under the Immigration Act 1999 an Act which does not contain its own search and entry provisions and this amendment remedies that.The provision in the amendment is modelled on that in section 7 of the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000, and avoids archaic and, let it be said, draconian language of the 1935 original. For instance, the power to "integrate [a phrase used constantly in the 1930s] . . . . . . . all persons found in such place" in the 1935 Act is ameliorated in the Government's proposal to a power to ask a person's name and address. In the same vein, the text in the amendment is informed by the concept of "reasonableness", a word which does not appear in the 1935 provision in any context. I recommend this amendment to the committee.

The Minister proposes new powers of entry, search and seizure for the purposes of the Aliens Act 1935. There are already extensive powers of search and seizure in the 2000 Act. Why are we creating new powers without repealing the old ones? Will the Minister elaborate on that? In what way did he think the existing powers were deficient? Surely we should have a single set of powers of entry, arrest and seizure. It seems the Minister is establishing a parallel set of powers to the existing ones which I thought were fairly extensive.

The amendment refers to a Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant. Is that too low a grade or is it common practice in other such cases? The amendment also refers to members of the Garda Síochána and such other persons as may be necessary. Will the Minister explain why that is so broad? The amendment also states that a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant any person whom the member suspects of having committed an offence under subsection (4). Section 4 of the Bill, as it stands, states "whom the member reasonably suspects of having committed an offence". Is there a reason the word "reasonably" has been deleted?

That is a good improvement to the text. There is some law to the effect——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	82	In regard to the other three amendments to the amendment, Deputy Costello's amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 18 would have the rather odd result that the search and entry powers specified in the Aliens Act 1935 would be unavailable to deal with the bulk of offences which arise under that Act. By excluding section 6 of that Act, or the offence of breaching an Aliens Order made under the Act, from the scope of the new provision, the Deputy's amendment would seriously emasculate that Act and any orders made under it. I do not, therefore propose to accept it.Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 to amendment No. 18 have the purpose of replacing the search and entry powers in the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 with this provision. I fully see where the Deputy is coming from as they are similar and parallel provisions. In fact, one is virtually the same as the other. However, I want to keep the integrity of the two Acts so that if somebody lifts the 2000 Act off a shelf, they will be able to see what the powers under that Act actually are. Likewise, when somebody lifts up the Immigration Bill, they will be able to see what the powers of enforcement actually are.The Deputy is suggesting that since they are similar powers, they could apply from one Act across to another but I would prefer to leave the text on both Acts so that somebody who picks up either Act, especially lawyers and people acting on behalf of immigrants, will have a clear statement of what the law is in the code they are dealing with rather than having to go off and get a different book off a different shelf to find out what was happening to their client. I accept Deputy Costello's amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 18 but I am opposed to the others.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I spoke about the principal amendment. It is designed to update - I am sorry, I should have answered a number of questions. Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about the selection of the rank of sergeant. That is also provided for in the 2000 Act. It is designed to ensure that somebody of experience within the Garda Síochána makes the application to the District Court judge. There are other provisions under, say, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1984 and the Offences Against the State Act 1939 whereby Garda officers can issue warrants on their own account. This warrant must be granted by a District Court judge.In case anybody has any misunderstanding about this, I fully accept that the dwelling of the individual in particular must be protected and that we cannot have members of the Garda Síochána free simply to knock on any door they like and carry out searches when the thought occurs to them. We must have judicial control. There was a time, when I was starting off in law, when warrants seemed to be issued on an automatic basis, but there has been a lot of jurisprudence since from the superior courts saying that this is a serious power and that there must be an evidential basis for it and that the judge must bear in mind the conflicting constitutional rights before issuing a warrant in these circumstances.One is interfering with somebody's privacy, their home life and their right under the Constitution to have their dwelling inviolable except in accordance with law. These are weighty matters and the District Court Judiciary are asked to adjudicate on them as the independent judicial arm of the State because they have to carry out a balancing exercise as to whether what they are being told by the Garda is proportionate bearing in mind the inconvenience of the compulsory powers that are being given to search places.

I ask the Minister for further clarification on my amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 18. I am proposing to delete "section 6 or" from the proposed new section 7(1)(b) of the Aliens Act 1935. Section 6 of the Act does not seem to create any offence, so why should there be entitlement——

Amendment No. 18 provides for the insertion of a new section 7 in the Aliens Act 1935. The reference to section 6 is not to section 6 of this Bill but to section 6 of the other Bill. I am sorry if that is not clear. We are inserting a new section 7 in the Aliens Act 1935; that Act is being amended by the substitution of a new section 7. The reference in the amendment to section 6 is a reference to section 6 of the Aliens Act 1935, not a reference to section 6 of this Bill.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	93	——to the effect that no offence was created and, therefore, such powers should not be given in respect of that section.I accept the Minister's argument in relation to my amendment. It is useful to have parallel powers without repealing the existing powers in order that one can see exactly what is in the legislation. However, an argument could also be made that there should be a consolidation of powers, which is probably the proper logical and legal way to proceed, although in practical terms it is useful to have the powers granted outlined in the legislation.Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked about a warrant being issued by the District Court. This relates to the new section 7(1) of the Aliens Act which provides that "Where, on the sworn information of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant, . . . ". Is it still the case that warrants sought, even in the courts, are issued in a fairly automatic fashion? There are hardly any instances of warrants sought being refused. We have a different approach to this area in this jurisdiction compared to, say, the United States where such cases are heard and there is a much closer scrutiny of information supplied and the reasons given. I recall tabling a question to the Minister seeking statistics on the number of warrants sought, refused and granted, to which I believe I still have not received a reply. I believe there would be a great disproportion if we were to consider the number refused and the number granted. It seems that in virtually all cases warrants are granted. Even though there appears to be strong protective measures in this legislation, the practice is that a Garda officer brings an application for a warrant to the District Court, the District Court judge takes a preliminary glance at it and a warrant is granted. Would the Minister care to comment on that?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	94	There was a time in the past when sworn information was handed to a peace commissioner and it was almost automatic that it was stamped. People had a suspicion that it was not carefully read, but that has changed. District Court judges carefully read the sworn information before them and check whether there is a prima facie case for the granting of a warrant. In regard to all these matters, one must remember that there is, what the lawyers call, an ex parte process; there is not another side to contradict matters. In such cases, one is under oath - it would be serious to lie under oath - and sets out a prima facie basis for the rights of another person in respect of his or her privacy and home to be interfered with. I know from latter experience that District Court judges regularly ask some searching questions of gardaí seeking warrants and if they feel they are being taken for granted, they ask questions checking the basis for particular assertions in the sworn information on which the warrant is granted.We cannot have an adversarial system under which a person whose house is about to be raided is notified and where such a person can go to court and argue against such a search. That would not be practical. Perhaps in an ideal world there should be a scrutineer in court who would act as an adversary and check through all these matters, but that is not the way we have done business heretofore, although maybe in the future we will go down that road.

Given that in relation to this new section we are talking about a member of the force not below the rank of sergeant, a warrant could be issued and a Garda of no rank could prosecute the warrant for which the Garda sergeant applied in the first instance.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The Minister referred to the way we have operated the system hitherto. It is a substantial power to give people the right to enter, seize and search a person's home. Perhaps we should reconsider this system, given that there is no due process in terms of the seeking of warrants. We hear from time to time of the wrong home being raided and considerable damage being done in terms of breaking down doors and carrying out the search. If we are going to allow persons access to people's homes without the opportunity of questioning the validity of the information given, it would be no harm to do research on how the warrant system has operated to date. We should check the percentage of warrants refused and granted, whether we are satisfied that a garda not below the rank of sergeant can walk into the District Court to seek a warrant and 99% of the time walk out with one, and how it will be effected immediately afterwards. As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, who will effect it at that point? What rank of officer will be responsible for the entry into a person's home? Such an officer will have wide ranging powers to interfere in a family home, to seize goods and to search at will. That is an extraordinary power granted in an extremely flimsy fashion.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I agree with Deputy Costello that it would be disturbing if we thought the granting of such warrants was a quasi-automatic process, but my impression is that is no longer, if it ever was, the case. District Court judges question gardaí and do not allow themselves to be taken for granted. Sometimes they ask a fairly cursory question such as "are you sure?" but, by definition, sometimes a compelling case has been sworn up to by the garda, and that is the situation in which they find themselves.Two things occurred to me in respect of the question of "other persons", to which Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred. First, if one was going to enter a house to arrest a person, one could find oneself having to look after children in that house - this sometimes happens. One could find oneself searching a house in which there are children but no adults or, alternatively, one might have to put the children into care before conducting an extensive search. Second, when I was Attorney General an issue arose regarding accompanying persons. If someone was suspected of breaching the Act in a flagrant, orchestrated manner, one might have to analyse the data or e-mails saved on his computer, which might require experts other than the local gardaí. This is why "other persons" can be authorised in such cases.

If one is in a hurry, they may not be available. The role of peace commissioners has largely contracted from the role originally envisaged when the post was established. They were a variant of justices of the peace under British rule and we established the role of peace commissioner in the 1920s. It is amazing how many people want to be peace commissioners.

In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:"(a) in section 2, by the substitution of the following paragraph for paragraphs (c), (d) and (e):'(c) there are serious grounds for considering that he or she-(i) has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes,(ii) has committed a serious non-political crime outside the State prior to his or her arrival in the State, or(iii) has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.',".
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	121	For the information of Deputies, amendment No. 22 is amendment No. 6 in the Explanatory Memorandum provided. Its purpose is to reflect more closely in the Irish statutory definition of "refugee" the language of the Geneva convention as regards the exclusion clauses in Article 1F of that convention. That article excludes from refugee status any person where there are serious reasons for believing that he or she has committed war crimes, serious non-political crimes or acts contrary to the principles of the United Nations.The requirement that regard has to be had to serious reasons in respect of these serious matters does not appear in the current section 2. Undoubtedly, such serious reasons are very important in the assessment of the application of the exclusion provisions and should be reflected in Irish law. This amendment achieves that. If it were not made, the protection against war criminals would probably require that there be a conviction before we could withhold protections. This would be entirely impractical.

Some evidence should be produced or some requirement met for considering a person to be suspect under this section rather than a mere statement that there are serious grounds for doing so. It would, effectively, tighten it up.I agree certain people should be excluded, namely, people guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Given the recent conflict in Iraq, would the Prime Minister of Britain and the President of the United States be found to be somewhat in breach of section 6(c)(iii) which reads, “guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations”. If it transpires there are no weapons of mass destruction, will these people be guilty of war crimes? I would not like the Prime Minister of Britain or the President of the United States to be refused access to this country but if any decision was to be made on the matter, it would be best——

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	125	At present the law is unsatisfactory. This introduces the notion that an individual can be refused refugee status if there are "serious grounds for believing". One could bring it one stage further and state, "where it has been determined". "Serious grounds for believing" is subject to judicial review, In other words, if I, as Minister, refuse an individual asylum status or whatever on serious grounds, there could be a judicial review of me if there were not serious grounds. If it stated, "it has been determined", one would give the Judiciary the right to review the decision on the matter. If that was the case, one would have to have a hearing under natural law principles and under the European Convention on Human Rights. Both sides would have to be heard and it would, effectively, turn the Minister into a mini-tribunal as to whether the individual was or was not guilty of war crimes or whatever the case may be.The present law, which is the type the United Nations would favour, is the most workable. I do not want to put myself in a position where I have to accept people into this country and then set out elaborate hearings and procedures in which both sides of the case are put to me. It is better for us to have a system in which an individual can be refused and in which the only basis he or she can challenge the refusal is that it was not done on serious grounds, whatever the rights and wrongs of it, and that he or she does not have to be adjudicated to be war criminals or whatever. The threshold should be that there exists serious grounds for believing that he or she is a war criminal. The decision as to whether those serious grounds are right or wrong should be a matter for the Government of Ireland through its executive agencies to address rather than have a hearing in the High Court as to whether an individual really is, or is not, a war criminal or whatever. That would make the system almost unworkable.

I understand what the Minister is saying - that he does not want to get involved in a major judicial process on this matter. However, what is stated here is quite vague. The Minister will exclude an individual from the benefits of the Refugee Act because there are serious grounds for considering that he or she has committed a crime. If there are serious grounds for considering he or she has committed a crime, there are questions to be answered but who asks the questions and how does one get the answers?

Is that what he is asking? If there are serious grounds, there must be a process for questioning the individual making the application. If the individual gives satisfactory answers, then he or she is not guilty of war crimes. If one leaves it in a limbo, one is not solving the problem. The only way out of the Minister's dilemma is to accept sole discretion and I do not believe that is a satisfactory response to the issue.The wording creates great uncertainty. The Minister must have something further to offer the individual where there are grounds for considering he or she is guilty of committing a crime. There must be a process to enable questions to be asked and to be answered. If we do not provide such a process, how will a determination be made because it must be made at some stage?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The language is taken directly from the convention and it states, "The provisions in this convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious grounds for considering that: . . . . .". I am using the language of the convention. I stress the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner would generally deal with this issue. However, I do not want a determination to be made by that body that an individual is a war criminal. I do not want it to be said that it is exercising a criminal law function, that it is deciding that an individual before it is a war criminal and that that is the basis on which it operates. I want a different threshold which is simply that provided in the convention, that is, there are serious grounds for believing, otherwise the lawyers would run a coach and four through this and state that it does not actually apply unless one establishes objectively - on the basis of objective fact - that certain matters are so.For example, if an individual comes from the Balkans and it is written in all the newspapers that he or she has done certain things and if one had to determine the issue on natural justice principles to prove it, one would have to bring in victims and witnesses and so on. I want to leave it simply that there are serious grounds for believing certain things and whether they are right or wrong, we can say no. I accept it is less certain but if an individual came from Bosnia or the former Yugoslavian Federation, presented himself or herself in Dublin claiming refugee status and if the world and his wife knew he or she was being sought by various people, for us to undertake the onus of proof that certain things were true would make us a laughing stock.

In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:"(a) in section 6, by the addition of the following subsection:'(4) The Commissioner and the Tribunal shall, if they or either of them reject an application for refugee status, and if so requested by the applicant, make a recommendation to the Minister on whether or not protection should be afforded to the applicant by way of humanitarian leave to remain in the State.'.".This is self-explanatory and I would appreciate if the Minister would accept it.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I am not of a mind to accept it. The commissioner and the tribunal have a function to carry out under statute. It may well be that one of them could decide to put pen to paper and write a letter to me saying that, in the course of a hearing, they discovered (a), (b) and (c). There is nothing stopping them from doing that. I do not want to fudge the issues here. They are there to determine issues under the asylum law.If they have a function in relation to humanitarian matters as of right, their hearings will be conducted with a view to obtaining one of those recommendations. Therefore, all sorts of things will enter into the equation, such as family circumstances and so on - the kind of things I consider on a regular basis. I want to make it clear to the Refugee Applications Commissioner and to the tribunal that their function is to run hearings and decide on the legalities of the issue.If there are humanitarian issues of which they become aware, there is no reason they should not communicate with anybody in the process and draw that to their attention. If I go down the other road, every hearing before them will be conducted with a view to getting one of those recommendations. Thus, every extraneous issue, such as the person's disadvantaged background or the loss of the family pet, will be thrown into the case and everything that could possibly affect me will be included in both the first and second instance in order to try to get such a recommendation. This will broaden and slow things down massively.In case that sounds harsh, it is not. When it comes to humanitarian leave to remain, every issue one wants to raise is taken on board. There is a statutory right to apply to the Minister for that, and one is open to put everything one wants on the table, so to speak. There is a net issue for the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to deal with. There is nothing stopping them from issuing any recommendation they like at the moment, but if they are given this statutory function, they will have to listen to all the possible humanitarian arguments. That would treble or quadruple the issues and length of time that all of this would take.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has approved the Irish system and it is a very good system. I do not want to throw a spanner in the works by saying that in addition to considering their statutory functions, the commissioner and tribunal are now being given a broad remit to effectively give the Minister a recommendatory report in all of these cases on general humanitarian considerations which have nothing to do with refugee applications.I would not find it helpful; in fact, I would find it very unhelpful if every hearing before the RAC or the RAT ended up with correspondence to me evaluating the humanitarian issues. I bear the brunt of that, with my officials, and I have to make decisions which are consistent with each other and put things into the balance. The RAC and RAT do not have to do that. They have narrow legal functions. They do not know what another tribunal member is deciding on in terms of recommendations on similar facts. Consistency would go out the window. They would have to turn themselves into a collective college to determine standards on these issues, which would be way outside their remit.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The reason I put down the amendment was that the commissioner and the tribunal are the two independent bodies that look at applications - one at the application itself and the other at the appeal. They have obviously acquired considerable information and an opinion on the application before them, and they would be in a position to be of assistance to the Minister by providing that information to the Minister if somebody goes on to apply on humanitarian grounds. That body of information should not be lost lightly. Otherwise applicants are left exclusively at the tender mercies of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, with the Minister coming cold to the application on humanitarian grounds. Whatever information is provided by the applicant at that point or by letters of support from sympathisers or whatever would be of valuable assistance to the Minister in making a decision as he would be made fully abreast of the situation by the only independent people who actually looked at the matter.I ask the Minister whether he would turn the situation around so that, rather than have the commissioner or tribunal making the recommendation to the Minister, he would revert to them if he felt it necessary to get some information that he needed. Is that process taking place? If, say, somebody applies to the Minister on humanitarian grounds after they have gone through the application and the appeal and have been refused, would the Minister, in any circumstances, feel that it would be beneficial to him to revert to either the initial application under the commissioner or to the appeal under the tribunal for information that might be of value in making his decision?

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	135	There is no specific provision for that but I have seen cases where it has happened. If that does happen, my ears of course prick up because somebody is refusing an applicant on one ground but saying that I should bear in mind something or other. That is of interest to me. In all of these cases the full refugee file comes to my Department and my office and I can see the whole story. One is then dealing with a separate matter. By definition, there have been two decisions against the applicant at this stage, and one is now being asked to address a different issue, notwithstanding the fact that, in effect, it has been conclusively decided that the person is not entitled to refugee status.One then must address the question of what to do with this person in any event. It is a totally separate issue. Do you send them home? What are the implications for them? I assure the committee that, at that stage, virtually anything is put on the table. I do not want to breach people's privacy but the fact that there are serious illnesses on the part of some of the people concerned, family circumstances, educational matters and a whole series of other factors then come into play. Each and every one of them is dealt with on an individual basis.If we were to announce what does and does not qualify for humanitarian leave to remain here, everybody would gear their applications to indicate that is the kind of thing the Minister accepts and many people would simply mould their argument and submissions to what they understood had been accepted on a previous occasion. Every case is dealt with on an individual basis. The reasons people are given leave to remain vary greatly such as the illness of a dependent child who can get treatment only in Ireland. There is not a mathematical basis to this. Sometimes the person concerned may simply be in a relationship with an Irish person. All sorts of issues arise. One cannot say that as long as one has established that one is in a relationship with an Irish person that means the Minister will never send one back to one's country of origin. Members can imagine what would happen if that was understood to be the general position, but there are genuine cases where those kinds of issues arise.

The Minister exercises his discretion on humanitarian grounds. I do not know whether he wants to tell us about the criteria that is used at that stage, but can he give us an idea of the quantity of cases involved? We are talking about the numbers coming through whose applications were refused at first stage, the increasing numbers whose applications were granted at appeal stage and the number of appeals that come through to the Minister. Presumably a good number of people whose applications are refused seek a final direction.

I do not how many people simply fold their tent and accept the position. In any event, I do not believe it would be a useful figure because many people make their applications and do not turn up. Therefore, a decision goes against them. They may or may not re-emerge to make a humanitarian argument. They may have simply disappeared into the undergrowth so to speak and may intend to have no further contact. Of the people who are above board and argue their case, I imagine a substantial proportion of them would do what I said. Of cases decided in 2002 when Irish born children was a ground for consideration, 3,123 applications were granted on that basis.

In page 8, paragraph (a)(i), line 12, to delete “2003” and substitute “2005”.For the information of members, this is Government amendment 7 in the explanatory notes which we provided. The current provision in section 7A 4(a) of the Refugee Act 1996 provides that the Refugee Advisory Board shall, beginning in 2001, prepare and submit to the Minister a report in writing on the operation in the preceding two years of the Act of 1996. That aim was unachievable since the Act as a whole only commenced in November 2000. The Bill currently provides an amendment in section 6(a)(i) which changes the date of requirement to report from 2001 to 2003. We are postponing that requirement by two years. However, as the Bill will not now be passed until the middle of 2003, there is a need to push the statutory date out further to 2005. This is due to the slowness of matters. This will be a two year report.

The Act commenced in 2000. There has been a three year delay.While the Government must be the final arbiter of policy on the asylum process and provision of support services to asylum seekers, especially as approximately €350 million of Exchequer funding is being allocated annually to this area, I fully recognise that we do not enjoy a monopoly on wisdom in the area. Other sections of society where there is practical experience in the area and where people work with asylum seekers and refugees on a day to day basis have a contribution to make. While I see a role for some effective consultation framework to provide input into policy development and asylum seeker and refugee matters generally, I am not convinced that the current legislative framework offers the correct framework for the efficient and effective enhancement of work in the area. With that in mind, I am examining various options for change. I emphasise that irrespective of the type of arrangement that is put in place it should be capable of making a value added contribution to asylum and refugee matters, one which would benefit genuinely those in need of international protection.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The motivation for these amendments is based on what I would consider a mistaken assumption, that by allowing lengthy periods for people to demonstrate a renewed commitment to co-operating in the investigation of their asylum cases, that must be in some way fairer than the sensible limits proposed in the Government amendment. My view is that the opposite is the case because the only persons to profit from the protraction of the asylum process are those who have no basis for their claims in the first place.I emphasise that it is a serious matter when people come to Ireland and seek the protection of the State. It is not a matter of coming here and thinking one will get on with the rest of one's life and incidentally one will get around to addressing the basis on which one is here. This is about a person who is fleeing persecution from a State from which he or she is claiming protection and, therefore, the priority for genuine asylum seekers is to establish their status as soon as possible. If persecution is genuinely feared, it is not a matter of one coming here and saying that sometime one will get around to pursuing one's asylum claim. Establishing one's status as an asylum seeker should be the number one priority in a genuine asylum seeker's mind. Senator Tuffy and I discussed this at great length in the Seanad.I do not want to go on at length about this, but if one is engaging with the Irish State and seeking to invoke the 1951 Act, we require one to engage in the process seriously and effectively and not to do it half heartedly, when it suits one or when one's other social and human priorities allow one to engage in it. This is serious business. If one comes to Ireland and engages in our asylum seeking process, the Irish State takes that seriously. We arrange for interpreters, case studies to be done, hearings to be held and legal aid for applicants. We expect people to take the process equally seriously. The time limits provided for in the Bill are adequate and devised with a view to ensuring that genuine asylum seekers get on with their case and that they have their status declared as soon as possible so that once they are accepted as being entitled to the protection of the Irish State, they can integrate into Irish society, engage in employment and enjoy all the rights that we accord to refugees as soon as possible. The Irish State does not want to keep anybody in a state of suspended animation for longer than is necessary. We have looked at this long and hard and we are satisfied that the current limits are reasonable. This does not militate against a genuine asylum seeker but plays straight into the hands of bogus applicants.Only 47% of interviews proceed in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner on the day fixed. The majority of people walk away from the process or fail to turn up. That is serious from the point of view of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. She has to arrange for interpreters and put together the files and studies. She has to orientate her office towards doing the work scheduled on the day specified. A good deal of effort goes into getting these hearings up and running. These matters are not arranged on the basis that an applicant comes in and an official pulls down that person's file and deals with him or her. The person hearing a case has prepared for the occasion, arranged for an interpreter, studied the country in question and knows the facts. In those circumstances it is a serious matter when only 47% of people turn up for and proceed with their interviews. The refugee legal service has also been teed up for the occasion and if it is cancelled, that is another waste of resources.I emphasise to Deputy Costello that Senator Tuffy and I discussed this matter at great length in the Seanad. I am satisfied that if we lengthen these periods of time in the manner suggested, we will merely throw the work of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner into reverse, wipe out all the progress we have made recently and give a charter to people who effectively do not intend to turn up.Amendment No. 41 is in a slightly different vein. It would allow the response time to run, in the case of an applicant demonstrating failure to co-operate with the commissioner's investigation, not from the sending of the warning letter but from its receipt. That might sound perfect, but we must live in the real world. It is clearly impractical. All a reluctant applicant has to do to make a nonsense of the system is to be sure not to receive the letter, to go missing. The amendment would offer an answer in every case by a simple response from the applicant such as "I never got the letter, I was not where I was supposed to get the letter and never got it."The courts in successive cases concerning immigration and asylum matters, have specifically acknowledged the good sense of having time periods run from the date of the issue of notices rather than the date of their proven receipt on the basis that any other approach would be unworkable in practical terms. This amendment would play straight into the hands of people who would say they never got the letter.If one asks the Irish State to accept one as an asylum seeker and to investigate one's case, one's duty is to be where the letter would find one. One's duty is to engage in the process. One does not have the right to go off and follow one's other pursuits in Ireland, whatever they are, recreational or cultural, and to say one is not around to receive letters or to engage in the process.

The Minister's intention is to provide as little flexibility as possible, to tie the schedule of interviews, the sending of letters, the whole application process, into a strict timespan. The difficulty with that is that we are talking about newcomers to the shores of this country, people who often do not speak the same language as us, people who may not have a settled address and who may often need an interpreter. A second chance is not being provided. Therefore, if one misses one's interview, one is out of the process - one strike and one is out. If it is a requirement that a person must give his or her address within five days, it must be noted that such a person may not have a settled address. The Minister intends to make provision for centres for people coming here seeking asylum. However, many people here are not in full control in terms of where they are based, the language and the way matters function here.This is a different country and environment from that in which they have operated and lived. The application process is being tied down to such an extent here that there is no grounds for a reasonable excuse to be given. The process will operate from the time a letter is sent out. One cannot operate effectively from the time that the letter is received because one cannot determine the time the letter is received. If only a short space of time is provided, there is no room to accommodate the situation where the letter is mislaid because it is not properly addressed or the person, for a good reason, is not in a position to either receive the letter or reply to it within the specified time.There are grounds for having a greater degree of flexibility than is provided for here. If we simply will not deal with people because of the exigencies of such a tight timespan, it will create an injustice in the asylum application process. The Minister wants to tighten up the system but he is doing it to such a degree, like in the case of carriers' liability, that it often militates against the tenor of the international agreements we have entered into on this matter. The Minister could grant more time.With regard to the five days for making an application, for example, there is no requirement to give one's address within those five days. The amendment suggests that the Minister extend the period to 20 days. He might feel that is inappropriate but five days is a short time. Will the Minister look again at this matter and reconsider the provision in light of the needs of the person in question?

There is a raft of amendments and it is unsatisfactory to deal with them like this. The amendments seek to make the process reasonable. The Minister is being unreasonable about the process, which is being fast-tracked to such a degree that people will not be able to keep up with it. The Minister is talking about a reasonable, prudent person in the Irish context but we are talking about asylum seekers, all of whom have come from countries where there is a different way of life, different language and different circumstances. They might not have an address so there will be difficulty with communication. The Minister insists that, in effect, they get their act together within this space of time and provide an address within five days. If they do not, they are out. It is most unsatisfactory.

In page 8, line 38, after "withdrawn" to insert "unless the applicant is accommodated under direct provision in which case it shall be the duty of the Minister to inform the Commissioner of the applicant's address".This amendment would apply where if, after five working days have elapsed since making an application for a declaration and the applicant has not informed the commissioner of his or her address, they shall be deemed to be withdrawn unless the applicant is accommodated under direct provision. The amendment ties in with the Minister's stated desire to have a streamlined, fast-track system of processing applications. In a situation where direct provision is provided by the Government, the Minister can bypass the applicant and provide the address directly himself. Why should not the Minister inform the commissioner, who will be interviewing the applicant, of the address directly? There should be no problem about that. In fact, in those circumstances, the Minister could shift from working days since the making of the application to working days from receipt of the application. The Minister knows precisely where the person is in the case of direct provision and he can ensure that the letter is delivered. The matter can thus be tied up to more securely.In any case, if there is no address on arrival there is obviously a problem but if direct provision is provided for an applicant who is an asylum seeker, and the Minister has provided such provision, it should be the Minister's duty to inform the commissioner of the applicant's address. There should not be any hassle and it should be a straightforward system whereby there would be no doubt about the communications being delivered. I would have thought the amendment would fit in with the tailored scheme the Minister has presented to us in the various sections we have just been discussing.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	185	The applicant will be housed by the Minister in all cases because we will not provide other accommodation in respect of applications from now on. It is true that ORAC, the Office of the Refugees Applications Commission, can find out from the Minister where the address is but we are absolutely determined that the onus is placed on the asylum seeker to notify the commissioner of his or her whereabouts. Those are the terms upon which we offer asylum and there are no others. We will not get into a position of providing excuses for people. If they invoke the State's protection it will be explained to them in their own language at the very beginning that they will undertake to notify the State of their whereabouts. That is the basis upon which they apply. As long as we have people focused on their own obligations to participate in the process and to make sure they are notified of every step in the process, the system will work. If we begin to create situations where people assume that somebody else will discharge their obligations to tell the commissioner where they reside, a failure of communications will arise. It is explained to every asylum seeker in his or her own language that the only basis on which the State will accept applications for asylum is that the applicant accepts the onus of informing the State of their whereabouts. Once that is clearly understood as the basic ground rule, everybody is happy and it will work well. If we begin to introduce a rule whereby somebody will do it in exceptional cases, we are introducing uncertainty. It is a fair system that if one comes to Ireland from a country where one claims to be persecuted and seeks the protection of the State, the very least one can do is comply with the simple requirements the State imposes, one of which is to inform the State of one's whereabouts.

The Bill was published in February 2002 at which time there was a presumption that there would not be direct provision. It was not the order of the day when the Bill was introduced. That is why the change of address provision is included. The Minister has indicated previously that he is taking the road of direct provision, although he has not said as much here. Perhaps he could confirm that. If he is providing direct provision - and my amendment only relates to that - and wants to streamline the system, surely he can have some role in ensuring that people are at the address they are supposed to be, that they receive the documentation that is sent to them and that they turn up for interview when they are supposed to. Much of what the Minister is saying may not be part and parcel of the provisions he is proposing because if it relates to direct provision there is a different way of ensuring all of this takes place. That is the thrust of my amendment. Perhaps the Minister can indicate whether he is contemplating that all accommodation will, in future, be provided through direct provision. If that is the case, we are looking at a different approach to the manner in which the commissioner deals with the applicants.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	187	It is very simple. As a matter of fact that is my intention but as a matter of law I am not willing to budge one inch from the proposition that the asylum seeker undertakes to engage with the Irish system. One of the things asylum seekers undertake to do is to keep ORAC informed as to their whereabouts. If they are in the same place they were allocated to originally, and if my intentions as to direct provision are complied with in every case, it is still less of an imposition on the asylum seeker that that should be so. I will not undertake any further onus in respect of notification. That is a matter for the asylum seeker. It is a light duty to impose on an asylum seeker and I will not create any loopholes where an individual may say, "I did not know", "I moved from A to B" or "I was moved from A to B and I never got the letter". I will not go down that road. The one thing an asylum seeker undertakes to do is to engage with the Irish authorities and the onus is cast on him or her to do that. As far as I am concerned, I will not budge on that issue.

If an asylum seeker is in receipt of direct provision and is moved on the fifth day, by the time he or she is able to inform the commissioner, the time will have lapsed. In most cases, an asylum seeker in receipt of direct provision would probably not have that facility or would not be informed prior to being moved. Whoever is in charge of asylum seekers and where they are accommodated need only press a button on a computer to inform the commissioner of their whereabouts, although I am not saying it should be solely that individual's duty.I understand from where the Minister is coming but those allocating accommodation to asylum seekers should pass on that information to the commissioner. In the event of an asylum seeker being moved at the last minute, he or she should be able to say he or she did not get that information to the commissioner within the five working days but did so on the sixth or seventh working day and that the commissioner should have been informed he or she was moving from one venue to another. This should be streamlined and the same computer system should be used so that everything is on the one file.We should not depend on people who are often afraid of a state system, as they were in their own countries. Even in this country, a number of people do not like dealing with bureaucracy and officialdom. Where possible, we have tried to make our state system as friendly as possible in that the State takes on some of these tasks. I do not believe it should be any different for asylum seekers. The State should take on a simple task such as this, especially in the case of individuals fleeing persecution and so on. We should make the application process as simple as possible for asylum seekers so that they can abide by the rules. Officials should help them. In this case, it is only a matter of pressing a button on a computer to show that an asylum seekers has been moved to Cork and that if documentation needs to be sent, he or she will be there for the next ten days or whatever.

As a matter of law, I will not create any new pretext for people to avoid their obligations. I reiterate a simple point to Deputy Ó Snodaigh. This is not a case of people being disinclined to engage with bureaucracies or being afraid of state authorities. The Irish State is the state they are asking to protect them and they must engage fully. There seems to be a desire among some to adopt a kind of passive approach to asylum seekers whereby they arrive here after which they are our problem. That is not the way it works. The system is that one arrives in Ireland, one engages and continues to engage until such time as one gets a decision. One must abide by the processes laid down.I will not go down the road whereby people arrive, claim asylum, disappear into the woodwork, do not attend for interviews, cause huge inconvenience to the State, are somehow passive participants in a process and where it is up to the State to re-engage with them, to find out where they are and to chase them around Ireland or England, to which they frequently go, in order to take the next step. That is not the way I will go.I want to make it clear that the philosophy of this legislation is that nobody is a passive asylum seeker and that everybody who comes here is given legal aid, direct provision and that arrangements are made for their interview. Much resources go into this process. People are not passive participants in this process and they must show as much energy as they showed in getting to Ireland in moving to the next stage. As a matter of international law, the onus of proof is on them. They must show as much energy in committing themselves to getting an adjudication by the State on whether they are entitled to asylum. We cannot have a situation where people just fall over the line in terms of getting into Ireland and then say to the State, "It is your problem to find us and to sort us out". That is not the way our system works.

The Minister quoted some statistics. He stated 47% of people did not turn up for interview for a variety of reasons.

Will the Minister not streamline the system to ensure everybody is directly communicated with? Where a person is being accommodated, those responsible for that accommodation who come under the aegis of the Minister should be able to ensure all letters and communications are delivered and that the commissioner is informed of the address of the person who is to be interviewed and ensure he or she arrives at the interview in time and on the correct date. That is all we are talking about; we are not initiating a major legal challenge to what the Minister is attempting to do or to his responsibilities. If the Minister streamlines the system, we can get rid of the defects and the flaws about which the Minister is giving out.

In page 8, paragraph (b), between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:"(iv) the substitution in subsection (10)(b)(i) of ’21 days’ for ’10 days’, and(v) the substitution in subsection (14)(a) of ’21 days’ for ’10 days’,”.This amendment proposes to extend from ten days to 21 days the maximum period between court appearances for an applicant detained under section 9(8) of the Refugee Act.At present, a person detained under section 9 must, as soon as practicable, be brought before a District Court judge to have his or her detention reviewed. If the judge is satisfied that any or all of the grounds under section 9(8) apply to the person, then he or she may commit the person to detention for a period of up to ten days in accordance with section 9(10)(b). If the judge is of the view that section 9(8) no longer applies to the person, then he or she shall release the person and may make that release subject to one or more conditions specified in section 10(b)(ii). These conditions require the applicant to reside in a certain place, report to the Garda or surrender passports or travel documents. A person who fails to comply with these conditions may also be made subject to detention under section 9. Any person committed to such detention may be committed to the District Court for further periods of up to ten days and each further period of detention is subject to review in the same way.The existing requirement of the Act that the person be brought before the court as soon as the grounds for detention no longer apply, allied to the court review arrangements, are sufficient safeguards against anyone being detained for longer than is necessary. I am concerned to ensure that, where the last resort of detention - which I stress is the last resort - is the appropriate course, it should work in a way that not only secures the rights and protection of detainees but also does so with a reasonably efficient use of resources.My amendment proposes to extend the period to 21 days and with the view that the current ten day detention period has the potential to place an undue burden on the already heavily stretched resources of the courts and the Garda Síochána. I stress, however, that, where a District Court judge believes that in a specific case a period of detention would be excessive, the amendment gives increased flexibility to him or her not to order such detention and it will be open to the person in question to argue for a lesser period of remand or adjournment of his or her case where he or she is in detention.This is not designed to force the District Court to a certain outcome. The court, which consists of men and women who are sworn to uphold everyone's constitutional rights and to apply fair processes, will decide the appropriate adjournment in each case. What the section as amended would do would be to give the District Court the right to increase the period of detention to 21 days if that is considered just by the individual District Court judge.Only about 30 people have been detained under the Refugee Act 1996 since November 2000 when it came into operation. It is not the practice to detain people except in exceptional circumstances. Committee members should know it is only where it is considered to be the last resort available that it is done. I have better things to do with the cells I have available to me. I am not anxious to place asylum seekers in them. There is no policy of mass detention.However, there are certain circumstances, such as happened in Shannon, where a group of people are detained for periods. It was the only appropriate response in the Shannon case. The people had come to Ireland from India via Moscow. They had made arrangements with people to ferry them from Shannon in buses. In such circumstances, it was abundantly clear that, if they were not detained, we would never see them again because arrangements had been made with people in England to accommodate them. In such exceptional circumstances, the power to detain was used. It is not in the State's interest to detain people except where it is necessary, but there are certain circumstances, such as that incident where a complex plan was discovered half-way through its execution and where there was every reason to believe that, if they were set at liberty, we would never see them again and that they would abuse the common travel area and disappear having abused the asylum process in Ireland.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	198	It would appear strange, if this is a power that is seldom used and to which only 30 people have been subject since December 2000, that there is a need to more than double the period of detention. It is one of the issues on which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has specifically focused and criticised. Where the UNHCR agrees with the Minister is that detention of asylum applicants is inherently undesirable and should only be used as a last resort. The UNHCR goes on to describe the list of circumstances where it could be used and states that it should only be used in the following clearly circumscribed circumstances: to verify identity, to determine the elements on which the claim for refugee status or asylum is based, to deal with cases where refugees or asylum seekers have destroyed their travel or identity documents or are using fraudulent ones, or to protect national security or public order. Perhaps the Minister's description of what happened with the people from India falls into the last category. The UNHCR indicates clearly as well that there should also be appropriate facilities and that people should not be detained with convicted criminals.The final paragraph is where the UNHCR is strongest with its criticism, stating that it notes with concern that the Immigration Bill proposes to amend section 9 of the Refugee Act by extending the detention period of certain asylum seekers prior to judicial review from ten to 21 days. The UNHCR goes on to say that it would prefer to maintain the ten day time limit which it says is more in line with best State practice in this area. While the UNHCR has complimented the Minister in its initial remarks, that he has kept in line with good practice and refrained from exercising a policy of detention in respect of asylum seekers, and hopes he will continue along that line, it is critical of the Minister's extension of the period in which detention would take place from ten to 21 days.Nothing the Minister has said convinces us of the need to more than double the detention period. In fact, he said the opposite, that there is a need to keep cells vacant for domestic criminals, so to speak, and that the last thing he needs to do is detain people in cells that could be used for an alternative purpose. Unless the Minister intends to use this process more often to detain more people between judicial hearings, why does he need this extension? Why incur the wrath of the UNHCR on the matter?

Detention should be used as a last resort and the Minister said that. I am concerned about the extension of the detention period from ten to 21 days, not least because there are no guarantees that anyone detained under this change in the legislation will be kept separate from convicted criminals. There are no commitments in this regard and it is one of the points raised by the UNHCR, that at the very least those detained should be kept separate but also that, if it is a last resort, it should be for the least amount of time possible.The Minister had a ten day detention limit available to him and, if it has not been used that often, I do not see why it needs to be extended to 21 days. A ten day limit is fine and it should possibly be lower than that if we are to believe it is a last resort. I urge the Minister to withdraw the amendment, leave the detention period of ten days as the maximum and give some commitment that those detained under these provisions are kept separate from convicted criminals in prisons, especially given that many of them will not have the language or will be from different cultures and are likely to be victimised in prison. We await reports to determine whether there is racism in our jails, though I and certain organisations believe it is endemic. We must be careful that this facility is used as a last resort but if it is, those convicted should not be victimised within the prison system.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I accept that the UNHCR would prefer if we stuck with ten days but I do not accept her language was critical. She expressed the view that she would prefer the ten day period. I am dealing with a case in which, for example, 20 people engaged in a mass attempt to evade our immigration law. In order to produce the evidence to sustain their expulsion from the State, I may have to produce witnesses from the UK and make inquiries in India, Russia and so on. Deputy Ó Snodaigh might ask why, after ten days in the training unit in Mountjoy, they should not return to the District Court in Shannon for an appearance every ten days rather than 21 days. However, the District Court judge should listen to both sides and make a 15 or 18 day adjournment because he knows the State will not be able to go on after ten days as it will not have its case together. The judge should be able to make that determination after hearing both sides. The alternative is a pointless hearing involving a convoy of prison officers and gardaí, all on overtime, criss-crossing the country for a hearing everyone knew from day one would be pointless. However, the Act states ten days is the maximum so the District Court had to set a date, though it knew it could not deal with the issue, in order to satisfy the outer limit in the Act. I am trying to provide workable law.The UNHCR report is very complimentary about the Irish system. We could have a system of closed detention centres and of routine detention. We have the most open system in Europe because we have an internal system that trusts people; we normally give bail to our own people on a basis unavailable elsewhere in Europe. We have a liberal regime. However, we are bringing 20-odd people across Ireland frequently - it is not that frequent so I should not use the word "frequently" - to court hearings which are entirely pointless. There is a convoy to a pointless court hearing just to comply with the Act, even though on day one the District Court judge knows that there will be no useful purpose served by the first hearing and that nothing would happen. In those circumstances this is a reasonable measure.

If we were to have that attitude then most District Court hearings would be pointless and futile. One need only go to Dublin District Court every day and hear the adjournments announced, some going on for two years.The other issue about travelling around the country is that most prisons in the State are close enough to District Courts, sometimes right next to prisons, such as Clover Hill, Castlerea; it may also be the situation in Limerick. One is not talking about huge convoys and I hope the Minister is not putting the State to huge expense. There could be quick hearings within the ten days without putting the State to huge expense, until such time as the State has gathered its evidence and proceeded properly.

If that comes about then this provision would not be necessary as people in custody could appear in District Court in Shannon by video link while remaining in Mountjoy; all of this would not be necessary in that case. However, while it is necessary and while we do not have video links in all our courts at present, then this is reasonable. In the case I referred to there was considerable expense in shifting people around Ireland for court appearances.

Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to amendment No. 31 are related, therefore, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 to amendment No. 31 and amendment No. 31 will be discussed together.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I move amendment No. 31:
In page 8, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:"(c) by the insertion in section 9A of the following subsection after subsection (4):'(5) The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána shall arrange for the maintenance of a record of fingerprints taken pursuant to subsection (1).',".This is a technical amendment to make it clear in statute that the Garda Síochána bears the responsibility for maintaining the database of fingerprints of asylum seekers taken in accordance with subsection (1). The Garda is the only body in the State with the expertise to manage such a database in the highly skilled and technical matter of fingerprint records. It is important to place that aspect on a statutory footing.I would like to indicate that I will be proposing a further amendment on Report Stage which will address the minimum age for the taking of fingerprints. While I do not want to delay the committee now on the subject, I want to say there is evidence of a trend in movement of children and, unless we are in a position to fingerprint and identify young children, there is a significant danger that people will be trafficked at tender ages without any capacity to find out what child is moving where and in what circumstances. I will address that issue on Report Stage.

It is important to clarify that the Garda is the body responsible. What security is in place in relation to the database and what arrangements are made for sharing a database of that nature with other member states of the European Union? Has the matter proceeded to that extent?In regard to the minimum age, the Minister has not said what he intends the minimum age to be and why he settled for that particular age.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	206	On the minimum age, the Report Stage amendment will allow for flexibility in the case of children I consider vulnerable to be moved in circumstances where I cannot identify them other than by fingerprinting. There will be safeguards in place. Generally speaking, I do not want to fingerprint children. Equally, if an asylum seeker is being trafficked in and out of the country, I want to be in a position to identify the child I was originally dealing with. It is almost impossible unless there is some kind of objective identification of a child. Otherwise one is driven back to the proposition whereby one must rely on other people's statement as to who a particular child is. We have discovered in the past that traffickers do not tell the truth in these matters.In relation to EURODAC this is a separate issue. EURODAC has its own rules and conventions. It self-implementing under an EU arrangement. We are putting in place on an interim basis a semi-automated fingerprint system for asylum seekers which has worked reasonably well to date. Under this arrangement, prints are taken at both ports of entry and at the office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and inputted into an electronic database at Garda headquarters. A code of practice between the relevant agencies has been entered into to ensure that asylum seeker prints are kept separate from prints taken for other purposes.We are turning our attention to the issue of implementing a full long-term solution to electronic fingerprinting of asylum seekers which will enable the State to meet all its domestic and EU obligations and requirements in relation to the fingerprinting of asylum seekers. A consultant, who was employed to look at how the new electronic system would be developed and implemented has recommended that the logical location for this new system would be with the Garda Síochána. There are a number of reasons for that. The acquisition of fingerprinting skills, including the expertise required to verify possible matches, takes a considerable period of time and I am advised that there is a general shortage of people with such skills outside police forces. In Ireland, that expertise lies with the Garda Síochána. The key elements of the current asylum fingerprint database are located with the gardaí who have considerable experience of running and maintaining such databases. The fingerprinting of asylum seekers is already the responsibility of national police forces in a number of EU jurisdictions. In the context of EURODAC, relatively few hits - in other words, identifications of people who have made a prior application somewhere else - are expected during its early operation with the result that there is likely to be an insufficient workload for a full-time fingerprint expert to be stationed elsewhere for the purposes of verification of EURODAC potential matches.In relation to the proposed amendments to the Government amendment, I want to please Deputy Costello by saying I will accept amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 31. I am satisfied that it adds useful information for a person who will be looking at the statute and improves its style. I have been told by the parliamentary counsel that this type of annotation is not necessary legally, but I agree with Deputy Costello that it makes it clearer. What we want is accessible law.As regards the second of Deputy Costello's amendments, I remind the committee that under section 9A(1) of the Refugee Act, fingerprints are to be taken for the purposes of the Act. The section goes on to provide for how long such fingerprints are to be maintained and what is to happen to them. It is self-evident that these records cannot but be maintained in accordance with section 9A. Therefore, this amendment is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it.
