No. 8 is consideration of correspondence item 2013/462. It was agreed at the previous meeting to discuss this correspondence item in public at the next joint committee meeting. Further to the receipt of this item, new correspondence on this subject has been received. I can confirm that the IBOA has written to the joint committee notifying that it is withdrawing its original request. In that context, is it agreed that the issue deserves no further consideration as its request has been withdrawn?

The IBOA is withdrawing its request to appear before the committee. If it wishes to write to us again seeking to appear before the committee it can do so. I will read the letter. Re - IBOA The Finance Union. Dear Mr. Lynch, I refer to our previous correspondence and request to address the Finance Committee. I wish to withdraw that request on the basis that the Liquidator is now engaging with us more regularly and a number of developments have occurred since our initial request that have provided some clarity to staff. I wish to thank the Deputies who supported our request and who have raised the many issues facing IBRC staff in this forum. We will continue to work to ensure the Minister addresses these issues to the satisfaction of members. Yours sincerely, ...The request is withdrawn. Is that agreed? Agreed.
