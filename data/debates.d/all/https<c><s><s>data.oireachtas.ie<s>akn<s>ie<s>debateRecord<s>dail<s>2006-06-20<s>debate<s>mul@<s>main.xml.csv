#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.I met the Finucane family on many occasions. Most recently, I met Geraldine Finucane and other family members during my visit to the United States in March. I had a more detailed meeting with the family on 27 February in Dublin, prior to the debate in March in this House.I am aware that Ken Barrett, who had been jailed in 2004 for the murder of Pat Finucane, has been freed under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. This has obviously been a very difficult development but it is clearly not the end of this issue for the Finucane family, which remains focused on securing a full public inquiry. The family continues to have our full support in this. We have made it clear that we want to see adherence to the standard agreed at Weston Park and set by Judge Cory. We continue to share the concerns of the Finucane family and Judge Cory that the new Inquiries Act, under which the British Government intends to have the Finucane case investigated, will not meet these standards. We continue to raise these issues with the British Government.The Irish Government continues to monitor developments in this matter and remains in frequent contact with the family. I have on all occasions assured the Finucane family of my support for its efforts to achieve the full truth in this case.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I would like to ask the Taoiseach about his meetings with the Finucane family, the British Government and the US authorities. The US Congress recently passed a resolution which gives additional weight to the calls for a credible independent inquiry and the rejection of the British assertion that the Inquiries Act would suffice in this regard. What support has the Taoiseach sought from the US on this matter? He stated that he met the Finucane family in March. Was the family informed about the release of Ken Barrett prior to the event?On 24 May, The Guardian reported that the British Government planned to proceed with the inquiry in London in October. What discussions has the Taoiseach held with the British Government on that matter? Does he know whether members of the US Congress have discussed the matter with the British Government? Did he ever discuss with the British authorities the force research unit, an issue that seems to arise repeatedly in the context of the circumstances surrounding the murder of Pat Finucane? Michael Finucane, Pat Finucane’s son, is on the record as stating that the system worked exactly as intended and, in the British Government’s eyes, it worked perfectly. That is a damning indictment of the system and certainly points to the need for a credible independent inquiry. In light of the discussions the Taoiseach held with the American authorities, the British authorities and the Finucane family, can he answer any of these questions?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	2	As I said in my reply, I meet regularly with the Finucane family, and Geraldine Finucane and other family members contact the small group of officials who work with me on Northern Ireland issues a few times each month.We continue to show our support through a number of steps. The family is continuing its efforts here and in the UK, Europe and the United States to find the full truth in the case and to internationalise it as much as they possibly can. It is clear the Finucane family has considerable support in the United States and that the concerns of this House, which were articulated in the debate held on 8 March, are widely shared in Washington. The US House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on the British Government to establish immediately a fully independent public judicial inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane and we played our role in that. The Finucane family is pressing for a Senate resolution mirroring the recent congressional motion which was passed and has written to every Senator to lobby for support. We support the family and wish it well on that initiative. Tentative proposals have also been brought before the European Parliament in a motion. Various Irish and international groups have always taken an interest in this matter. We are briefing them and they are being briefed by the family. The campaign is ongoing. At this point we are continuing to help the family by exerting the maximum political pressure on the British Government. I have no sense that the British are willing to meet the family's needs. Until I see otherwise, I will not state that there is an indication of this happening. There is a view that, in the absence of securing agreement with the family about the inquiry, there is little point in holding an inquiry bearing in mind the expense involved. It would be a tragedy if the truth did not emerge and I have continually said that to the British Government. Therefore, I hope a way can be found to meet the family's needs. That is the agenda we have followed. At this stage it is a lobbying exercise to force them to address the issues.Regarding Deputy Sargent's point about various reports, the Government has always been concerned by persistent reports of collusion between security forces and paramilitaries in the North. We have raised these issues with the British Government, continue to do so and will do so when the Minister for Foreign Affairs meets Secretary of State Hain on 26 June. We have raised the issues at every point and have tried to address these concerns at Weston Park by identifying the cases for investigation. This is our point and that of all those who support the Finucane family. High-profile cases were chosen and investigated by Judge Cory. We asked that they be the subject of public inquiry if necessary. In the cases of Rosemary Nelson, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright the inquiries are under way. In this jurisdiction Judge Smithwick is conducting the inquiry into the case Judge Cory recommended Ireland should address, the murder of RUC officers Harry Breen and Bob Buchanan. There is no progress on Judge Cory's recommendation of a full inquiry into the case of Pat Finucane. That failure is a matter of concern to the Government, the parties in this House and the wider community. We will continue to address these issues with the British Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Mr. Ken Barrett was sentenced to at least 22 years for the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane after he admitted and pleaded guilty to the murder of the Belfast solicitor who was shot dead in the presence of his family. The House accepted a motion from the Opposition that there be a full public independent judicial inquiry into the murder. The politics of Great Britain are a matter for politicians there. Does the Taoiseach believe there is anything else this House of Parliament can do? The truth in this case must come out. This man was murdered and there was collusion between the British security forces and the loyalist death squad that carried out the assassination. It is a pain to the members of the Finucane family who have battled for justice for their husband and father. I am not sure what more we can do besides voicing our opinion.The House has taken a unified approach to this, the Taoiseach regularly meets Prime Minister Blair and the answer lies in amending the UK Inquiries Act 2005 to allow for a full public independent judicial inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane. I expect the Taoiseach will raise the matter with Prime Minister Blair as often as necessary. Must the Irish Government embarrass the British Government into action? The truth should be fundamental to politics and I expect the Taoiseach to raise the matter in as vigorous a manner as he can on behalf of the Irish people. This may eventually yield a positive result.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Needless to say, I appreciate that support throughout. The situation is unsatisfactory. I will not put any gloss on it. We are at a stalemate on the issue. I feel bad about it for a number of reasons, mainly for the Finucane family. What I probably feel most upset about is we followed an honourable path and went into a fair process of picking a number of cases, of getting an eminent judge, and convincing everybody to follow that process, which was not easy at the time.It took a long time to get an eminent world-known judge, and I have never heard anybody dispute the fact that Judge Cory was so. When he was on the Canadian court, he was well known internationally. He made a clear report of what the process was, not only then but a number of times since.The British Government will not honour the agreement. It has offered a different type of inquiry. Not to put a tooth in it because I have spent so many hours talking to different people about the discussion, the reason is it will not subject the military authorities to an open forum on this. That is the issue. It is not really about anything else. That is the difficulty.

If the British insist on holding an inquiry under the Inquiries Act, which would be unacceptable, would the Taoiseach consider calling a summit specifically on this issue of collusion with the British Prime Minister to deal with it once and for all? Would he accept that perhaps that would be the only way of dealing with it at this stage?More evidence has emerged of British agents having been involved in the Loughinisland slaughter in 1994, when the UVF killed——

We have raised the issue of collusion with the British, especially in respect of a number of incidences and at every opportunity in respect of the Finucane case, of which we are speaking. We will do so again next week when the Minister for Foreign Affairs meets Peter Hain. We will use the opportunity to raise these issues again.

We do not accept that position.I already replied on the core point in this. I do not know, and cannot tell the House, whether the British will proceed with this in the autumn. Both we and the Finucane family have told them it will not have our support. The international and national groups which support the family have made their point. It would be a costly——

They are well aware of all the motions.We must see if pressure will increase. Last year I got the American President to raise this issue directly with Prime Minister Blair. We must continue to press this issue but while I understand what the British are at in this case, I do not for a second accept it. I understand their tactic, which is difficult to move against, for the reason I have stated.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	17	On the question of collusion between elements of the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries, does the Taoiseach know when the Nuala O'Loan report on the shooting of Raymond McCord and related matters is likely to be put in the public domain? Arising from the Taoiseach's reply about Weston Park, it was also agreed at that meeting that the Smithwick committee would begin hearings into allegations of collusion involving the Garda in the murder of two RUC men. When are those hearings likely to commence?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	18	On the first question, the latest date is the end of the month. We have been given a few dates and they have changed, but it is still expected very shortly. I cannot be certain about that. It is long finished and it is being examined by a number of groups.With regard to Judge Smithwick, all the preliminary work is under way on the basis of the paperwork I have seen and the questions that have arisen. I do not know when the hearings will start but the process has been under way for some time.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I refer to the report of an inquiry taking place in October. Are the British planning to proceed with some class of an inquiry under the Inquiries Act?Michael Finucane stated clearly regarding the force research unit of the British Army that the system worked exactly as intended and, in the British Government's eyes, it worked perfectly. Does the Taoiseach's information allow him to make such a clear, black and white statement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	20	It does not. If it did, a public inquiry would not be needed. However, I have always felt there was collusion at a high level. I would like a public inquiry into this because of who Pat Finucane was, the work he was doing and the way he was gunned down based on whatever level of collusion. It is not a black and white situation but there was collusion in the case.On the first issue, it has been reported that the British Government has organised a judge, an office and is ready to proceed in the autumn. I have seen nothing in the past number of months to indicate that is the case. I might have more news on that next week but I have no information now. The British Government hoped it would convince us all that its inquiry was satisfactory but it has not convinced us and organisations such as British-Irish Rights Watch of that. I do not know whether the British Government will proceed without any support and without making the necessary amendments.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.On 19 May 2006, the chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission wrote to inform me of the decision of the commission on this matter. The commission concluded that the complaint did not warrant the commencement of an investigation under the ethics Acts. The commission, however, was of the view that it was not appropriate for an office holder to request the attendance of a civil servant at a parliamentary party meeting, even though it accepted the importance of briefings on technical issues being available to legislators who are considering complex proposals. To avoid any perception of partiality by a civil servant, the commission has recommended that in future where meetings are arranged to allow officials to give detailed technical briefings, the facility should be provided on an all-party basis. I accept the thrust of the recommendation of the standards commission and my Department is considering the most appropriate arrangement to meet its concerns.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	22	This briefing, in which the Minister instructed a civil servant to brief the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, concerned the groceries order. Members of the parliamentary party must be confused as to how prices have risen so greatly subsequently, but that is a different issue. What action did the Taoiseach take as a result of receiving the communication from the Standards in Public Office Commission that it was inappropriate for a Minister to use a civil servant in this fashion?Although Fianna Fáil tends to identify itself with the nation, does the Taoiseach now accept that it is wrong to use a public official as though he or she were a political servant of the Minister? Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the level of compliance on the part of his Ministers and Ministers of State in respect of the code of conduct for office holders? In particular, is he satisfied with the compliance in terms of declarations on the register of interests by Ministers and Ministers of State?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	23	On the second issue, everyone has an obligation to fill in their forms. People are now familiar with them and are aware of their duties in this regard. In so far as they have filled in the forms, I am satisfied.On the first question, as I said, I accept the point made by the Standards in Public Office Commission. While the commission concluded that the complaint did not warrant commencement of an investigation, it gave its view on this matter. Obviously, we will try to work out how it can be implemented. While a number of points are involved, I have brought it to the attention of the Cabinet, Ministers of State and the Government secretariat. We must try to work out what the commission's views mean in effect.According to everyone who has examined this matter, the commission's recommendation states that a civil servant should not be engaged in such briefing to avoid showing partiality to one side rather than the other. While all Members understand this, it has ramifications, because for as long as I have been around, and indeed since the 1924 Act, officials have given briefings on technical or complex issues to Ministers, Ministers of State, or, as they were known, Parliamentary Secretaries, and backbenchers. They have rarely done so at parliamentary party meetings — parliamentary party committees are effectively the same. Officials also have provided briefings to Opposition spokespersons and to those Members of the Oireachtas who have contacted them. Hence, one instance cannot be taken in isolation.From my experience and from that of those who have been around longer, this is a beneficial and useful way for Members of the Oireachtas to deal with technical and complex issues. Such officials may have been studying a particular issue for years and would be able to explain it.This matter cannot be dealt with in a strict political sense, and, as Deputy Rabbitte has put it, Fianna Fáil does not try to politicise it. As the Deputy is aware, this is not the case as such briefings are to try to explain an issue. Hence, this must be examined. In the view of everyone who has read the recommendation, it means civil servants can only engage in a briefing with Members of the Oireachtas on an all-party basis. If that is the case, we must consider how that can be arranged, as well as the degree of formality which is thereby introduced into a system that has worked informally for decades. That is not a good thing and brings a level of formality where it is not necessary. It must be structured accordingly. An official attending a parliamentary party or committee meeting with a Minister, giving information by telephone or meeting a Member of the Opposition or a backbencher is exactly the same.As always, I will accept the judgment of the Standards in Public Office Commission. However, we must engage to see how we can make such a ruling work in effect. Ultimately, we would have to amend the code of conduct for office holders. We must find a way that makes this work meaningful and helpful rather than something that works against the system. I am honoured to have served on both sides of this House and held many positions, including Government backbencher, Opposition backbencher, Minister of State, Minister and Taoiseach. To implement this as written will not be good for the Oireachtas in the future.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Has the Taoiseach sought clarification or has he communicated these views to the Standards in Public Office Commission? He seems to indicate a level of dissent from the decision it made. Does he intend to involve colleagues on this side of the House in drawing up any views that he might put to it? Surely, he is not putting on the basis of equivalence civil servants briefing Ministers or Ministers of State on technical matters or on any matter with them briefing on a politically partisan basis.I note the Taoiseach stated civil servants brief Members on this side of the House. Speaking for myself, it does not happen very much. Some Ministers invite a spokesperson from this side of the House to be briefed on a Bill. Some Ministers do not as they are concerned about an outbreak of knowledge on this side of the House. I do not see how there can be equivalence between that and briefing a parliamentary party meeting as the civil servant in this case was instructed to do. It was an instruction to a civil servant to address a parliamentary meeting that recently lead to the resignation of an official working for a previous Minister of State. I would have thought one strong point of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, is his ability to communicate. I do not rate very highly his ability to read documents or to get into the detail, but he is good at briefing. I do not know why a civil servant would have to be sent in on a case like this.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I am replying to a question. As I said in my reply, I accept the thrust of the recommendation of the Standards in Public Office Commission and my Department is considering the most appropriate arrangements to meet the commission's concern. The Government will make the point I have expressed to obtain clarification. If we can resolve the matter at that level, then we can do so. If obtaining clarification requires reference to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, we can obtain it in this way, but I hope that would be avoidable.My point is about the merit of changing from a system that works very well at present to a more formal one that I do not believe is necessary. If the view is that it is necessary, so be it. I checked on a given week and noted that at least nine Ministers, or either backbenchers or Opposition Members, would have had a direct reference to a civil servant for bona fide reasons. These would have included obtaining clarification, understanding or a briefing from somebody dedicated to a specific area. I do not see what is wrong with this. It has gone on from time immemorial and I do not understand the reason for changing it.The presence of a civil servant at a parliamentary party meeting would be very rare. I can understand that point but I remember many occasions on which a civil servant attended a meeting of a parliamentary party committee. There is no real difference between a parliamentary party and a parliamentary party committee. If one were to say addressing such a body should not be possible unless it is on an all-party basis, one would, by extension, have to include anyone, be he or she a backbencher, front bench spokesperson, member of the Opposition or otherwise. I am not referring to the current Opposition but talking about what has been happening here for years. I do not believe this is necessary because the current system functions very well. On many occasions while in Opposition, I was able to benefit from a civil servant giving an explanation.

I am trying to make a point concerning the future more than the present. We should not close ourselves to systems that operate very well because somebody has a certain view. I accept the view but I would argue it. If limitations had be placed on the existing system, I would accept a provision concerning a parliamentary party. However, if later today, for totally proper reasons, Deputy Rabbitte wanted to be briefed on a Bill by a civil servant who may be the expert on the relevant legislation for the past ten or 15 years, or if he needed to obtain clarification on some point for 15 minutes on which someone may have written to him, there would be nothing wrong with his doing so. There is no sense in the idea that we should have an all-party group comprising members from my side and the other side. The idea involves a misunderstanding of how this House works.

I accept the view expressed because I do not want to take issue with it but I do not want to close down the right of Members of this House who are not officeholders to something that has existed since the implementation of the 1924 Act. I do not regard it as necessary to change the system. On too many occasions, our rights and involvement in processes that are very useful to us are closed down. That is unnecessary. I make that point, but if people convince me otherwise, I will amend the rules. In this case my view is that it is not a good judgment, but I will explore it further.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	44	That has been a very interesting exchange of views. Many years ago, when the then Minister of State, John Donnellan, was here dealing with social welfare and other complex issues about assessments on farms in particular, he admitted he was unable to answer all the questions but would make the person in the Department who could answer the question available for all the parties. His point was that he would make the public servant available to anybody who wanted to ask a question. Now it could be done either by technology, the Internet or whatever.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I do not have a difficulty with that. It is fair that the information should be available to everybody but it should not be done in a collective sense if everybody does not want it. If an Opposition Front Bench spokesperson is dealing with some Act in opposition — we have all been in that position — and wants to have something clarified, there is no need for a formalised committee of the House to do that. It should be available if somebody else wants it, but the chances of someone else wanting that briefing is highly unlikely. My point is that we should not formalise matters that are not necessary.

Is the Taoiseach happy that no other members of the Government are out on a limb about any of this? I know he wants to keep people in check and I am sure he reminds them on a regular basis that they should neither be exposed nor caught in a position where they abuse political responsibility and trust in terms of a Ministry or a Ministry of State. Is he happy that they all clearly understand his message?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	51	There are guidelines, codes of conduct and the ethics Acts, and the Standards in Public Office Commission has laid down what people should do. I do all I can to bring to their attention what is contained in the Acts and guidelines and refer to it every year when they have to fill up their form. I hope people comply with that. The Cabinet secretariat brings home to people the rules and guidelines by which people should abide. A sufficient number of events have happened in recent years for people to understand that and I do my utmost to ensure that. I cannot always be sure that every facet is complete but I hope they do that and I strongly emphasise it to them. It is a separate point to the one I am arguing. On the other one, we need clarification to hold on to systems that are beneficial to us, but as far as the ethics Acts and the Standards in Public Office Commission codes of practice are concerned, I continually highlight to them that they should stay 100% within those guidelines.

I shall make that point, and if I cannot convince it of that, we will have to go ahead. It is a misunderstanding of how a system works.Deputy Kenny's point is correct that if one gets a briefing one should accept it is available to everybody. However, it cannot be formalised in such a manner that if someone wants a briefing everybody else must be present at the same time, and that is how it is being read by everybody. We shall try to resolve that. I do not believe it will be a major issue to resolve. I accept the thrust of the recommendation. I want to see it implemented in a way that does not remove a useful facility which allows this House to work effectively.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The recent value for money examination undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General looked at the rent supplement scheme during the period 2000-05. It did not examine the overall supplementary welfare allowance scheme.The report found that expenditure rose substantially during that period, reaching €369 million in 2005, while recipient numbers rose by 38% to more than 60,000. One third of the overall increase in spending on rent supplement in the period under review is explained by increases in the number of recipients. The remaining two thirds related to increases in average rent supplement payments. The increase in the average rent supplement payment is attributable to a number of factors, including family size, location and rent levels.The Comptroller and Auditor General commented on the need to capture and record additional information which would allow for informed analysis of movement in rent supplement expenditure. The report also raised the issue of adjusting rent limits downwards when rents were reducing in order to avoid unplanned gains by rent supplement landlords and or tenants. In this regard, the Department froze rent limits in 2002 and this, together with subsequent regulations on rents charged, has had a stabilising effect on rent limits in the relevant sector of the market. Rent levels fluctuated throughout the period under review. Data from the CSO show that rents rose up to April 2002 and then fell until January 2005, and have risen slowly since then.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The first question listed on the Order Paper concerns checks and balances in the operation in the Department. These questions are out of order, so I shall obviously have to work with them. The first question put down for me today deals with checks and balances. I shall continue with my reply to that one, if that is all right.The primary objective of the Department's information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements and that they are kept informed of changes and improvements in schemes and services as they occur. The provision of information in a clear and accessible manner is an essential element in the achievement of this objective. Comprehensive information and guidance for social welfare schemes is available through the Department's network of more than 130 local offices throughout the country. Officers in 58 local social welfare offices are dedicated to providing information and are available to explain supports and services, and to assist people in completing forms and assessing their entitlements.The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering every social welfare payment or scheme. These information leaflets are available in a wide range of outlets throughout the country, including all local social welfare officers, citizens' information centres, post offices, many local community centres, as well as from the Department's lo-call leaflet line. The information is also available on the Department's website. The central information services unit in my Department operates a phone service where people can get information on all our services.The Department takes a proactive approach in advertising new schemes and changes, as well as improvements to existing schemes and services, by using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, fact sheets, posters and direct mailshots. Selective use is made of freephone services to provide information on new schemes and services, as well as at particular times of the year, such as at budget time. In addition to information aimed at the public, the Department routinely targets certain specific groups of customers to ensure that they are aware of the supports and services available.In April 2005, a nationwide publicity campaign was undertaken for the respite care grant scheme to target carers who provide full-time care and attention and are, therefore, likely to qualify for the grant. Customers who received a respite grant in 2005 are being contacted regarding their possible entitlement to the grant in 2006. In addition, a fresh information campaign for carers will be undertaken later this year. In September 2005, a copy of the information magazine, Options & Opportunities, was sent out by my Department to more than 86,000 customers who are on the one-parent family payment. Feedback from this circulation to date had been very positive. In March 2006, the Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign to promote and encourage those people to take up the family income supplement. This campaign lasted a week and included advertisements on television and radio, along with the provision of helplines.Every effort is made by the Department to ensure that customers take up their full entitlement. The Department automatically issues application forms for child benefit on receipt of the notification of the birth of a child. New pensioners are issued with a checklist, advising them on all the support to which they may be entitled. The Department also works closely with Comhairle, the national citizens' information service, which provides information on social services in its network of centres throughout the country, on the Oasis website and through the citizens' information phone service. A number of voluntary organisations funded by the Department also carry out much work in this area.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I thank the Minister for his reply. The checks and balances in operation should ensure that only those entitled to receive various payments receive them. In 2004, almost 196,000 customers paid via the electronic funds transfer received mailshots from his Department. Six thousand of those letters were returned and more than 1,000 claimants' claims were terminated. Is the Minister satisfied that the checks and balances in the electronic funds transfer are in operation? Is he satisfied that only those entitled to receive payments from his Department receive them? What happens when claims are terminated? Is it true that they are terminated mainly because the recipients are no longer at the same address? If that is the case, what kind of losses accrue to the State as a result? Are those losses returned to the Exchequer?More than 4,500 letters were returned this year and investigations are ongoing. Why is the electronic funds transfer so loose? Why do so many people seem to receive payments to which they are not entitled? The checks and balances may need to be much tighter.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	67	Nobody should receive a payment to which he or she is not entitled. People sometimes retain payments to which they have lost entitlement owing to increased income and so on. They are required to notify the Department of such information and sometimes they fail to do so. We recovered in excess of €400 million from our different checks, balances, surveys and control measures to ensure that nobody receives funds to which he or she is not entitled.When we sent out the lone parent's circulation to 86,000 people, 2,000 came back. We find that information very useful because it allows us to update our database. Every time we do a mass circulation, we learn something by obtaining new addresses, information on income and so on.I am not aware that there is a problem with electronic funds transfer, but I will take it up with officials in the Department. People increasingly opt for such transfers, including as much as 50% to 60% of new applicants for different schemes. At an overall level, about 30% of applicants avail of electronic funds transfer. We must ensure that controls are in place to check payments. We make 900,000 payments every week and we must keep a tight grip to minimise whatever small proportion of them that goes to those not entitled to them. In the event of fraud, we must take an uncompromising view.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Is the Minister satisfied that the only way to check on the electronic funds transfer method is by mailshot? Does he accept that the 4,500 letters returned last April represent a great number of unaccounted people? Each year, more than 1,000 claims for child benefit are paid for which people do not seem to exist. Is this money retrieved by his Department?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Absolutely. The Department takes a strong line on that. We must distinguish between outright fraud, where people set out to give the Department false information or fail to give information, and genuine departmental errors or errors made by the applicant.The Deputy has regularly asked me about the money we spend on our computer systems. He is probably surprised how significant it is. A huge investment is being made in our computer and control systems to ensure that the €13 billion paid out every year by my Department is tightly controlled and that we learn something from each experience. If 4,500 letters are sent back, it often means a change of address, circumstances or condition. A very small amount might be due to attempted fraud, but we learn from every one. It does not necessarily cost the State money. If the letters are sent back, it often means we do not pay those people the following week because we may have learned that they no longer qualify.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	70	This question relates to a study, the title of which includes the words "Day In, Day Out" which is a good phrase to use in regard to politics.I recently launched the Combat Poverty Agency study on the dynamics of child poverty. The study's key findings are that children tend to move in and out of poverty and that child poverty, and its duration, are affected by a wide range of factors, including the employment, education and health status of parents, and by the number and age of children in the household. The report recommends that the policy response to child poverty should be multi-dimensional in nature and should focus on income supports combined with measures that support employment, education and accessibility of services such as child care and health.The Government has a strategic process in place for combating poverty, including child poverty, in the form of the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion and the national children's strategy. Ending Child Poverty was also one of ten special initiatives under the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. While these elements remain under active progression, I fully expect that the successor to Sustaining Progress and the next NAP/inclusion 2006-08 will add further impetus to the process.It is estimated that some 65,000 children remain in consistent poverty and moving these children out of poverty remains my absolute priority. In this regard, I intend to build on the good progress that has been made thus far. Some 100,000 children have been lifted out of deprivation inside the last decade as a result of targeted measures and supports. The most significant measure my Department has taken in recent years to support families with children has been the very substantial real increases in child benefit rates, of which the Deputies are aware.I have also made substantial improvements to the family income supplement which assists families at work on low pay. Assessment of entitlement to payment is now on the basis of net rather than gross income, while increases in the income limits have made it easier for lower-income households to qualify under the scheme. My Department also undertook a very successful nationwide awareness campaign last March, as was mentioned earlier.In addition to the improvements outlined, budget 2006 contained a range of measures aimed at families with children. More than 350,000 children under six years of age, in 250,000 families, will qualify for the new annual €1,000 early child care supplement which will be paid on an agency basis by my Department. The cost of the supplement will be approximately €360 million in a full year.One of the key tasks in the Ending Child Poverty initiative under Sustaining Progress was to address obstacles to employment for lone parents. As the House is aware, I launched a major Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents. That report puts forward proposals for reforms in this area. These proposals are currently the subject of an extensive consultation process and, as I said previously, I hope to bring forward proposals for legislation in the course of this year.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Preparation of an implementation plan regarding the non-income recommendations of the discussion paper is in progress.The establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children under the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, represents a major reorganisation of policy and services for children that will facilitate the development of a strategic and co-ordinated approach to children policy and the delivery of services both at national and local level.I am confident that, through the targeted measures already being taken by the Government and the initiatives being planned, a decisive and lasting impact will be made in the eradication of child poverty.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	71	A more apt title for the study would be "one day at a time" from the point of view of many young children who are experiencing poverty. Despite our affluence, is it not an indictment of our society that a report from the Combat Poverty Agency tracing a period over six or seven years indicates that just under one fifth of children, or 182,000 children, experience poverty over an extended period of between five and eight years. That illustrates a significant failure to intervene in a focused and targeted way to ensure that statistic becomes obsolete. Income poverty is measured as being below 60% of the median income threshold for society as a whole. Is it not also a fact that the age of children and family size tend to affect the length of time for which a child experiences poverty?Given that a quarter of all our children experience poverty for one to two years and one-fifth remain locked in poverty for between five and eight years, the question must be asked why all those dramatic initiatives, targets and interventions have failed to singularly address an issue that blackens the name of our country across the world? We are now noted to have significant elements of child poverty. What targeted policies will be introduced to arrest and eliminate this trend? One child in poverty is one too many in a country that is awash with cash. Why is this number of children experiencing poverty?The report reveals that a child whose parents did not go to secondary school, in other words, whose education was confined to basic primary level, is 23 times more likely to live in poverty compared to a child whose parents have achieved third level education. Should the focus in this respect not be on education? A multifaceted approach is required to tackle this problem. The welfare benefits and the child care allowances the Minister mentioned are all well and good but they have failed to reach the target. Is it not important to increase access to employment, to remove disincentives and poverty traps, to have more pre-school education and to have affordable child care at pre-school and post school level? We need to target child poverty. In my view and that of the Labour Party, every child has the right to be brought up free from poverty, to enjoy a fulfilling childhood and to realise his or her full potential. That is what the Labour Party believes and that is what should be written into the Constitution if it means anything today.The Minister should use this report. It is useful in that it should enable us to develop policies and measures that target the root causes of poverty. Let us not have only documents on tackling this issue and some social partners coming out and blowing their trumpet about what they have achieved. They have achieved nothing while child poverty is at the current level. Have we a national partnership agreement and, if so, what elements of it will tackle child poverty? What elements of the national anti-poverty strategy will tackle it? What provisions are there in the national development plan to address it?What is needed to tackle this problem is a co-ordinated strategy at Government level, joined-up thinking and joined-up Government. The involvement of the Office of the Minister for Children is required. The Minister for Education and Science has a key role to play in early intervention to support the education and development of young children. The involvement of the Minister's department is critical together with the involvement of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. We need to ensure that the transition from welfare to work is supported to eliminate poverty traps, especially for children of lone parents. We need flexible child care services, education and training supports, flexible employment arrangements and a proper balance between parenting and working. I suggest to the Minister that a co-ordinated approach be adopted to eliminate child poverty once and for all.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	72	I do not disagree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy. My absolute policy priority is child poverty. It is way ahead of all the other responsibilities I have, for which I make no apology, because at the start of the 21st century, as the Deputy said, even one child living in poverty is one child too many.The debate that has been raging about statistics is one with which I must contend every day. The EU SILC survey shows that consistent poverty experienced by children reduced from 12% in 2003 to 9% in 2004, and that was the position two years ago. The best estimate we can give of the position today is a figure of approximately 65,000, but that is 65,000 children too many. However, using exactly the same measure, approximately 100,000 children would have been added to that figure a decade ago. Therefore, we are making solid progress in this area and we need to continue to do so.Child benefit is a major help to families, as are the various schemes available, family income supplement in particular, lone parents allowances — and it was noted there is a prevalence of child poverty in lone parent families. All these allowances are being substantially and steadily increased. Disregards have been put in place as well as a system to encourage and allow people to move from welfare back to work. All these measures are targeted to finally eliminate that scourge from the country.

Before I take it, I wish to advise the House that I do not have a prepared answer for Question No. 48, for which I apologise. There must have been some confusion as a result of a postponement last week, which is totally on my side. I apologise to the House for that and I can deal with this matter at another time.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The Pensions Board was asked to review, in consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the position and regulation of income continuance plans. These products often interact with occupational pension schemes and it was considered necessary to establish the facts of the situation and to clarify the position for the bodies with an interest in this area, namely, my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Pensions Board. The report was compiled by consultants Watson Wyatt and Matheson Ormsby Prentice Solicitors and was published on the Pensions Board website in December 2005.Income continuance plans provide cover to individuals in the event of long-term illness or disability which prohibit the person from following his or her normal occupation. These plans are insurance policies and the financial regulator regulates the providers of the products since May 2003.Different types of products are available in the market — those sold directly to individuals by insurance companies and those that are employer sponsored. I am aware of issues arising with the latter type of product relating to avenues of redress in the event of problems or complaints arising.As the employer is the beneficial owner of the policy underpinning the income continuance arrangement, there is no access for the individual to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The consultants' report suggested that corporate income continuance plans should be brought within the remit of the Insurance Ombudsman, now the Financial Services Ombudsman, and my Department has raised this issue with the Department of Finance with a view to making progress in this area.In general, the report found that lack of adequate disclosure has been the most significant source of misunderstanding in the interaction of income continuance plans and related pension plans. To overcome this it was suggested that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should introduce regulations to improve the flow of information to employees on income continuance arrangements. The consultants have also suggested that guidance notes on disclosure requirements on occupational pensions need to be strengthened to cover some aspects of the income continuance arrangements.In this regard, I have recently signed into force new disclosure of information regulations for occupational pension schemes. The Pensions Board is drafting the guidance notes in respect of these regulations and, in this context, will consider how best to implement the recommendations made in the consultants' report in so far as they relate to pension benefits.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I thank the Minister for his reply which highlights the complexity of the issue. It involves at least one other Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and as it is a financial product, probably the Department of Finance.I agree with the Minister that the matter should be brought under the remit of one Department. However, that does not change the current situation where different Departments have had particular responsibilities for the problem as it has arisen. The situation is obvious with regard to Tara Mines, and at least 3,000 people could be affected by the misapplication of these schemes. Given that these are products that have been linked with occupational pension schemes and that it is a long-standing problem, the Minister and his Department have a direct responsibility. Will he explain how they intend to deal with the problems?It has been indicated that the misapplication of the benefit to the employers as agents could be as high as between €300 million and €500 million, which should have gone directly to workers affected by work related accidents. Given the figure is of that scale, that thousands of people have, potentially, been defrauded, and given the linkage to occupational pension schemes, there is a pressing case for the Department to indicate how it will alleviate the problem in the short term.I welcome the Minister's reply on better disclosure arrangements for occupational pension schemes. It would benefit all of us in the House if the Pensions Board supplied the guidelines to us as soon as possible.Given that this was a bought-in or add-on scheme in terms of private enterprise providing work and pension support for people in specific industries, does the Minister accept that it undermines the scope of his policy direction in which he has been trying to encourage a greater take up of private pension schemes wherever and however possible?

I am anxious that the schemes come under some form of monitoring and regulation. The report recommended that they be brought under the Insurance Ombudsman, now called the Financial Services Ombudsman. My Department and the Department of Finance are discussing how best to make this happen. I support the consultants' suggestion and am of the view that the services must be within the ambit of the Financial Services Ombudsman. We will try to ensure this happens as soon as possible so that the schemes may be overseen.It is worth pointing out that these are not so much pension plans as insurance plans. They insure against a person not being able to continue work in certain circumstances.

They are often a bolt-on product and part of it. However, for the moment we are treating them as insurance products and that is the reason we are considering sending the issue not to the Pensions Ombudsman but to the Financial Services Ombudsman. That is the route we will take and I trust it will make a difference. More than 200,000 people are involved and their interests must be protected. The Financial Services Ombudsman should be in a position to do that.

The Financial Services Ombudsman will deal with the schemes in the future. The 200,000 people on the schemes largely get the service they paid for and those who are not linked to their employer as the agent do not suffer a detriment in the payout likely to accrue to them. However, a cohort of people have been damaged in the past. Regardless of who takes responsibility for the issue in the future, I am concerned that someone should take responsibility for the way these schemes have been misapplied in the past. I want an answer and guidance from the Minister as to what role he can and should play in that.

I will examine whether the ombudsman can play a role with regard to the existing stock, but I doubt we can make much progress in that area because retrospection is difficult when establishing new responsibilities. That said, it may be open to me to ask the ombudsman, when he takes responsibility for the area, to examine what occurred and suggest how we can assist.

Deputies have put the case that, where people with savings from their non-contributory pensions die and their estate is examined, we should find some way to disregard the block of savings which emerges when the estate goes to probate and we discover it.When probate is taken out and the accounts of the deceased are closely examined, substantial so-called savings are often found. The last time I answered this question, I explained the policy and that there is a clawback because the amount of money in the account now shows the person was not entitled to the pension at the time. I cannot change that. An initial examination of the issue showed it was impossible to tell the difference between whether the money in the account was saved from the non-contributory pension or whether it came from some other source. The real issue is whether the money comes from another source such as a small inheritance, a gift or payments from a relative.Ring-fencing this became a major issue. It was decided that we would not depart from the present policy until we had one about which we were very sure-footed. We continue to consider it as asked in Question No. 48.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I thank the Minister for his reply. Perhaps he should come to the House more often without notes. Is the Minister aware of the particular case of Anthony Hennigan that was brought to our attention at committee? Is he aware that a social welfare appeals officer found against the Department in this issue? Is he aware that almost 50% of these cases arose from savings from means-tested pension payments according to an internal memorandum in the Department of Social and Family Affairs? Will the Minister not agree that 50% represents a major issue even though Department officials told me in committee that they did not consider it to be so? Will the Minister confirm that it is the practice to deduct funeral and legal expenses applicable to the estate before an over-payment is calculated? Is he aware that the appeals officer in his report stated that he found no evidence before him of such consideration being given in that case? Will he give an assurance that the correct procedure is being followed in every case?Will the Minister make himself aware of what the appeals officer said about the circumstances of the case with reference to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993, in particular the appeals officer's report that he did not find any significant reference by the deciding officer to the appellant's submissions which relate to the special circumstances of this case? However, he was assured that all the circumstances were fully considered. Will the Minister agree that it is wrong to penalise older people and perhaps their elderly relatives by double assessing their means? In other words after having been assessed for a non-contributory pension, an older person will save up for a rainy day. When such a person passes away a further assessment is made. Does the Minister agree that this is continuing and that the saving threshold from 1977 to 1979 was £200 and from 1979 to 2001 it was £2,000 and that those thresholds are still being applied? I ask the Minister to consider the issue as a matter of urgency and make the necessary changes.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I am not particularly aware of the specific case, but given that the Deputy has raised it, I will make a point of studying it. The Deputy might be aware that I am examining the area of non-contributory policy in any case. As I said to the committee last week, the number of people on non-contributory pensions is reducing each year and obviously those on contributory pensions is increasing correspondingly or even faster. Up to half those on non-contributory pensions are on partial pensions. Enormous effort is going into means testing these and making changes as to the proportion of pension received at every stage. This area needs to be examined and in that context we can review this issue.There is an essential principle in the question asked by the Deputy. As the law stands the existing limits must be applied. If we subsequently discover that the accounts of a deceased person reveal something different from what we had been led to believe five or ten years earlier, it cannot be ignored under the present law. As I have said many times, I am very keen to examine the operation of non-contributory pensions as those on such pensions end up worse off than contributory pensioners. While contributory pensioners must contribute to the fund, there is no means test and they can earn what they wish. They are entitled to have other pensions. Whereas the dwindling brigade of non-contributory pensioners find that we means test very severely and although in the budget I increased the amount they can earn, they do not have the facility to earn additional funds. I have commenced the process of examining that area in recent weeks. Regarding this claw-back, we would be happy to examine any proposals on how to ring-fence such savings and confirm and verify them. It would be extremely difficult and I have no such proposals at present.

If all the payments come from means-tested payments, that should not lead to a claw-back in most cases.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	93	Since 1997, with the first national anti-poverty strategy, the Government has adopted a strategic approach to reduce and eliminate poverty. The need for a strategic approach reflects the complex nature of poverty which is multi-faceted in its causes and effects, and, as a consequence, requires a multi-policy response.It has been a priority of successive governments to reduce and, if possible, eliminate basic poverty. To measure progress in achieving this objective, the consistent poverty indicator was devised by the ESRI. The numbers experiencing consistent poverty is calculated by identifying, from among those at risk of poverty, those deprived of at least one good or service considered essential for a basic standard of living in Ireland today. The data for this indicator are obtained from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions, EU-SILC.The survey in 2003 showed a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate, from 8.8% in 2003 to 6.8% in 2004 continuing a downward trend over the period since 1997. The low levels of unemployment and the substantial resources devoted to social welfare and other social services, which have been increasing in real terms, are bringing about this downward trend. Analysis suggests that 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, have been lifted out of deprivation and hardship since 1997 as a result of the concentrated and targeted measures and supports.The Government is committed to continuing these policies. It is simply not possible to say with confidence, however, especially in light of methodological and measurement issues, when the policies will result in consistent poverty being fully eliminated. The level of consistent poverty will continue to be measured under EU-SILC which will enable us to monitor the progress being made and to apply extra resources and revised policies to meet the overall goal.The "at risk of poverty" indicator is one of the common indicators agreed at EU level. It measures the numbers with incomes below 60% of median income for the whole population. Paradoxically, the numbers below this "at risk of poverty" threshold have increased in recent years despite the significant improvement in real terms of incomes across the board. This has been due to the major increase in the incomes of the population as a whole, arising from more and better employment and lower tax levels. Other key factors are the major reduction in unemployment and increased employment participation.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Those most at risk of poverty are families with children, particularly lone parents and larger families, people with disabilities and older persons living alone. A key policy objective is to remove barriers to employment for those capable of employment and provide the supports they need to obtain employment, such as education, training and child care. A discussion paper on ways of meeting these challenges for lone parents and other low-income families with children is being considered.A decrease in the "at risk of poverty" rate from 19.7% in 2003 to 19.4% in 2004 was recorded by EU-SILC and shows that existing policies are beginning to have an effect on this indicator. Given the dependence of this indicator on the movement of incomes generally and their volatility over recent years, it is difficult to set targets for a reduction in numbers classified as at risk of poverty under this measure, or state when poverty classified in this way will be eliminated.The main purpose of indicators is to identify clearly those who are most deprived and vulnerable in society and the progress being made in improving their position. These issues are currently being addressed in the preparation of the next national action plan against poverty and social exclusion, being co-ordinated by the office for social inclusion in my Department, which is due to be finalised by September.I am confident that, through the targeted measures being taken by the Government and the initiatives being planned, a decisive and lasting impact will be made in the eradication of poverty.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	94	We have attended launches of many different reports in recent years. The reality is that those on welfare, those from the Traveller community, those leaving school early, homeless people, those with a disability, elderly people and lone parents are more likely to be poor than wealthy. I attended a recent launch at which the Minister claimed all the reports are complete and it is now time for action, on which we all agree. The Minister spoke about 65,000 children living in consistent poverty in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The Government agreed that by 2007 it would eradicate consistent poverty or reduce the consistent poverty rate to 2% and make a decisive impact on the eradication of relative poverty. Is it on course to achieve this commitment?Ireland has the highest level of relative poverty in the European Union and child poverty rates are among the highest in the OECD. Does the Minister accept that in 2004 almost one in five of the population was living in relative poverty and approximately 7% of the population was living in consistent poverty? The benefits of economic growth are not trickling down and our performance in wealth distribution has been shameful. Using consistent poverty measures, the Combat Poverty Agency estimates that 150,000 children suffer deprivation. The figures and methods used to calculate consistent poverty are to be changed. Will this involve playing with the figures?The most recent European Union survey on income and living conditions, which was published in December 2005, found that 19.4% of the population was living in relative poverty. Barnardos has indicated that one in seven children live in poverty. It is shameful that any child should live in poverty in such a rich country. Moreover, one in three children from disadvantaged areas has problems with reading and writing. I am concerned that a large cohort of people has been excluded from society. One in three children in disadvantaged areas leaves school without a qualification such as the leaving certificate and only one in 100 children from disadvantaged backgrounds are given an opportunity to engage in out-of-school activities, despite their proven development benefits.A wide range of reports and analyses have been produced and policies have been introduced to address child poverty. Is the Government on target to eradicate poverty and remove 65,000 children from consistent poverty? When will this goal be achieved? Will it be in our lifetime or will another generation be stuck in poverty as the figures and research available would suggest? Resources are still not being pumped into disadvantaged areas and children are still leaving school early. Given that education is one of the keys to eliminating poverty, why is the necessary investment not coming on stream?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	95	With more than 1 million children living in this country, one must approach the figure of 65,000 with caution. A series of debates is taking place on how to measure poverty. The ESRI produced a list of eight basic deprivation indicators, including not having a roast or its equivalent once a week; not having a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day; having to go without heating due to lack of money at some point in the year; not having a substantial meal on one day in the previous two weeks; and experiencing debt problems arising from ordinary living expenses.While these indicators point to deprivation, in certain circumstances some of the measures more closely describe lifestyle than deprivation. When we talk about relative poverty we are really talking about lifestyle as opposed to poverty as we know it. My target is to eradicate consistent poverty, which affects 65,000 people, as quickly as I can. I cannot give a timeframe within which this goal will be achieved, except to repeat a figure I gave in answer to an earlier question. In a ten year period 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, were lifted out of poverty. This shows the pace at which progress has been made. We need to dramatically accelerate progress and are doing so through substantial increases in social welfare payments. In the past five or six years, expenditure on direct social welfare benefits has increased from €7 billion to €13 billion, the bulk of which is directed towards helping the vulnerable and those on means tested schemes. A substantial portion of these moneys is paid to low income families through family income supplement and other schemes. I will continue to work on the second tier concept and hope to have a version ready soon which will target available funds at children in consistent poverty.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	96	The construction federation operatives pensions scheme operates as a registered employment agreement under the Industrial Relations Acts. There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and pay the necessary contributions. Since its inception in 1965, the scheme was a defined benefit scheme with flat rate contributions and benefits, which could only be indexed by direct agreement between unions and employers each year. It is understood that after an extended review process between employers and unions, it has been agreed to introduce a new scheme, the terms of which were registered with the Labour Court on 19 May 2006 under the requirements of the registered employment agreement.Generally speaking, I do not favour the replacement of defined benefit schemes with defined contribution arrangements because defined benefit provision best serves the interests of employees. While the Government has been critical of high profile and profitable enterprises which have chosen to close their defined benefit arrangements to new staff, the position of the construction industry scheme is different in a number of respects. First, it appears the changes proposed have been agreed between the parties concerned after prolonged review and discussion, with an agreement registered with the Labour Court. Second, the benefits available under the old scheme were flat rate payments which, unlike most defined benefit arrangements, were not related to previous earnings. The value of these benefits has also been eroded over the years as a result of the non-indexation of benefits and contributions.While the previous scheme had been a defined benefit scheme, the scheme sponsors consider that the new scheme will be more beneficial to scheme members for a number of reasons including that contributions to the scheme will be higher; a retiring worker will have an option to take 25% of his accumulated fund as a lump sum, whereas heretofore the lump sum paid was equivalent to about one year's pension, which was up to €4,500; annuities will be provided in-house rather than buying them on the open market, which will give better value for accumulated funds; death in service benefits will be better as spouses will receive not only the €63,500 lump sum available at present but also the accumulated value of the individual's pension fund; workers will have choices in how to apply their accumulated funds ranging from a fixed pension with no indexation and no surviving spouse's benefit to an indexed pension indexed at 3% per annum with a 50% surviving spouse's pension; and where a member's remaining fund, after taking his or her 25% tax free lump sum, is less than €15,000, the member will be offered the option to fully commute his or her pension to a lump sum payment.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Occupational pensions in Ireland are voluntary arrangements and, as such, employers can change the terms of these arrangements. I am aware there are many pressures on defined benefit schemes emanating from the need to pre-fund and meet the requirements of accounting standards FRS17 and the funding standard under the Pensions Act. While some employers have taken unilateral action to change their pension schemes, the changes proposed in the construction industry scheme have been agreed after extensive discussions and it appears the change may be to the advantage of workers in the industry.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Is the Minister satisfied that the construction industry has thus far complied with its obligations under what is a registered employment agreement, a sacrosanct agreement between workers and employers? Is he satisfied with the level of transparency in the current scheme? Last year, SIPTU was compelled to raise significant concerns regarding the operation of the industry confederation's pension scheme which did not cover up to 50% of the relevant workers. Should the Minister not have been concerned that workers who work hard from early morning until late at night were not covered by their pension scheme? Ultimately, employers benefit most from the work of their employees and generally get fat on the backs of working people rather than from materials. I understand 80,000 of a membership of 120,000 contributed to the scheme.Is the Minister satisfied the new scheme will ensure the registration of all employees, the proper payment of deducted contributions and the eradication of the unethical practices about which the Pensions Ombudsman, Mr. Kenny, complained last year? Too many employers force their workers to pretend they are self-employed — C45 men and women — in order to circumvent PAYE regulations intended to ensure employees are paid benefits when they become sick or retire. It is time to call a halt to those who are eager to exploit the Celtic tiger. Is the Minister satisfied that such exploitation will not be possible under the new scheme?A matter pertaining to defined benefit pensions was brought to my attention by a person in Cork. Some trustees of schemes claim to be entitled to override the rules of schemes by the application of section 48(3) of the Pensions Act 1990. Is it not important that Acts passed by this sovereign Parliament do not allow anybody to override any part of the deeds of a trust? Section 48(3) of the Pensions Act should be examined in that context.

Currently, approximately 65,000 people are in the scheme, while 80,000 are eligible to join it. Deputies will be aware that a high degree of self-employment exists within the industry, which in itself causes further difficulties.I have suggested that employers who do not remit funds or comply with legislation should not be awarded State contracts and I continue to hold that view. I have held discussions with the Minister for Finance in that regard and understand he is planning to introduce new standard contracts for public sector building projects later this year. These contracts will require contractors to ensure pay and conditions of employment fully comply with the law and that pension terms are no less favourable than the pension terms included in the registered employment agreement. Combined with the new pension scheme, the contracts will be of considerable benefit to the industry.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

This week, another murder took place, the third in a small area and the sixth in north Dublin this year, most of which have occurred in Kilbarrack, Donaghmede and Coolock. In parts of Dublin, the Glock is now the weapon of choice for executions. This city is awash with handguns which can be bought for a couple of hundred euro. The price of a gun now equates to the price of a human life.The Government has failed to tackle the epidemic of handgun crime in this State. Fine Gael supported the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in drafting new legislation and has offered to support initiatives on a gun amnesty but there is still no sign of the implementation of such an amnesty. On 8 March, I offered to introduce a stand alone firearms Bill which would provide more serious penalties for gun crimes. That offer was refused and the consequence of the Government's complacency can be seen in the appalling murder and execution rates in north Dublin. Had that legislation been fast-tracked and the amnesty been implemented, gardaí would have been given a stronger legislative basis on which to perform their duty.Since 1998, 108 people have been killed by guns in this country. Fewer than one fifth of these deaths have resulted in convictions. Last March, the Taoiseach claimed in this House that crime is not out of control. Does he now believe crime is not out of control? Does he think the good people of Kilbarrack, Donaghmede and Coolock believe crime is under control? Does he think the people of Ireland believe that?Can he outline the specific actions he now proposes to take in response to this wave of handgun crime and a murder rate that is reaching epic proportions? Does it not bring home the truth highlighted in the words of the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, when he said: "this is the worst Government in the history of the State"? The Government has no plan and nothing ever works.

It has always been that way and it will continue to be so. That does not only hold true for this country but for every western democracy. We have to keep dealing with the small but vicious and ruthless group of criminals who are involved in this. They will resort to any kind of action and the many murders in north Dublin and the greater Dublin area are part of this. We continue to prioritise the fight against criminals and to deal with this issue.This morning the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform briefed me on his meeting yesterday with Commissioner Conroy and Deputy Commissioner Murphy. He set out how the significant resources of the Garda Síochána are being deployed to tackle gangland crime. He emphasised that the Garda Síochána did not have any resource or legislative problem in its efforts to deploy gardaí and equip them to address the challenges of crime.Commissioner Conroy also briefed the Minister in considerable detail on the investigations into the 29 murders in 2006, 13 of which involved a firearm. Some 20 of these cases have been solved and files have been sent or are being prepared to be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions. With regard to the other nine murders the commissioner updated the Minister on the investigations and briefed him on the issues that arise in these cases. A small number of criminals are prepared to take any action they deem necessary to protect their position, including extreme violence and murder. We continue to give top priority to targeting organised crime.Regarding gun crime, under Operation Anvil the Garda Síochána has confiscated an enormous number of guns and handguns. Guns can be obtained cheaply in this jurisdiction or others and the latest figures available show that since the introduction of Operation Anvil, some 527 firearms have been seized resulting in 2,830 arrests for serious crimes, 43 arrests in connection with murders in the Dublin metropolitan region and 1,298 individuals being charged to date under Operation Anvil. These figures are impressive. Gardaí cannot be at every house on every corner and in every lane and if serious criminals attempt to take each other out, the Garda Síochána must continue to carry out painstaking investigations into it. Every time a murder is committed, more detectives are assigned to the case and removed from preventative work.The Minister asked if there were outstanding legislative issues, other than the passing of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which everyone is committed to passing in this session. The Garda Síochána has the manpower and it must attempt to break these vicious gangs. It has broken many over the past years. Our work is to support the Garda Síochána in breaking these gangs because they are unlikely to listen to anything else.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	105	One of the principal reasons these people who have no respect for life or limb continue to do as they do is that they believe they will not be caught. The annual rate of murder has increased by 42% since the current Government took office in 1997. Teacher unions have reported that teachers are threatened with handguns. Headline crime detection rates have fallen in each of the past four years. These are serious crimes including murder, rape, aggravated assault, burglary and theft. Some 100,000 such crimes are committed every year on the watch of the absent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. If he survives until next year he will have presided over 500,000 such crimes. After the tragic murder of the innocent bystander Donna Cleary, he stated that it was a watershed in crime. What resources have been put in place to convince the nation that it was a watershed? What evidence shows that her death brought about a watershed in crime detection, handgun crime and the wave of handgun purchases to execute people, which resulted in the murder of innocent people?The Minister agreed to set up a special Garda gangland unit last year to tackle the spiralling rate of crime. How many officers serve in it and what resources are available to it? What is the programme for the gangland special unit and what are its results to date, given that only 17% of those who committed crimes have had convictions against them? A crime is not solved until a conviction is brought.Last week I met the president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Three gardaí are attending on McCabe scholarships. They have ample experience in successfully dealing with this kind of gangland crime and murder in cities across the United States. In briefing the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government, is it not time the Garda authorities ensured such expertise is brought to areas of this city where people are terrified that this type of gangland crime will walk in the door, uninvited, resulting in more murders of innocent people? It is time the Government focused on this issue and dealt with it.

We must not portray crime levels as being at the same level as in New York state. Our numbers are high but have not changed much in recent years. Headline crimes may have approached 500,000 in the past five years but the figures for headline crime were the same some years previously. That is a hopeless argument for us to discuss. In 1996, 1997 and every year since there have been 100,000 such crimes but that is not the issue. The Garda Síochána is better resourced, with better laws and equipment. It deals with 500,000 more people and crime rates have reduced when measured per 1,000 people. The Garda Síochána is dealing with vicious people fighting over their patch for drugs and related issues.

When some of these individuals have been shot, suffering serious injuries, they still will not speak or assist in any way with the investigation. That makes the task of the Garda Síochána more difficult in securing prosecutions. Some 20 of the 29 murders this year have been solved from the point of view of the Garda Síochána. Once the file is sent to the DPP, the work of the Garda Síochána is done. We must have prosecutions and in the remaining nine cases under investigation, most concern gangland crimes. We are fast approaching a force of 14,000 gardaí with major resources. The addition for overtime will allow gardaí to work on weekends on various missions under dedicated forces.People have information and those who can help the Garda Síochána to break into a small number of gangs involved in one area in north Dublin should try to assist the Garda processes as outlined.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	111	On the latest developments on electronic voting, two Ministers persisted with the purchase of equipment costing €52 million that has never been used in a general or local election. That is €52 million of taxpayers' money down the drain in one of the biggest examples of waste by this Government.It is worth recalling that a number of experts outside this House warned both former Ministers with this responsibility, Deputies Noel Dempsey and Cullen, about the disastrous road on which they were embarked, but they dismissed and ignored that advice. They ignored the request for an all-party committee that warned that this would be the logical conclusion of where they were going. Then the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, thought up the bright idea and his successor, Deputy Cullen, insisted on implementing it, no matter what the objections or reservations on this side of the House and no matter what the expert evidence submitted by people outside this House.After wasting €52 million of taxpayers' money, we now find it is costing us just short of €700,000 per annum to store these machines the present Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, has said will not be used in the next general election. That same Minister has mooted the idea of storing these machines centrally and has found out that we will have to pay a ransom of millions to buy out the leases committed to for the storage of machines we will never use. In County Monaghan, the returning officer has entered into a lease for 25 years at €25,865 per annum, although the lifetime of the machine is 20 years.

Will he abandon this crazy scheme and see if he can find anybody gullible enough anywhere in the western world to take the machines off his hands? Does the Taoiseach agree with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that they will not be used in the next general election? Does he agree that nothing symbolises the incompetence and waste of this Government like the debacle of e-voting?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	114	There are a number of points. People used the machines in the previous general election. There was no controversy leading up to the election about using electronic voting. In fact, the demonstrations that were held for young and old alike, in urban and rural areas, were highly successful and the acceptance rate of the machines in the election was high among those who used them.People subsequently expressed some views about the speed and the process of how the voting should be done on a slower basis. It was long after that political controversy raged on this issue, when would-be experts — I do not know if they are experts — raised issues about this. Following that, it was agreed that we would set up a Commission on Electronic Voting, which has done a considerable amount of work and research analysing both the hardware and the software and which is due to report this summer.Voting is a fundamental part of a democracy. If there is not agreement and if people who were in favour of electronic voting have subsequently changed their minds or have become convinced that, unlike the rest of the world, we should have a paper trail or that perhaps we still want to use pens and pencils to vote when the rest of world is moving on——

We must wait for the report to be published. I still hold the view it is a pity that the country that has continually the highest rate of software exports in the world is refusing to use electronic voting, even when we have gone through an international process resulting in using a company that is held in high regard and does not have a difficulty in other democracies.

The Commission on Electronic Voting issued a report that was damning in its criticism of the system the Taoiseach now seeks to give the impression was only objected to by the Opposition. While he dismisses so-called experts, those so-called experts were vindicated. They, like this party, opposed the system from the very beginning, explained why, relied on evidence from experts and, unlike this Government which is out of touch, did not dismiss them out of hand.The Taoiseach is interested only in the Government saving face on this debacle while taxpayers are interested only in saving money. He wasted €52 million of taxpayers' money. He is paying almost €700,000 to store the machines. We now find that we will have to pay millions to buy out the storage leases for machines that we will never use.I ask the Taoiseach again whether we will use them in the next general election because while his answer was that he agreed with his Minister that we will not use them, he added that we must wait for the report from the commission. Are we or are we not going to use them? By the time the editors get to work and finesse that English, it will be qualified. Can we have a "yes" or "no"? Are we going to use them in the next election or not?

Nothing the Taoiseach has done symbolises more the waste and incompetence associated with his decision making than this issue.

What is the point in comparisons with other democracies with first-past-the-post systems? This system was examined by experts and found wanting. That is the position and there is no point saying that if only X and Y had happened, we could have proceeded with it. What will the Taoiseach do about it now? Is there any prospect of selling the machines to anyone? Will we pay a ransom to people for leases to store machines that are worthless?

What is the Government doing to address the crisis in these services highlighted in the report and the crisis faced by victims because of the limited services available? A fortnight has barely passed since the legal and political system in this jurisdiction was thrown into turmoil as a result of a Supreme Court decision. However, the issue of the lack of services and supports for the victims of sexual crime was not addressed. There is a bounden duty on the Taoiseach to address them.Given the report has been available since last November, what has the Taoiseach and his Government been doing in the meantime to ensure the implementation of its recommendations? What is his plan? How many recommendations have been acted on by Government? Against the backdrop of the recent crisis, which quite correctly occupied the mind of every citizen, what has the Government done and what does it intend to do to ensure the crisis in these services is addressed effectively?Is the Taoiseach aware that the treatment centre for the victims of sexual assault in Dublin, based at the Rotunda Hospital in his constituency, undertakes 300 forensic examinations annually, yet it cannot cope because of a shortage of staff and total under-resourcing? This is also reflected in the other service centres in Waterford, Letterkenny and Cork. Only the latter receives direct Government funding as a result of a decision by a former Minister for Health and Children from the area. Special treatment centres for the victims of sexual assault are not directly funded by Government, they are totally under-resourced and under-staffed and they are incapable of addressing the current crisis. Will the Taoiseach outline the actions he and his Government intend to take to address this serious flaw in service provision in this State?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I understand the report is being implemented and all the relevant agencies have been involved in its implementation. The resourcing for this was reflected in the Book of Estimates. The Health Service Executive has been involved in providing services and I am not sure what crisis the Deputy is talking about. Perhaps he is referring to the Rape Crisis Centre's engagement with the Minster of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, regarding additional resources. I met a delegation from the centre late last year or early this year regarding a number of issues. However, the professional and counselling services, which provide help and support to victims, are in place. I am sure the Ministers involved are dealing with the new recommendations. I am not clear what part of the service the Deputy is referring to. The report was based on improving and enhancing these services and that is being implemented. The Rape Crisis Centre has sought additional resources and I have been engaged with the Minister and the Department on that issue.

The report, following on from the review, highlights a real crisis, with people who have the courage to come forward as victims of sexual assault finding the services they need are not in place. The lack of availability of trained doctors and forensic nurse examiners is a real crisis. Insufficient qualified personnel are available to carry out the necessary examinations.The crisis is such in the Taoiseach's constituency that, unless a victim initiates a prosecution through the Garda, he or she will only be seen by appointment. Surely that is unacceptable. The report states that such is the fall-down in service provision in this area, victims are being dissuaded — this is the language used — from coming forward and pressing charges against predators and those who initiated these assaults.This is a serious situation. The Taoiseach asked to what crisis I was referring. We have heard that response to other issues applying in society. There is a real crisis and a bounden responsibility on him and his colleagues to become au fait with what is recommended and to ensure it is implemented as a matter of urgency. Will the Taoiseach implement in full the recommendations of the review which was sponsored by two Departments?

There is a difficulty, as I pointed to the Deputy recently regarding another service, in sourcing staff for professional and technical posts. There is a necessity to recruit highly trained professional staff and we have been recruiting such staff from abroad because we do not have sufficient numbers in this State. We have tried to increase the number of therapists in a number of areas to meet our needs. If aspects of this report show there are new heights to which we must bring the service, in order to try to improve it and have more centres, I am sure that such an objective will be examined in the process of preparing estimates to provide this centre. However——

As for professional services, any report that examines this area will always show that one can do better in this regard and that one should have more centres, counselling and therapy available. Thereafter, people will use such services more and this is what I understand my colleagues to have been endeavouring to do in conjunction with the Health Service Executive.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the recent surveys conducted at St. James's Hospital, which have shown that as many as 15%, or 50,000 of those teenagers under 18 years of age who have been screened at clinics have been found to have a sexually transmitted disease, many of whom will be unaware there is a problem; the need for major spending to tackle the problem identified by a leading expert at the hospital because, due to pressure on the service, people are being turned away at present; and, given the recent legislation passed, the possibility that teenage boys will no longer present for screening, which will result in their health being put at risk, as well as additions to the cycle of infection.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the proposal of the Health Service Executive to centralise all tertiary care in the north-eastern region into Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda within three months; the absence of facilities to deal with the increased load on the staff in Drogheda; the absence of advanced paramedics or ambulances which would also put the population at serious risk; and the need to recognise that this constitutes an overall national plan which the HSE intends to deliver and which will have a serious effect on smaller hospitals.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a matter of national importance, namely, the reply given in the Dáil by the Minister for Education and Science to the Labour Party spokesperson on education, Deputy O'Sullivan, which showed that nationally, the teacher-pupil ratio is at an alarmingly high level and that in particular, the pupil-teacher ratio in County Kildare shows that nearly 30% or 6,351 national school children in the county are in classes of 30 to 34 pupils, and that 531 pupils are in classes of 35 to 39; and to enable the Minister to inform the Dáil how she proposes to keep her promise to reduce all class sizes to 20 pupils per class and to remove Ireland from the invidious position of having the second largest class sizes in Europe with the second lowest expenditure on national primary education in the EU.

Is the proposal for dealing with the late sitting agreed? Agreed. Is the proposal for dealing with No. 12, motion re Revised Estimates for the Public Service 2006 without debate agreed? Agreed.I call Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Is the Bill that is before the Seanad at present in respect of home defence a Government Bill, or is it a Bill from the Government's junior party?I have raised the matter of SI 170 of 2000 and SI 171 of 2000 on three previous occasions. They deal with the transfer of property rights and liabilities Order of 2000 for the National Rehabilitation Board. A total of 184 staff were employed there and pension rights were due to them.

The first question referred to a Bill before the Seanad which is not appropriate to the Order of Business in this House.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I asked the Taoiseach when can we expect to have this report published. It used to be done in-house by the public service but not now. It deals with the competency of spoken Irish in primary schools.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Subject to correction, my belief is that it is due shortly. I will confirm that for Deputy Kenny. I was told it was almost ready two or three weeks ago. The other Bill is a Private Members' Bill of an individual Senator. It is not a Government Bill.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	184	On that point, does the Taoiseach know whether the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had anything to do with the paternity of that Bill?

Everyone, including the media, has received this report except Members of this House. I keep being told by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that it will be out soon. Whatever is going on, two months later one cannot get a look at the report.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Regarding the Dalton report I understand the due process based on the accusations and allegations is almost complete and it should be with the Government next week.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Will the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 be re-introduced as new legislation? It seems to be stuck. If the name of Comhairle changes and other changes are considered, will a new Bill be introduced? For a Bill which deals with information, it seems to be full of mystery. I wonder whether it should be called the faoi rún Bill rather than the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill. It must come before the House unless a new Bill is planned.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	191	This refers to a disability advocacy Bill which has cleared Cabinet and should be published in approximately a week.

It would require the mandatory introduction of individual educational programmes for children with learning difficulties, including dyslexia. Early intervention is absolutely essential in these cases. Schools do not implement the Act even though it is departmental policy without the order being made by the Minister. We are waiting two years for it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I will communicate with the Deputy.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This Bill represents the sixth major legislative initiative in as many years to underpin and promote road safety. That legislative progression has seen the introduction of penalty points, a new system for the independent licensing of taxis, hackneys and limousines, a new structure of speed limits based on metric values and, most recently, the establishment of the Road Safety Authority.Deputies have expressed an interest in and concern about road safety issues generally and were particularly concerned about the high level of deaths and injuries on our roads. The Government shares this concern. Many of the issues raised by Deputies during debates and discussions in this House are now reflected in provisions promoted in the Bill.The ongoing progression of road traffic legislation reflects both a response to the changing environment in which we use our roads and an increase in the number of vehicles using our roads. The scope and level of investment in the modernisation of our road network in the past ten years, allied to programmes for the improvement in the design, construction and performance of vehicles, has given rise to an ongoing need for an appropriate legislative response. However, the most significant driver of the process of legislative modernisation has been the need to augment and enhance existing road safety provisions.The debate on road safety has become the centre of political, media and public attention and it is a central and immediate element of our national consciousness. There is understandable and significant disquiet over the number of deaths and injuries as a result of road collisions. A deeply moving and thought-provoking series of articles currently running in The Irish Times presents in graphic detail the grim reality of the human consequences of collisions.The promotion of legislation to support road safety initiatives represents an important response by Government and the Oireachtas to the need for the ongoing advancement of improved safety performance. This, allied with consistent and effective enforcement of the traffic laws promulgated in such legislation, the promotion of road user education and awareness and programmes to promote the formation of drivers, provides the bedrock for the application of the measures that stem from legislative initiatives and ensures the effectiveness and relevance of such initiatives.In Ireland, as in many other states, the force that binds the various road safety measures and programmes into a cohesive policy framework can be found in the road safety strategies. Adopted in the first instance eight years ago, the strategies have provided the basis for the development of a range of legislative and other responses promoted in the meantime. The current strategy forms the policy framework from which the major initiatives proposed in the Bill can be traced.In adopting our road safety strategy we learned from the experience of states such as the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, which are the leading states in the European Union in terms of road safety performance. We have also adopted an approach that has seen the engagement of all the organisations that contribute to the various elements of road safety policy in the identification and pursuit of the policies through which the overall targets can be achieved. The collective goal of all of those involved in the promotion and delivery of road safety policies is to ensure the improvements achieved are sustained and built on.The number of people being killed and injured on our roads is at an unacceptably high level. I will not hide my personal concern over the road death trends that have become established over the past two years. Three hundred and ninety-nine people lost their lives on Irish roads in 2005 and the upward trend continues with 185 dead up to 19 June this year. This represents an increase of 11 over the figure for this day last year. However, the House will recall the prediction made in the first road safety strategy that if the Government did not determine that a strategy to provide for the co-ordination of actions across a range of disciplines should be pursued, road deaths would amount to approximately 550 in 2002. A continuation of what was termed in that strategy a "business as usual" approach would at this stage have resulted in over 600 road deaths per annum. While we cannot be content with the current trends in road collisions, it must be recalled that our road safety record is now significantly more advanced than would have been the case if the Government had not adopted a strategic approach.Through the adoption of road safety strategies we have seen the identification of a series of significant and, in many instances, linked measures that have to date and will continue in the future to advance the safety message for all road users. One of the great advantages of adopting strategies is that they place our plans in the public domain, thus allowing for informed debate that in turn provides a benchmark of public, media and political opinion for the delivery of the measures that have been identified.That process of public and political scrutiny of the first road safety strategy gave rise to the identification of many of the policy options identified in the second strategy, which is now in its final year. There was a significant acknowledgement in that strategy that delivery on its extensive range of initiatives would take until the period to which it applies, that is, until the end of 2006. A planning horizon of just three years for a strategy is relatively short, particularly when compared to the EU road safety strategy, which is based on a ten-year timeframe. The current national strategy was envisaged as a mechanism through which very significant measures would be put into play.The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users. Positively influencing such behaviour is at the centre of our road safety programmes and forms the primary focus of our road safety strategies. Behaviour is influenced positively through initiatives across a number of areas. One of these is the promulgation and enforcement of laws that promote good road user behaviour. Such laws must also be underpinned and supported by the application of fines, prison sentences and driving disqualifications that collectively create an appropriate deterrent to those who endanger the lives of others by their failure to acknowledge and comply with the appropriate behavioural norms.In the area of legislation, as promoted in the current strategy, we have already seen the implementation of the new system of speed limits based on metric values, the extensive roll-out of the penalty points system and the allied system of fixed charges, the administration of which is being outsourced so as to relieve the Garda of administrative functions. The establishment of both the national Garda traffic corps and the Road Safety Authority have become a reality and the contribution of both of those organisations will, I am sure, have a profoundly positive effect on road safety in future.The immediate focus of the Bill is to support the introduction of legislation that will enable the delivery of the remaining outstanding legislative initiatives identified in the national road safety strategy.In general terms, the Bill seeks to address the issue of the adoption of a system of mandatory roadside breath testing for drink driving, introduces an administrative alternative to a court hearing for certain drink driving offences, introduces a new legislative basis for a prohibition on the use of mobile phones, allows for the engagement of private sector interests in the provision and operation of safety equipment and promotes a range of initiatives relating to driver formation. All of those issues stem directly from commitments given in the road safety strategy. Experience in recent years indicates other legislative initiatives were needed to address, in particular, the need to further advance the range and effectiveness of deterrents against the commission of traffic offences. This is also addressed in the Bill.I will refer in some detail to the main provisions proposed in the Bill. Driving under the influence of alcohol is recognised as one of the most serious contributory factors in road collisions. Evidence shows that drink driving is increasing in the younger age groups. There is widespread acceptance among responsible motorists and society as a whole that driving under the influence of alcohol is potentially dangerous and unacceptable. Despite high-publicity, targeted campaigns, some drivers are not willing to change their behaviour. The level of deaths on our roads will not decrease unless strong legislative measures are adopted and enforced to bring about the necessary attitudinal change.The primary target of the road safety strategy commits the Government to the introduction of a form of roadside breath testing which would address, in a positive way, the problem of driving under the influence of alcohol.The first road safety strategy did not include a commitment to introduce random breath testing. However the high-level group on road safety, which was tasked with the preparation and delivery of both road safety strategies, presented the adoption of random breath testing as a recommendation in the second strategy. Section 4 of this Bill responds to the recommendation of the high-level group and promotes the concept of mandatory alcohol testing.The concept of mandatory alcohol testing has been the subject of lengthy consideration and consultation, which included a very significant engagement by the Office of the Attorney General, supported by independent legal advice. The aim of that consideration was to see the introduction of a system through which motorists could be made subject to a requirement to submit to a preliminary breath test without there being any prior suspicion that alcohol had been consumed or that the behaviour of the motorist warranted that a test be administered. The determination of the legislative provisions necessary to support the proposed scheme has been an extensive process in order to strike the appropriate balance between the rights of the individual and the service of the common good by the adoption of a measure that will enhance road safety.The section provides that the establishment of check points for mandatory alcohol tests can only be pursued on the specific written authorisation of an officer of the Garda not below the rank of inspector. That authorisation must be in writing and must clearly establish the place, date and times of day when the check point may be operated. It is envisaged that the Garda Commissioner will establish guidelines to assist and inform all members of the force in the carrying out of their roles in regard to the operation of mandatory alcohol tests. This initiative is an additional measure to the range of existing provisions that apply in respect of the operation of preliminary roadside breath testing for alcohol.The advancement of mandatory roadside testing for alcohol will provide for the first time a means for the detection of drink driving offences that is based exclusively on the level of alcohol consumption as opposed to a motorist's behaviour. If motorists choose to continue to drink and drive, the introduction of mandatory alcohol testing will inevitably result in further increases in the levels of detection. In recognition of this, the Bill promotes an alternative option to a court hearing for those charged with the commission of certain drink driving offences.Mandatory roadside testing in other countries, where it is not required to form an opinion as to whether alcohol has been consumed, has proved itself as an enforcement tool capable of changing attitudes towards drinking and driving. It aims to provide a clear and consistent message to drivers that drink driving is a dangerous and unacceptable activity.The introduction of the new system combined with rigorous publicity and enforcement should result in the level of general deterrence needed to address drink driving in a robust way, bringing about the change in attitudes and behaviour that is necessary to reduce fatalities on our roads.Section 5 provides for the introduction of a new system of fixed charges for certain drink driving offences, the payment of which will lead to the imposition of a fixed period of disqualification. The section provides that where a motorist has been detected with a level of not more than 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, or the equivalent levels in urine or breath, he or she will be offered the opportunity to pay a fixed charge of €300 and accept a driving disqualification of six months. Payment of the charge will be voluntary on behalf of the accused person. If the charge is not paid, however, court proceedings will be instigated. The consequences of a conviction in court will be significantly more onerous as a result of other initiatives being promoted in this Bill, which I will refer to later.The offer of paying a fixed charge will only be available to those who have not been convicted of a drink driving offence in the previous five years and the offer will only be made once to any motorist in any period of five years.The advent of the new system for administrative disqualification for certain drink driving offences places in the spotlight the range of mandatory disqualifications currently applied under the Road Traffic Acts. The immediate consequence of the decision to apply an administrative disqualification of six months to a specific group of drink driving offences means that the periods for minimum disqualifications that apply following convictions for drink driving offences generally required review. The result of that review is set out in section 6.The process of that review established that there was a need to look critically at the overall range of minimum disqualifications that are currently applied in respect of the more serious offences created under the Road Traffic Acts. The disqualifications in question are known as consequential disqualifications as they are applied as a consequence of a conviction for an offence. The range of offences to which this system applies was last set out in the Road Traffic Act 1994. That Act, with an amendment promoted through the Road Traffic Act 1995 in respect of certain drink driving offences, also establishes the minimum periods for such disqualifications.Given the much higher profile that applies to road safety now and accepting that there is a broad consensus for the need for more consistent deterrents that reflect the seriousness with which society views the more serious breaches of traffic law, it is timely that the system for consequential disqualifications should be reviewed at this stage. Section 6, therefore, provides that the minimum period of disqualification for the most serious offences, which include dangerous driving causing death or serious injury, and the most serious drink driving offences, will be increased from two years to four years in respect of a first offence and from four to six years for a second or subsequent offence.The new offence of striking a railway or other bridge, which gives rise to death or serious injury, has been added to the list of the offences to which that range of minimum disqualification will apply. The minimum period of disqualification following a conviction for a drink driving offence will now be one year. That same period of disqualification will also be applied to the general range of offences that attract consequential disqualifications. The offence of driving when disqualified has been added to that group of offences and in a final change to this system, the offence of dangerous driving, where it is tried summarily, will also attract a disqualification of at least one year.The review of the system of consequential disqualifications has also prompted an examination of the system whereby persons who have been disqualified from driving may apply to the courts to have their licences returned. The current provisions relating to such applications are cumbersome and lack clarity. In addition, while the principle that underpins this system has merit, its application to all disqualifications raises questions in respect of the degree to which the deterrent value of disqualifications is being compromised. With that in mind, section 7 promotes a new system through which applications may be made to the courts for the restoration of a licence. In particular, the facility will only be applied in respect of first time disqualifications of not less than two years. The determination of "first time" is applied in the context of a ten-year threshold from a previous disqualification. In future, the application for the restoration of a licence may only be made following the completion of half of the period of the disqualification and a successful application will only result in a reduction of one third in the overall period at the maximum. These new provisions will mean that where a person is disqualified for any period of not more than two years, the full period of disqualification will apply and where a person is the subject of repeat disqualifications, he or she will not be able to avail of the facility to apply for the restoration of the licence.Deputy Olivia Mitchell's Bill to ban hand-held mobile phone use while driving provided the House with the opportunity recently to debate the issue of mobile phone and other communication equipment use while driving. It was clear from that debate that all sides in the House wish to see an immediate ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving and for it to be backed up with strong deterrent measures. In that debate many Members also referred to the increasing amount of information, communication and entertainment equipment which has become part and parcel of today's motor vehicle and pointed out the driver distraction risks associated with them when not used responsibly.Section 3 provides specific responses to the principal concerns of the House both in regard to mobile phones and in-vehicle equipment. The section applies a specific ban on the holding of a mobile phone by a person while driving a motor vehicle. It also provides that the Minister may regulate for mobile phone use generally as well as in-vehicle technologies of an information, communication or entertainment nature for the purposes of preventing driver distraction arising from inappropriate use of such technologies by occupants of vehicles.Given the pace and scale of innovation in these sectors, it is considered sensible and necessary to confer such enabling powers on the Minister to control inappropriate and irresponsible uses of these technologies. In addition to a maximum fine of €2,000, the commission of the offence of holding a mobile phone while driving will attract the endorsement of four penalty points on conviction. Following the completion of the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas, I intend to make regulations that will apply a fixed charge in respect of this offence, on the payment of which two penalty points will be applied.I will now turn to the driver licensing provisions of the Bill. Sections 8 to 13 relate to the driver licensing system. The main object of these provisions is the introduction of a learner permit to replace the provisional licence and enabling provisions that will enable me to require learner drivers to undergo a course of instruction. In addition, I will also be able to specify a period which must elapse before a person who obtains a learner permit will be allowed to apply for a driving test. The intention is to ensure that a person will have an opportunity to improve their driving skills before taking the test. I see this provision having a positive effect on the test pass-fail rate.Section 8 provides that the Minister may by order recognise a driving licence issued by another country for the purpose of exchanging that licence for an Irish driving licence. Driving licence exchange arrangements operate in respect of licences issued by member states of the European Union and the EEA. These arrangements are based on provisions in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999.Licence exchange arrangements also operate in respect of licences issued by a limited number of states outside the EU under these regulations. However, we are advised that the power in the regulations to declare such countries as recognised states may be ultra vires and requires primary legislative provision, hence the provision in section 8.Section 9 provides that where a person undergoing a driving test has already passed a theory test, the statutory requirement for driver testers to satisfy themselves that the person has a satisfactory knowledge of the Rules of the Road no longer applies. This should create additional time for testers to undergo the test and will enable further improvements to the delivery of the test without reducing the number of tests that can be delivered per day.Section 10 re-enacts existing provisions in section 42 of the 1961 Road Traffic Act which provides for making regulations governing the driver licensing system. The revised section together with section 11 provides for the introduction of a learner permit to replace the provisional licence. In addition it provides that regulations may require learner drivers to undergo a course of instruction and regulate the content of such courses. This provision will facilitate the introduction of compulsory initial practical training of motorcyclists before they are allowed on the public road.These provisions will facilitate the introduction of reforms to the licensing system to reduce long-term reliance on provisional licences as provided for in the Government's road safety strategy. These reforms are dependent on the current driver testing backlog being eliminated. In this context I appreciate that the driver testers have accepted the proposals to deal with the backlog which were put forward by Mr. Kieran Mulvey CEO of the Labour Relations Commission recently. We are now in the process of putting in place the contract to outsource a limited number of tests and I look forward to a significant reduction in the backlog by early next year.The Bill also changes the penalties that apply for driving without a licence. The provision in section 12 is balanced in that it takes account of situations where a person may have simply failed to renew his or her licence on time. Where a person allows a driving licence to lapse for less than a period of 12 months, he or she will only be liable to a fine not exceeding €1,000 while if the licence has expired for a period of more than 12 months he or she will be liable to a more severe penalty of a fine not exceeding €2,000 and one penalty point on payment of a fixed charge or three penalty points on conviction. In addition a person who is caught driving while disqualified or who does not have a licence will be subject to a mandatory disqualification for a year, as provided for in section 6, and a fine of up to €5,000 or up to six months in prison, or both. I am sure Deputies will agree that these provisions will enable significant reforms to the driving licence regime to be introduced.The Road Safety Strategy 2004-06 promoted the introduction of a legislative basis for a form of random roadside breath testing and for an offence relating to the use of mobile phones by drivers. In addition, the strategy recommended that private sector interests should be engaged in the provision and operation of equipment used for the detection of speeding offences.Speeding continues to be a major contributory factor in causing death and injuries on our roads. The best way to ensure greater levels of compliance with speed limits is a wider deployment of cameras operated by the private sector. The purpose of deploying cameras is to encourage road users to drive within the speed limit, specifically at locations where there is a known speed-related danger of crashes. I assure the House that the central focus of this initiative is on saving lives not on earning revenue. There will be no direct link to the fee paid to the private operator and the number of detections.It has been accepted that the Garda cannot operate a system of fixed and mobile cameras without a significant private sector engagement. Decisions on the locations where cameras will be provided will reflect both experience of speed related collisions and evidence of a history of speeding. A combination of fixed and mobile cameras will operate in target areas. A target of 11.1 million vehicles to be checked for speeding annually as outlined in the Road Safety Strategy cannot be achieved without privatisation.Section 17 delivers on this commitment. The section addresses the specific parameters necessary to facilitate the engagement of a private sector operator. However, I remind the House that the Government is fully committed to the establishment of very strict criteria that will be applied in respect of the determination of the locations and operational parameters for the engagement of the private sector in this area and this project will be under the control of the Garda at both the strategic and operational levels.The use of safety cameras is just one of a range of measures that have been implemented or are currently being implemented. Significant changes were introduced in 2004 with a review of speed limits leading to a lowering of speed limits on regional roads, the metrication of speed limits, better and more signage and a safety awareness campaign on speed limits to improve road safety.There have been press reports within the past week as regards speeding cases being dismissed in Bray District Court over a query regarding the legality of the special speed limit of 60 kph that Wicklow County Council have applied on the N11 at Kilmacanogue, in lieu of the default speed limit of 100 kph. Wicklow County Council has indicated that it is satisfied that the special speed limit in question is validly applied. Press reports on this issue over the weekend erroneously linked the circumstances relating to the application of the special speed limit at Kilmacanogue with the changeover to metric speed limits in January 2005, stating that special speed limits across the country are in question on account of the fact that local councils did not pass resolutions to ratify special speed limits following the changeover to metric speed limits. This is inaccurate and I want to take the opportunity to put clarification of the matter on the public record.The Road Traffic Act 2004 that was passed through the Houses here in late 2004 contained express transitional provisions in section 12 that provided for the automatic conversion of speed limits in existing special speed limit by-laws that were expressed in miles per hour values to read as specified metric values. This conversion through operation of the statute came into operation on 20 January 2005 on the commencement of section 12. No requirement arose therefore on local authorities to go through a ratification or any other process, as suggested in the media reports, in relation to the conversion of speed limit values that stood in special speed limit by-laws on 20 January 2006.In view of the importance of road safety generally and the need to provide the maximum level of deterrent possible, it is appropriate to look again at the general level of financial penalties that may be applied to traffic offences. The level of maximum financial penalties was last reviewed through the Road Traffic Act 2002. However, significant increases in the levels of fines have since been, promulgated in other legislation. Section 18 sets out the result of that review, and provides in particular that the lowest level of maximum fine applicable to a road traffic offence will now be €1,000. This is an increase of 25% over the comparable level set in 2002.In referring to the issue in Wicklow as regards confusion over the metric value, I should have stressed it is the responsibility of local authorities to ensure all existing by-laws that stemmed from the conversion were properly ratified by them over the years, or whatever levels they have set in terms of introducing the special speed limit by-laws, to ensure this has been done correctly, in accordance with the by-laws. It was simply not correct to say that it was because of the changeover. We introduced legislation and automatic reflection on that stands. However, there is also an onus on local authorities to ensue that the original ratification of these by-laws was done correctly in the first place.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	245	That is correct — if there were new ones, subsequently, that were not included in a local authority's by-laws to start with.The Bill, in addition to addressing the major policy issues I have outlined, provides for a number of necessary initiatives that will help to bring clarity to a number of areas, with particular attention being paid to deterrents.Section 2 will allow for the use of regulations under the Road Traffic Acts to be used for the purpose of transposing EU legislative initiatives into Irish law. This provision is necessary following the determination by the Supreme Court in the Browne and Kennedy judgment.Sections 14 and 15 provide for the introduction of a number of changes to the fixed charge system, which include the capacity of applying the system to the offences that have been recently created under the European Communities regulations relating to the use of seat belts and child restraint systems and which replaced similar regulations made under the Road Traffic Acts. Other new fixed charge offences being introduced in section 14 relate to road transport operator licensing rules. This provision means that freight and passenger transport operators can, under regulations to be made by the Minister for Transport, face fixed charges for operating illegally and, very importantly, for breaking tachograph and excessive driving hours rules. There are obvious safety benefits that should flow from that. This provision also allows the Department's transport officers, who will move to the Road Safety Authority when it is formally established, to issue fixed charge notices for these types of offences, thus extending even further the number and range of officers enforcing road safety laws.Section 16 introduces changes to the penalty points system that are also targeted at the application of that system to the new seat belt and child restraint offences and sees the application of the system to offences relating to the use of mobile phones and offences relating to bridge strikes, as I have already indicated. Section 19 provides for the extension of the powers available to the Garda to detain uninsured vehicles to vehicles that are registered in states other than Ireland. This is an issue that many colleagues have previously raised in the House.Section 20 provides for the restatement of section 115 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, to provide that the offence relating to the making of false declarations will be extended to reflect the various changes made to road traffic laws over the past 45 years regarding licences, permits and certificates. Section 21 makes minor changes to the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 to facilitate the development of a superannuation scheme by the Commission for Taxi Regulation and to clarity certain provisions in section 36 of that Act, which refers to mandatory disqualification from holding or applying for a licence by a person who has committed one of a range of serious offences.The key determinant of road safety performance is the behaviour of road users. The primary focus of our road safety strategy is to influence positively the behaviour of road users. This can be attained through initiatives across a range of areas, including the enactment and enforcement of laws that promote road user behaviour. Such laws must also be underpinned and supported by the application of fines, prison sentences and driving disqualifications. This Bill is one element of the programme for the advancement of road safety that will deliver the gains that society requires, whether in the short, medium or long term. Over the past two years major institutional changes have taken place that will support that requirement. The establishment of the dedicated Garda traffic corps and the allocation to that force of an additional 60 officers per quarter represents a very significant level of delivery on the Government's commitment to meet the immediate challenges presented by those who continue to commit traffic offences.The recent passage of legislation to provide for the establishment of the Road Safety Authority is testament to the need for a radical approach to the development of future road safety policy. That approach is also supported by the separate establishment of a special ministerial committee on road safety, chaired by me, to promote cross-cutting road safety issues and at which all of the relevant Ministers are afforded the opportunity to address issues of immediate importance in a collective and systematic way.The Bill presented to the House today is targeted at very specific areas in respect of which there is a particular urgency. When taken with the institutional changes mentioned above, the Bill marks a significant watershed in the deployment of road safety policy. Deputies will appreciate that there is a particular urgency which the Government wishes to see applied to the passage of the Bill. In particular, we wish to allow for the early deployment of mandatory alcohol testing and to begin the process for the engagement of private interests in the operation of the speed camera programme. I am sure Deputies will make very worthwhile suggestions for initiatives in the area of road safety that do not fall within the parameters I have set for this Bill. Any such suggestions will be considered very carefully and it is my intention to return to the House with a further road traffic Bill before the end of the year. I look forward to the co-operation of members in facilitating passage of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.

However, I regret that the Bill, as constituted, does not derive from any over-arching and coherent policy on our road safety problems. It is, in effect, a miscellaneous provisions Bill rather than a road traffic Bill. It deals with the issues in a piecemeal fashion. It is a collection of unrelated issues simply pulled together into single but disconnected legislation. Having said that, Fine Gael accepts and supports the general principles of the Bill.The issues dealt with in the Bill would never have seen the light of day had it not been for the Opposition's persistent criticism and outrage at scandals such as driving without a licence and without passing a test, which was allowed to persist for 400,000 drivers. The Minister spoke about his efforts to tackle the driver testing backlog, but the truth is that the Government was quite happy to sit on its hands for eight years before any attempt was made to address the problem. The problem has grown over these eight years and it is not at all clear that this Bill will make any great difference. Simply changing the name from a "licence" to a "permit" does not make acceptable the failure to ensure the right to drive freely on our roads is contingent on passing a test. Giving the Minister additional powers to provide for graduated licences or permits is a pointless exercise and cannot be implemented until the testing system works and drivers can be tested virtually on request.The Minister has been announcing and reannouncing measures for this Bill on an almost daily basis, for which it seems he must have a press conference. Passing legislation which provides for further restrictions on learner drivers gives the impression of progress. However, we cannot even implement the single restriction we already have for learner drivers, that is, the requirement to have an accompanying fully licensed driver. While we have put up with that situation in Ireland and have an almost limitless capacity to tolerate the intolerable, our neighbours in Europe, rightly, are not willing to tolerate that. Now that they have discovered with disbelief that we have been blithely allowing untested drivers and failed drivers to drive freely, not just on our roads, but on their roads as well, they are rightly about to throw the book at us.Nothing in this Bill will change that scandal and the timid measures recently announced by the Minister will not have an impact for years. I refer to the measures for the outsourcing of 40,000 tests, which I believe is insufficient. I do not believe it will have the expected impact. The Minister has blamed everybody for the delay, including the unions, Sustaining Progress and the drivers who fail to turn up for their tests. It is always the fault of someone else, but the truth is that the fault is with the Government. This is the result of monumental incompetence and indifference over many years. The gross incompetence demonstrated in respect of the driver testing system reflects the general attitude to road safety by the Government. In turn, this is reflected in the attitude of many road users to drink driving and speeding. These attitudes are directly responsible for the growing and unacceptably high numbers killed and seriously injured on our roads.Most measures in the Bill, such as the graduated licence, depend on enforcement of the existing legislation. We have not managed to do that. It seems a pointless exercise to introduce graduated licences because one must take a test to graduate to the next level. Until the testing system is sorted, there is no point in bringing in further restrictions. Our legislation and how we implement it shapes public attitudes and informs public behaviour. There is a huge responsibility on all of us to take very seriously road safety legislation and implementation.The Bill provides for a long overdue ban on mobile phones. Successive Ministers assured us that this could not be done because a definition of a mobile phone could not be found. It was only when Fine Gael introduced a Bill to ban mobile phones that the Minister was able to do so. However, I am not sure he was quite as able, because any lawyer to whom I showed this section has said that it is utterly deficient. I ask the Minister to consider amendments before Committee Stage. For instance, there is no definition of "driving" yet the operation of the entire section rests entirely on that word. The Bill states: "A person shall not, while driving a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place, hold a mobile phone." The Minister and I both know the everyday meaning of the word, but it may have a very different interpretation in a technical, legal sense. Does being stopped in traffic constitute driving? Does being belted up with the engine on, ready to go but not actually moving constitute driving? If we do not define "driving", the courts will do it for us.This provision will be widely enforced by the Garda because it is widespread practice and we can see it at any time of the day. Conviction can result in penalty points or a fine of up to €2,000. In some cases, the penalty points may push the driver over the 12-point limit, resulting in the loss of a licence. Therefore, this provision will be the subject of intense scrutiny by lawyers. Everyone to whom I have spoken has indicated that it is wide open to legal challenge. We cannot prevent the challenges, but we can anticipate them and the very least we can do is ensure there is no ambiguity in the Bill. One way of avoiding ambiguity is to include a strong definitions provision in legislation. It is our job to say what we mean in the legislation we pass, otherwise the courts will say it for us.As the Minister is aware, the provision regarding the use of a mobile phone will be primarily applied in the District Court where judges are well known for their lack of consistency in approach. The decisions and direction of decisions depend on individual judges' likes and dislikes, preferences and prejudices. If we are serious about what we do in this House, we must take this fact into account. It should reinforce our determination to limit the opportunity for judicial imagination in interpreting what we say in regard to this legislation. It is not only that this section is ambiguous, it is also weak in limiting what is prohibited merely to holding a mobile phone. It should also be given the belt and braces provision of prohibiting the holding and-or using of a hand-held mobile phone.The defence provided for in section 3(7) to allow a call to be made to a member of the Garda Síochána is wide open to abuse. This defence provision would open the flood gates to applications for penalty points to be removed. I can understand a person using a mobile phone to make such a call in a genuine emergency, but the section does not state that. The section is open to people claiming they were making a call to the Garda because in respect of pay as you go mobile phones, there is not a record of calls made. A motorist caught by a garda making a call on a mobile phone could say he or she was ringing the Garda and in the case of a call of short duration — the destination will not necessarily be recorded on the bill. Inevitably some motorists caught in such circumstances will claim they were using a mobile phone to telephone the Garda, even when they were not. Even if they were, such a call is permitted under the legislation even when the call is not in respect of urgent matter. One could telephone the Garda about one's driving licence or about a signature on a passport application form. A mobile phone should be only used by a motorist to make a call in a genuine emergency and the circumstances must be demonstrated to be an emergency. While a mobile phone can be used by a motorist to make an emergency call, the section must be amended to ensure claims of casual calls to the Garda cannot be used as a defence.Another significant provision allows for mandatory alcohol testing. This is a measure we were assured could not be included in the legislation. The Minister informed us that he had consulted the Attorney General and received independent legal advice on this matter. However, it was only after a period of sustained political pressure that suddenly not only was this measure possible, but the Minister was claiming credit for its inclusion. The reality is that he was dragged kicking and screaming to this Pauline conversion.In terms of the way the legislation is framed, there is no doubt that giving power to the Garda to test for alcohol without suspicion or cause is considerable and represents an encroachment on a constitutionally guaranteed liberty. The giving of such power has been a problem in regard to such legislation and a reason such a measure has not been introduced prior to now. I believe that society will accept this encroachment. We may not like it but given the widely accepted consequences of drink driving for potentially every member of society, it will be viewed by society as a justified limit on our liberty. Some protection for the public in this context is required and some constraints on the exercise of Garda power are required if this legislation is to withstand challenges in the courts.The requirement for authorisation by an inspector to be in place prior to a road-block is reasonable and a necessary protection for the public, but the legislation, as it is worded, does not limit an authorisation to a specified day or week. Every one in the legal profession to whom I have shown this legislation indicates it is far too lax, open-ended and open to challenge. It offers no protection to the public in the way in which we envisage it will be necessary and the courts will find necessary if it is to withstand constitutional challenge. In practice, under this legislation an inspector could sign an authorisation in January which might be valid for the entire year. It is a protection intended to protect the public and the provision is to ensure that a measure would be acceptable in the courts should it be challenged and, as the Minister is aware, undoubtedly it will be challenged.The legislation should also provide for authorisation by the Garda of other persons to escort people who have failed a roadside breath test to a station or perhaps to a van where they could be given an intoxiliser, blood or urine test. Such a provision is not included in the Bill. Given the strict time limit allowed between the beathalyser test and the intoxiliser evidential test, the numbers potentially to be caught at a busy checkpoint could result in a major waste of gardaí time while they ferry motorists to a station to be tested. I accept the test must be done by an expert who is trained to carry out such testing, but such a provision could ensure that gardaí could remain on duty at a roadblock while an authorised person could bring an offender to the station or elsewhere to have the test carried out.Section 4 also allows a garda to arrest without warrant a person "who in the member's opinion" is committing an offence under this section. I have spoken to many lawyers and many members of the public about this provision, but nobody has the slightest idea why it is included or what it means. Perhaps the Minister could clarify it. We already know there is a difficulty in establishing in court the basis for forming an opinion — that has always been problematic for the Garda. As the section is worded, it appears it would allow a garda to form an opinion independent of any testing. If that is the case, what is the point of having a roadblock and a test in the first place? Doubts about the intention underpinning this provision will result inevitably in court challenges. It may be that the Minister or somebody else is perfectly clear about why this provision is included, but it is not clear to anybody else. If it is not clear to me or to legal experts, it certainly will not be clear to the courts and it will leave judges free to interpret what it means. The provision must be clarified by amendment on Committee Stage to ensure the intention of the Minister and the Oireachtas is made clear to judges and that it is clearly stated in the Act and not merely in the House as part of a parliamentary debate on Second or Committee Stages. It must be amended and I ask the Minister to take that on board.Sections 5 and 17 relate to outsourcing and in the case of section 5 to the issuing of disqualification notices as a result of drink driving offences, accepting fine payment and issuing receipts. I understood that practice was already under way and therefore I am a little perplexed as to why we are now legislating for it.The main issue I wish to raise is in section 17, which empowers the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outsource the operation of speed cameras subject only to selection by the Garda of the camera locations. I welcome what the Minister said about the complete disconnection intended between the number of speeding offences detected and remuneration to the speed camera company. I favour the introduction of speed cameras and I would like them to be introduced on a widespread basis. The speed camera system can be utterly fair if it is properly implemented and, more importantly, it can release gardaí for real policing duties.I raised the issue of the danger of using the speed camera system for revenue raising purposes. It is important that members of the public see that the system is not used for that purpose because if they are to accept the speed camera system they must be assured it is entirely objective. I do not believe anybody could accuse me of being against outsourcing but this is an issue of the administration of justice and it is different from other kinds of outsourcing. For that reason not only should the location of the cameras be subject to Garda control and supervision but the overall speed camera system should be subject to supervision by the Garda. I fully support getting the day to day work off the shoulders of gardaí, but such a system must have the overall safeguard of Garda supervision if the public is to have confidence in it. More important from an evidential perspective, the backing of Garda authority is essential from the point of view of withstanding court challenges, which will occur, to the outsourcing of the speed camera system. I urge the Minister to ensure the legislation is amended accordingly to put the overall system under Garda supervision.I wish to refer to the penalty points system because this legislation extends penalty points to a further number of offences and increases fines and penalties. I have raised with the Minister and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on a number of occasions the issue of how the penalty points system is implemented. I am concerned specifically about the removal of penalty points from people's driver licence files. I welcome the clarification the Minister has given today about the court case in Wicklow, which I always understood was quite different from the problem that seems to be associated with special speed limits. There have been questions in that regard. I welcome the Minister's clarification that this is watertight in legislation.Nevertheless, in reply to a parliamentary question, I was informed that, since the new protocol was introduced, there have already been 823 cases of penalty points being removed from people's licences. This protocol was not introduced until I raised the problem in the House and it began to arise in the courts. Almost all the 823 cases had to do with the absence of by-laws, which implies there is a major problem and a need for local authorities to get their by-laws in order. This problem may be a slightly different problem from that referred to in newspapers, but it is urgent if all the points relate to that matter.The minimum requirement of our justice system is for it to be just. With the protocol in place, we now have a mechanism for removing incorrectly recorded penalty points from a person's licence file, but it only applies to penalty points received as a result of paying a fine. Penalty points received as a result of a court case are doubled as a result of the case going to court. We must have an automatic system in place to remove these points from people's files when they are found to be incorrectly recorded, which happens often, as evidenced by the batch that arose in court last week.It is unacceptable and unconscionable that people who were incorrectly accused, through no fault of their own but as a result of a defect in the system or a mistake by the authorities, should be forced to the inconvenience, cost and stress of returning to court when they are clearly not to blame. I urge the Minister to set the automatic system in place as part of the legislation. If the penalty points system is to work and gain widespread public acceptance, the least the public is entitled to expect is that the implementation of the scheme should be impeccable and fair.The legislation does not deal with the issue of expired driving licences or the offence of driving without a licence, but this type of legislation should change the current system. Many people get ten-year driving licences although they could get licences for a shorter period. We have, apparently, invested a fortune in getting the national driver file up to scratch to be capable of operating the penalty points system. I hope this is true and that it can do what is expected of it. Now that the system is fully computerised, it is only reasonable to expect that people will be notified when their driving licence is about to go out of date. This is not too onerous a demand. We are notified when our road tax is out of date, so we should be notified about our driving licences. This is the least people can expect if they will have to go through the process of retaking a test if their licences lapse. I hope the Minister takes this on board.I could have raised many of the headline-grabbing issues omitted from the legislation, but I have tried to concentrate on what is in it instead. Much of the Bill, especially that dealing with permits and driving licences, is enabling legislation and we do not know when it can come into force. Whether it will be of value and give results depends on two things, namely, the resources provided for the implementation of the measures proposed and the robustness of the legislation. Much of our current legislation does not work because resources were not invested in it. I accept there is an urgency to the legislation, but in recent weeks we have seen several cases in the courts which show the impact of court challenges to our road safety regime. We cannot prevent challenges, but we can do all in our power to ensure our legislation is as robust and resistant to challenge as possible.The new chairman of the Road Safety Authority expressed the hope that the Opposition would not delay the legislation. We found that hard to take because we were not aware the Opposition was to blame. If it had not been for the Opposition's persistence, there would have been no legislation. We certainly cannot be blamed for the delay and, without our persistence, Mr. Gay Byrne would not have been chairman, nor would there have been a Road Safety Authority. It is a little difficult for us to be taken to task for delaying the legislation and for us to be referred to as "that other crowd".Notwithstanding this, it is vital for us to scrutinise this type of legislation thoroughly. It is important that the chairman of the Road Safety Authority and others understand the role of both Parliament and Opposition in a democracy. Nobody will be slow to criticise us if the legislation falls at the first fence, and we all accept it will have many fences to face. Road traffic legislation is the most challenged of all, and we should bear in mind that no legislation might be better than bad legislation.We know from events in the courts in recent weeks that the potential for harm and for sending the wrong message is enormous where legislation is found to be deficient. It need not even be found deficient, just sufficiently doubtful not to be taken seriously by the courts and for them to accept that a reasonable case to challenge it exists.I understand and share Mr. Byrne's impatience to see additional measures enacted to enforce road safety. I want the Minister to know that I and my colleagues intend to do our job on this legislation. I have taken time to outline some of the amendments necessary if we are to produce a robust Road Traffic Act that will make our roads safer for all who use them. I urge the Minister to listen to my concerns and do his part to bring forward the necessary amendments to ensure the Act we pass is robust. Perhaps he could take Opposition amendments on board. He must be open to the fact that we understand the urgency and need to have the legislation on the Statute Book before the end of the session. Nevertheless, if he wants our co-operation, he should listen to our concerns about it.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	247	The Labour Party generally welcomes the measures outlined in the Bill, which is long overdue. I agree with the points made by Deputy Olivia Mitchell that it has come about as a result of persistence within this House, the public outcry over what is happening on our roads and the urgent need to introduce modern legislation to address the problems that exist. While we know that speeding is a serious problem, the issue is with detection. How can we enforce the existing law and how can we detect people who continue to take risks with speeding? We have been promised privately-operated speed cameras for many years and I welcome the fact that the Bill will provide for these. However, we are a long way from having those much-needed cameras on the side of the road. It is very hard to understand the delays in this regard.We are dealing with this legislation in the context of a fairly poor record on road safety. We had the initial 1998 road safety strategy and then the 2004-06 strategy. When these strategies were launched, we were told that they would tackle the problem by creating awareness about the need to drive carefully and observe the speed limits, not to drink and drive and various other matters. In spite of all the hype, publicity and glossy publications, those strategies have failed. The current road safety strategy set a target of a maximum of 300 deaths on our roads this year. Some 159 deaths have taken place since January and it is highly unlikely that we will reach the target. Probably a more telling target is the three-year target up to the end of 2006 set in the road safety strategy. However, by mid-April we had already exceeded that target with eight months still to run.We are debating the Bill in a context where the numbers of deaths and serious injuries on our roads are increasing. There is general recognition that something needs to be done urgently. It is not just about launching strategies with glossy publications and issuing the umpteen press statements that have been released on this legislation. It is about tackling the issue in a serious minded way, looking at the detail of what needs to be done to change the culture in respect of driving in this country. We all accept we have a problem regarding our culture. Not only must Government play its part in changing that culture, but it must also guarantee having a robust body of law to deal with the problem and most importantly we need a guarantee that the laws on the Statute Book will be enforced. This has been the main problem with road safety over the years. We have had plenty of law, but it was not enforced. All kinds of excuses were made. I am very sceptical about the rush to introduce new legislation when existing legislation is not being adequately enforced. This is the context in which we are debating the legislation. The single most important issue in respect of road safety is having adequate enforcement of the law.The Bill highlights the need to consolidate all road traffic legislation. The Bill is very difficult to read as it contains so many references to other legislation. We know that various speeding, drink-driving and other cases have resulted in challenges to legislation. Having unconsolidated legislation with references to umpteen different Acts lends itself to being contested in court. It creates the industry of solicitors and barristers who make a very good living out of challenging road traffic legislation and exploiting potential weaknesses and inaccuracies. The Minister referred to the need to carry out such consolidation in the past. I wonder why he did not avail of the opportunity afforded by this legislation. It is not as if we suddenly realised the need for legislation. Having the legislation spread over many different Acts is unacceptable and chaotic. This Bill amends 15 other Acts. It is no wonder so many offences are challenged in the courts.While there are many facets to the road safety problem, the key ones relate to drink-driving, speeding and general driver behaviour. Deputy Olivia Mitchell and I, with other Opposition Members, identified two particular areas more than a year ago. We raised the issues here on umpteen occasions and discussed them in detail with the Minister at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport. We met the Minister privately to discuss breath testing. We went through the issues in detail. Throughout last year the Minister maintained that random breath testing posed serious legal and constitutional difficulties. It is extraordinary that having kept this up throughout last year, this year after a particularly bad weekend on the roads leading to a public outcry, with many people talking about the need to tackle the problems of speed and drink-driving, the Minister announced that there was no problem after all and that he would proceed to legislate as he has done in this Bill. Why has it taken so long? If all those problems existed last year, what happened to allow them to just vanish? At no point did the Minister provide a satisfactory explanation given the delays we all endured last year. Suddenly, as if by magic, the problem is now resolved. We are due an explanation.Obviously random breath testing is one of the most important aspects of the Bill and one of the most important factors in respect of our very poor performance in road safety. The Minister made the same excuses in respect of mobile phones. The use of mobile phones while driving was to have been outlawed and the offence was to attract penalty points in the first raft of penalty point offences going back to 1998. It is only now in 2006 that the Minister is moving to deal with the issue. Throughout that period he referred to legal difficulties. Can he assure us that those difficulties have been overcome? What, exactly, were those difficulties?Licensing for learner drivers is also critical and the Bill is very disappointing in this regard. The Minister has missed an opportunity to make considerable progress in addressing the unregulated and unacceptable arrangements in place for learner drivers. He maintains he will end unaccompanied arrangements for this group but has provided no detail on a timeframe for doing so. I have outlined the critical areas which I propose to address in detail.As I stated, the Labour Party supports this Bill and intends to facilitate its passage, irrespective of how late the House must sit in the weeks before the summer recess. This legislation must be passed and signed into law before the recess because the summer months tend to be a bad time on the roads. We need to do all in our power to try to improve matters.I was incredulous when I heard the new chairman of the Road Safety Authority state the Bill needed to be enacted as quickly as possible and could be passed before the summer provided the Opposition parties did not choose to play games on the issue. For how long have we waited for this legislation? For years, Opposition Members have called for its introduction every time the Minister has taken questions in the House or appeared before the Joint Committee on Transport. Now, three weeks before the summer recess when Deputies finally have an opportunity to debate the legislation, the chairman of the Road Safety Authority makes the unfortunate comment that all will be fine provided no one holds it up.

I will take my time and argue my points as we proceed through Committee and Report Stages. I hope we will have a stronger Bill when we complete our considerations. This is how parliamentary democracy works. No single person has a monopoly on wisdom in this area.On the specifics of the Bill, section 3, which deals with mobile telephones, proposes to impose a ban on holding a mobile telephone while driving. I will repeat a point made earlier in this regard. The Bill does not appear to define the word "driving". I have not found such a definition in section 3 or elsewhere. Given the likelihood that this section will be contested, it is important to provide a clear definition.The Bill proposes that the offence of driving while holding a mobile telephone will be established on the basis of the opinion of a garda. Many of the new penalty points offences are also established on the basis of the opinion or word of a garda. I foresee these types of provision being the subject of many challenges in the courts. How, for instance, will a garda establish that the item in the hand of a driver was a mobile telephone? Could the driver have been holding something else? I am concerned about the responsibility the provision to allow the opinion of a garda to be taken as evidence places on gardaí and expect it to be challenged in the courts.I accept that difficulties have arisen with regard to definitions, for example, as to what precisely constitutes a mobile telephone. Many people use headsets which allow users to hold the telephone device in the ear. The definition "holding" in the Bill is to hold a telephone by hand or support it with "another part of the body". Given that one supports these types of headsets with one's ear, I presume they will also be outlawed. I cannot discern much difference between a headset and a hands-free mobile telephone placed in a cradle on the dashboard. Does the Minister intend to ban the use of these types of headsets while driving?

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	257	To return to the proposal that an offence is deemed to have been committed if a garda witnesses a mobile telephone being used by a person driving, the number of cars with tinted windows will increase once this legislation is enacted. How can a garda see if a driver of a car which has tinted windows is speaking on a mobile telephone? This is an important point which occurred to me before the legislation was published. I am concerned about the use of tinted windows on cars and uncertain as to the justification for them. Anyone in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle should be visible. Perhaps the Minister will address the use of tinted windows because they will make this legislation unenforceable and present a general problem. For example, in terms of enforcing the law on speeding the owner of a car with tinted windows photographed while exceeding the speed limit could argue that he or she was not driving and is not aware of who was driving at the time the photograph was taken. I will propose an amendment to address the matter.The definitions set out in section 3(9) will become obsolete as mobile telephone technology develops. For this reason, the Minister should include an arrangement to allow the section to be regularly updated by ministerial order. Given that technology is moving at such a fast rate, we should ensure the introduction of every new version of a mobile communications device does not necessitate a change in the law. It should be possible for the Minister to amend the legislation by regulation.Section 4 deals with mandatory alcohol testing. Why is it necessary to require a senior garda to authorise a road check? This requirement places a significant burden on Garda inspectors. Perhaps it helps to bypass potential constitutional impediments. Why was it necessary?Section 5, which deals with drink driving, gives rise to many concerns. I have already indicated that the practice of having two, three or more drinks before taking a chance and driving home is very much part of our culture. We must all recognise and endeavour to eliminate this problem. Deputies present will recall a time when people would think nothing of drinking for three or four hours before driving home. The only reason many of us survived that period is that there were fewer cars on the road and they could not travel at great speed. Most Members of a certain generation grew up during an era when people held very different attitudes towards drink driving. Thankfully, such attitudes are no longer acceptable to younger people, many of whom never drink when driving. However, major cultural problems remain among middle aged and older people in respect of drink driving, and a small number of young people cannot see danger because they think they will live forever.The Minister should have availed of the opportunity presented by this Bill to lower blood alcohol limits. Only Ireland, the UK and one other country have established blood alcohol limits of 80 milligrams. Other European countries have limits of 50 milligrams. We should send out a loud and clear message on this issue and I hope the Minister will consider an amendment to reduce the limit to 50 milligrams.In a recent press announcement, the Minister said he was considering a reduction in the blood alcohol limit to as near to zero as possible for learner drivers, a limit which has been introduced in other jurisdictions. However, he did not provide for this in the Bill.

I am not satisfied that the Garda's record-keeping capabilities are adequate to deal with a situation in which somebody is convicted of an offence or pays a fixed penalty and is disqualified for six months. For example, it can be up to six months before a person receives notice of a fixed penalty for speeding. If people are now to be disqualified for a further six months, what happens if they are caught a second time during the six months in which the first notice is being processed? I would not share the Minister's confidence in the records and data available to the Garda.It appears that fixed penalties will not be recorded as convictions. Why should records not be kept of what, in essence, are convictions? The driver concerned has admitted he or she was over the limit and received a fine and disqualification.No mention is made of the penalty which could have been introduced to demote a driver from a full to a provisional licence upon a drink driving conviction, even though the Minister referred to such a provision. It would be an effective way of changing the culture of drink driving.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	262	There must be an expectation that the test can be retaken within a reasonable timeframe. We cannot fulfil such an expectation until we resolve the test backlog.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	263	That backlog could last forever. Section 6 revises upwards the penalties applying to drink driving offences. The period of time in which a licence is suspended upon conviction for drink driving has been extended to a minimum of one year in all cases, depending on the concentration of alcohol found in a person's blood. The provisions in the principal Act allow judges to hand down lower sentences in special circumstances. I am not sure about the wisdom of that. The maximum penalty is four years for a first offence and six years for a second. Why have sentences been capped at six years? No distinction appears to have been made between licence categories. For example, heavy goods vehicle and bus drivers, who could do enormous damage, are being treated the same as car drivers. The penalties imposed on the former should be much more severe.Section 7 allows a driver to apply for a reduction in his or her period of disqualification. I have concerns about this provision and will table amendments to it. However, I welcome the fact that gardaí will now be able to seize uninsured foreign registered cars.Section 10 does not provide for post-licensing restrictions. The experience of other countries indicates that the critical period in terms of accident risk for drivers is the first four to seven months after passing the test. It is generally agreed that drivers should be restricted during the first 12 months of qualification. I will propose amendments for such restrictions, which are already in place in other European countries. This section does not provide for the demotion of drivers to learner status as a penalty, even though such a penalty could act as a severe deterrent.Section 12 sets out a penalty of €1,000 for driving for up to 12 months without renewing a licence and €2,000 in respect of driving for longer than 12 months. It also sets out penalties for driving while disqualified and provides for another category of person who will be required to produce a certificate of competency or fitness before obtaining a driving licence. However, that provision is somewhat ambiguous. A distinction should be made between drivers of cars and those who drive heavy vehicles.

A separate penalty, perhaps set at €3,000 and a prison sentence, should be introduced where a person deliberately provides a false name to the Garda. A number of provisions could be introduced. I hope the Minister will accept amendments from the Opposition that will improve the legislation and that the Minister will have an open mind on Committee and Report Stages. We are supportive of the legislation but believe enforcement is the key. That includes resources for the Garda Síochána.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I propose to share time with Deputies Catherine Murphy and Boyle. Like the previous speaker I believe the key is enforcement. Any progressive measures to combat the carnage on our roads and prevent unnecessary loss of life by significantly reducing preventable motor accidents will be welcomed by Sinn Féin and all Members. Some 399 people lost their lives on Irish roads in 2005 and 185 have died this year as of 19 June. This is an increase of 11 on last year's figure.This Bill will contribute to road safety but it contains flaws. It is important we pass legislation as quickly as possible but flaws must be highlighted and changes made. The introduction of mandatory alcohol testing seems a positive step. The problem of drink driving is particularly acute and such a measure is expected to deter people from taking risks and detect those that do. This can be equated with random breath testing, an obvious method of increasing detection of those irresponsible drivers who consume alcohol before driving. I have no problem with this concept as long as it is not used to target certain individuals. A superintendent is required to authorise a checkpoint and this provides a balance. Random breath testing was first mooted during the tenure of Deputy Brennan as Minister for Transport. The delay in its introduction has cost lives.The increase in punishment has been due for some time. Drunk drivers can currently face bans of as little as three months if convicted of driving while over the limit. This minimum penalty will be doubled with the passing of this Bill. Disqualification periods and fines will also increase.Section 5 stipulates that a driver caught with a certain alcohol intake over the limit will pay €300 and receive a six month ban. However, drivers who challenge their case in court and are subsequently found guilty will face heftier punishment and a minimum 12 month ban. This policy of deterring people from a court hearing is contentious. Citizens should have a right to access the courts and should not be penalised for opting to exercise this right. All such drivers should be treated equally and guilty drivers, whether they choose to challenge the case in court or not, should be liable to equivalent repercussions for similar offences instead of discriminating against those who challenge the case in court.A review of drink driving laws is needed. Although many campaigners have called for a blanket ban on alcohol before using a vehicle, the same amount of alcohol affects everyone differently. Greater awareness of the effects and dangers of drink driving should be made a priority. We must challenge the mentality that drinking a couple of pints and then driving is acceptable. The Minister referred to young people but people of our generation are the major problem. One sees people driving at closing time but there is a way to respond to this. Instead of public order, we need to invest in high-visibility Garda checkpoints and patrols at closing time.I call on the Ministers for Transport and Education and Science to finalise a plan to introduce road safety as an integral part of the secondary school curriculum. Transition year could be used to educate our future drivers on how to drive responsibly, as is the case in the United States. A talk on road safety delivered by a garda may have minimal effect on students but talks by victims of road accidents may be a positive step in hammering home the message of safe driving. Fines and penalty points alone will not change the minds of the driving public. Road safety is in everyone's interests and education is the key.Another increasing phenomenon endangering lives on the roads is drug driving. The head of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety has warned that the extent of drug driving in Ireland is significantly underestimated. Eye-opening evidence from Scandinavian countries suggests that for every 100 people detected drink driving, 50 more have taken drugs before driving. The scale of drug taking among young people in Ireland is much higher than that of European countries. The explosion of cocaine use in this country, and the inadequate response to drug driving, will lead to an increase in drug taking. In the constituency I represent cocaine is freely available to all age groups. This Bill has no provision for testing for drug taking even though the Minister has acknowledged this is a serious, growing problem. Gardaí need to be trained to recognise behaviour and symptoms suggesting drug driving, as are members of police forces in other countries.The provision for privatisation does not surprise me. The Bill will pave the way for private sector interests operating speed cameras and this is not a positive step. Private operators will be driven by profit rather than enhancing road safety. In private companies shareholders are all that count, to the cost of the greater common good. Drivers will be caught on motorways rather than on rural roads and roads with black spots. The monetary incentive to place cameras on such roads is a problem. Privatisation of a section of the law is not the answer and will not enhance public safety. It will result in indignation and frustration among Irish drivers.Section 11 proposes the replacement of the provisional licence with a learner permit. Reforms to reduce long-term dependency on provisional licences are positive. Stipulating a minimum period during which a learner driver may not apply for a test will give learners time to complete necessary practice. Recently, a radio station invited transport spokespersons to undertake a test and we all failed. It is not just learners who need to learn but those who consider themselves safe drivers. People need to improve their driving skills and this should be examined.The introduction of mandatory lessons will undoubtedly improve the overall driving ability of all concerned. However, it is stated that these regulations may require learner drivers to undergo a course of instruction. Clarity is needed on how many hours of instruction are envisaged and over what period. Driving lessons should be affordable to encourage their uptake, and the introduction of compulsory initial practical training for motorcycles——

I called for mandatory alcohol testing in October and November 2005 and I asked that the collective responsibility of the Government be exercised on the killing fields which are our roads, but this Bill does not go far enough.Other than alcohol, there is no testing for drugs. I spoke about this in the Dáil on a number of occasions and I will do so again. Everyone involved in a road traffic accident needs to be breathalysed. I have sought this in the Dáil and I seek it again, especially for those involved in fatal or serious road traffic accidents. As matters stand, a driver can walk away without being breathalysed. I abhor the terrible consequences of drink driving and know the terrible effects the loss of a loved one through a drunken driver can have on a family. It is scandalous that this Bill does not address this matter and I demand that it be changed to ensure that any driver involved in a serious road traffic accident, especially where someone is killed, is breathalysed for alcohol and tested for drugs.The Bill also does not address the serious failure of any public authority to take responsibility for public safety, including road accidents due to road conditions for which no one is apparently responsible. Neither does the Bill address the gross underestimation in serious and fatal road traffic accidents caused mainly by road conditions. I repeat my previous call for an audit of all road traffic accidents because I believe that the number of accidents attributed solely or mainly to road conditions is grossly underestimated.There should be a consideration for those provisional licence holders in their sunset years who have been driving for a long number of years. Under the restricted category, these people need a driving licence to go to a church or a shop to overcome the isolation in which they live. I make a case for those people who should be facilitated in some way in this Bill and perhaps the Minister will examine this. There is talk of restricting the licences of learner drivers. Why not extend this to thousands of older people? Surely their driving could be confined to daylight hours and to a certain area of ten or even five miles.I have been approached by many older people who are morbidly concerned about the new changes in the regulation of the provisional licence system which, incidentally, I welcome. These older people have been driving without incident for 40 years. They more than likely bought their licence at a time when they could do so and they only travel limited distances. They feel that they are being unfairly discriminated against by these changes. They want a concession equivalent to young people waiting for a driving test who must undergo mandatory training and spend an interval before they can apply for the test to get their licence. Otherwise these older people, who are in their mid-60s or mid-70s and who live in remote rural locations will not be able to go to the shops or the church on a Sunday. That is all they require their driving licence for. They do not drink. They are unable to take the test because they say it is too complicated. There is no public transport system in those rural areas. They would settle for a limited test or a compulsory training programme. Their lives will not be worth living if the use of the car is taken from them or, in other words, if this essential lifeline is taken from them. Will the Minister consider those in such a position?Driver education in our schools is necessary. It is provided in other jurisdictions. It is not provided in this country and it certainly should be.Helicopter emergency medical services are an essential part of any programme to save lives. Helicopter emergency medical services are provided in every EU state except this country and the North. We hold that dubious distinction. There was a cross-Border study which showed that such a service would be feasible if done jointly by the two jurisdictions.Ring-fencing fines to the particular county in which those offences took place might help people understand that, if they are fined, the money paid will go towards the upkeep of the roads which might prevent accidents.I referred to the difficulty with this Bill that it does not address the fact that a person involved in fatal road traffic accident is not breathalysed. On a number of occasions I raised in the Dáil the case of Stephen Gray who was killed tragically when he was mown down by a driver who was never tested, even though that driver was seen in a number of public houses and at a nightclub. As a result, there is a petition, which has well over 20,000 signatures at this stage, demanding that the Minister change the law to ensure that anybody involved in a serious or fatal road traffic accident is breathalysed. That change in the law should definitely be made.I am also concerned that the Bill does not address the problem of people driving having taken drugs other than alcohol. Alcohol is the most common drug of abuse and its use has increased by 41% in the past ten years. I abhor the terrible consequences of drink driving and I know the effects of premature death.Gardaí, no more than in the case of breathalysing, cannot test someone for drugs unless they have some reason to do so, for example, finding drugs in the car. It is essential that there would be mandatory testing for drugs as well, and random drug testing. Just as there can be a road block for breathalyser testing, surely the same can be done for drugs. While I realise it is more problematic and impractical, with modern technology such a provision should be in place.I am well aware that there are people who are high on drugs driving around our cities and towns and even around rural areas. Ecstasy tablets, which are in common use and are freely available at €5 each, are reputed to give a high equivalent to eight or ten pints of beer, yet there is no way one can detect whether a person is high on ecstasy tablets. There are many young people on provisional licences with high motor insurance costs who are happier to use ecstasy tablets, at €5, on their nights out instead of drinking alcohol, which is expensive for them. With no alcohol in their blood, they have no fear of the breathalyser or of being caught.Random mandatory drug testing, as well as more gardaí to increase detection, would help. Leaving large areas of 20 miles without a garda encourages more drug pushing in rural areas. The lack of a dedicated drugs task force in Mayo as well as the lack of education of parents, insufficient gardaí and a failure to recognise the growing problem in rural areas is taking its toll. The Garda is doing good work with its education programmes but, without additional resources, it cannot do enough.I estimate that 50% of children in Mayo secondary schools who are regular drug users do not seem to be aware of the seriousness and the legal consequences of a drug habit. The increasing drug problem in rural areas is inversely proportional to the withdrawal of gardaí from rural areas. Even the stigma of getting caught is no longer a deterrent. Drug abuse is a particular danger on our roads, especially among the group aged 20 to 25 who drive regularly under the influence of drugs and who have little chance of getting caught. This Bill is no consolation to anyone who is concerned about that problem because the Garda has no reason to arrest anyone in the absence of a smell of alcohol unless drugs are found in a car. Smoking cannabis and using cocaine while driving is commonplace and the Bill will not address that problem.I am concerned by instances where young people have been killed on our roads and no one is held accountable. Aisling Gallagher, who was killed in Mayo, and Sinéad McDaid, who was killed in Donegal, died directly as a result of road traffic accidents caused by the road conditions. While the same may be said of the Kentstown bus accident, those two young girls in particular were killed through no fault of their own. Their cars were in perfect order, they were not speeding and they were breaking no laws. Their cars were perfectly roadworthy in each case, yet they were killed. No one is answerable in such situations. There is a protocol between the Garda and the Health and Safety Authority but, unfortunately, to date no one has been held responsible. An investigation is proceeding in the case of Aisling Gallagher while a Garda investigation has been reopened in the case of Sinéad McDaid.

Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an Teachta Morgan agus na Teachtaí Neamhspleácha ag iarraidh labhairt chomh maith.I acknowledge the presence of residents of many communities such as Ringsend and Sandymount in the Visitors Gallery. Waste management is a key issue in many areas and it will inform people in making their decision on who to vote for in the next general election. The Green Party has tabled the motion to outline a better way to manage waste and to highlight a blind spot in Government thinking which has made Ireland the dirty old man of Europe. The EU Environment Agency again this month found Ireland to be the worst state in the EU 25 for generating municipal waste, creating 735 kg per capita in 2003. The Government’s amendment refers to its record as remarkable progress but people will have to judge that for themselves.When debating the terrible death toll on our roads, no Minister would dare say that even one death is acceptable, yet the growing mountain of waste foisted on householders has resulted in no useful response from Government. Instead of adopting a strategy to reduce waste, Ireland has a policy of increasing waste. The growing amount of junk mail landing on our doormats every day without Government sanction is an example in this regard. I have witnessed in Canada how a strategy focused on reducing waste year by year to achieve zero waste in due course can work if political will and community empowerment are strong enough. People want to recycle and compost. The green schools programme is better supported by Irish schools than those of any other EU member state.Under section 29(4) and 29(5) of the Waste Management Act 1996, producers can be required to generate less waste, segregation of materials and diversion from landfill can be mandatory and local communities can be empowered to play their part in a zero waste strategy. Such a strategy would not require incinerators and hiding waste in huge landfills would also not be necessary.Lives are being ruined in my constituency by the Government's laissez-faire attitude to the growing waste crisis. In the Tooman-Nevitt area of Lusk where the current major dump for Dublin is located at Balleyally, eight more families will be evicted if the Government is permitted to build a new dump and further destroy lives, communities and the wider environment. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has said nobody wants to live near a landfill, yet he is prepared to sentence 13 families to live on the periphery of this new monument to Government failure to tackle the mounting waste crisis. However, a geological fault line has been discovered beneath the proposed 10 million tonne landfill site, which means groundwater from this part of Lusk feeds the Bog of the Ring underground reservoir on which many people in County Dublin depend for drinking water. This is also the Minister’s responsibility.No landfill liner membrane is guaranteed never to leak or to be punctured and, because of this, the EPA recommends that a minimum of 10 metres of clay be present on top of the bedrock to act as a filter for leakage from the dump. The Tooman-Nevitt site has as little as 4.5 metres of soil above bedrock in places and much less than 10 metres in others. Valuable archaeology on the site has also meant that, so far, 3 million tonnes, approximately one third of the dump's proposed capacity, has been forfeited by Fingal County Council. Unsurprisingly, 21 reports on this proposed landfill have been sent to the European Commission so far.The Green Party will make a logical case to deal with post-consumer materials as a resource rather than as waste to be thrown away. There is no such place as away. The Government has the legislation to minimise the waste problem but it must be instrumental in minimising the crisis. However, as my colleagues, Deputy Gormley, Green Party health spokesperson, and Deputy Boyle, Green Party finance spokesperson, will make clear, there are proven ways to reduce and tackle this avoidable problem and they do not involve a false choice between incineration and landfill. Waste reduction is where the solution lies, and it is for this reason we seek support for our motion.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. At a public meeting in Ringsend a number of weeks ago, I gave an undertaking on behalf of the Green Party that we would use our Private Members' time to table a motion calling on the Government to reassess its decision to grant approval for a public private partnership for an incinerator on the Poolbeg peninsula. Our motion goes further than that. It is a comprehensive motion which details the problems and difficulties with the Government's approach to waste management and offers a number of solutions. I convey my thanks and appreciation to residents groups in my constituency who have worked so hard on this issue and I express the hope that we will continue to work together on this campaign and bring it to a successful conclusion. I also thank the Opposition parties that have signalled their intention to support the Green Party Private Members' motion.Those who are genuinely opposed to the siting of an incinerator on the Poolbeg peninsula will support this motion. Deputy McDowell, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has issued quite a number of statements and newsletters to our constituents on this matter, insisting that he is opposed to the siting of an incinerator on the peninsula. This is his moment of truth and he has a number of options. He can choose to amend this motion as he sees fit but in a way which will ensure that no incinerator can be located on the Poolbeg peninsula. If he decides to toe the Government line, he will renege on a solemn promise given at the previous general election.Nobody should be mistaken that the Minister made the issue of the incinerator the central plank of his election campaign and we have all of the election literature to prove it. As befits a man who does not usually mince his words, he told the electorate that he would stop the incinerator. He also told us that Fianna Fáil could not be trusted to govern on its own and that he would use his influence at the Cabinet table to stop the incinerator. However, we are still waiting for this man of action to deliver and we have seen precious little action.If the Minister was so opposed to this incinerator, why did he do nothing to stop the granting of approval by this Government for the incinerator contract on the Poolbeg peninsula? It is untrue to claim that the public private partnership deal, which was granted to Elsam Limited, had nothing to do with the peninsula proposal. Replies to parliamentary questions I tabled demonstrate the PPP is directly linked to the Poolbeg peninsula. During this debate, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have an opportunity to make amends. I sincerely hope he will do so when the votes are cast at the end of this debate because I am tired of his posturing and the disingenuous nonsense in his newsletters to constituents. Reading these newsletters, one gets the impression, as only the Progressive Democrats can give, that somehow the Minister is a bystander in Government or, even better, a member of the Opposition.He claims the proposed incinerator is a mass burn incinerator not in line with Government policy. Well done to the Minister for spotting that. I am sure that took a lot of detective work. We have been saying it is a mass burn incinerator for years and, if it is not in line with Government policy and Fianna Fáil has managed to pull the wool over the Minister's eyes, as he implies in his newsletters, why did he give his assent to the public private partnership? Why did he not raise an objection? If, as he claims, Dublin City Council is not dealing properly with the ash problem, which is also something the Green Party has stated repeatedly, why has he allowed this process to continue?I have no intention of allowing the Minister to get away with such cute hoor politics where he pretends to the local electorate to be one thing and then acts differently in Government. It used to be called talking out of both sides of one's mouth and if the Minister were in Opposition, he would be the first to attack such politics.

He has betrayed the electorate to whom he made these solemn promises. Unless the Minister persuades his party to accept the thrust of the motion, it is clear that both Government parties are in favour not only of this incinerator but of all incinerators.The main reason the hazardous waste incinerator was given the go-ahead in Cork, was that it was Government policy. The planning inspector may have given 14 reasons it should not go ahead, but all these were overruled because of the Government's commitment to incineration. I fear that the proposal for one of the largest mass burn incinerators in Europe on the Poolbeg peninsula could go before An Bord Pleanála and that, although I could provide the best of reasons for opposing it, and there are many such reasons, which I will outline later, all could be ignored because of the Government's commitment to incineration.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, also claims that he used his influence to stop this proposal from being taken under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill. There are a number of points to be made about this claim. First, there is no evidence to suggest that the Minister did so. Replies to questions I have asked in this regard in no way indicate that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, could put a stop to this project. If the Minister's claims are correct, I ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who is present in the Chamber, to say if it is true. A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	278	Possibly more importantly, the processes for a public private partnership for a waste facility do not differ markedly from those which will operate under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill. Hence, it is not a big deal that this project will not be developed under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill. There is nothing to prevent Dublin City Council from using the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill for this proposal if it so wishes. If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government wishes to rebut or clarify any of these points, I would like to hear him so do.The Minister knows only too well that the last major infrastructural project on the Poolbeg peninsula has not gone as planned. The Taoiseach, the Minister and other dignitaries opened the waste water treatment plant — again the largest in Europe — with great fanfare. Since then, residents from the locality and beyond have been subjected to the foulest of odours from this plant which is running at capacity. One wonders how Dublin City Council and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who signed off on it, could have got it so badly wrong. However, they did so.The Minister appears to believe that big is beautiful because he has authorised the construction beside the sewage treatment plant of what will possibly be the largest mass burn incinerator in Europe. The building, and not merely its chimney stacks, will be the height of Liberty Hall and the length of Croke Park. The chimney stacks will be approximately half the height of the red and white chimneys on the Poolbeg peninsula. This will be a monstrosity, even in visual and planning terms. Moreover, this monster will require feeding for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for 30 years. For 30 years, Ireland's waste management strategy will be committed to incineration, during which hundreds of trucks will trundle through Sandymount and Ringsend daily and the costs of incineration will spiral beyond the original estimates.Although the Minister has made a mess of the sewage treatment plant, no one has been held accountable. No one has lost his or her job or has held up his or her hand and admitted guilt. This is a prime example of incompetence and a lack of transparency and accountability.Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats now want to repeat the trick. An independent expert, to whom reference was made in the motion, has stated that the costs given by Dublin City Council are inaccurate. The expert in question is Mr. Joe McCarthy, with whom officials in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be very familiar because he exposed the debacle of electronic voting and showed it could not work properly.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Will the Government ignore Mr. McCarthy on this issue? Will the Government plough ahead in the knowledge that Dublin City Council has not properly addressed ash disposal and CO2 emissions, to mention just two issues? Will the Government turn a blind eye? For every three tonnes put into the incinerator, one tonne, which must be disposed of in a landfill, will be returned. Therefore, landfill will always be part of the equation.The kind of landfill which the Green Party supports would contain no compostibles and would be very different. It would be so different that Professor Paul Connett, a waste management expert, refers to it as "clean fill". This is a landfill in which one sees no rats or seagulls and in which there are next to no leachates or methane emissions. Moreover, if the political will exists, this can be achieved. However, it is quite clear that the political will does not exist because not even the delivery of brown bins has been implemented. Where are the brown bins of which the Minister and others continually speak?As our knowledge of waste management techniques improve, it is becoming clearer that incineration is not a sustainable technology. How could it be sustainable to use energy to create products and then burn those products, thus wasting energy and creating CO2 emissions? We now have a unique opportunity to avoid making that mistake. It will mean changing the direction of society and the manner in which we conduct our affairs. Built-in obsolescence and the throwaway society must come to an end and industry will be obliged to clean up its act and assume responsibility for the products it makes. Many industries have realised that clean technology, as it has become known, can save money. It makes economic sense not to be wasteful. The argument is often used by proponents of incineration that environmentally friendly countries use it as a means of waste management. However, the same arguments have been used by those who support the nuclear industry.I refer to another problem of which the Minister has not taken account and to which a "Prime Time" television programme alluded. New evidence has emerged about emissions from incinerators which deal with particulate matter or very small particles. The particulates in question are much smaller than PM10s or PM2.5s. Dr. Staines, who was commissioned by the Government to perform its health studies, has stated that he has reassessed the evidence and now has a different opinion in respect of incineration. He now states that he would oppose incinerators, which is very significant.It is up to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Progressive Democrats, to put their money where their mouths are. I ask them to vote for this motion, which I commend to the House.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I represent a constituency in which the process of introducing two incinerators has become well advanced as a direct result of Government interference and policy making. My constituency is being asked to take the national toxic waste incinerator as well as a domestic waster incinerator on the same site for the Cork city and county area. It has been opposed throughout a Bord Pleanála process and an Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, licence process and is being challenged in the courts.However, as a representative for the area, I take issue with the processes that have taken place, especially the Bord Pleanála and EPA licence hearings. My colleague, Deputy Gormley, alluded to the unsatisfactory and inherently undemocratic nature of the Bord Pleanála hearing. Although a well respected planning inspector could itemise 14 grounds why a proposal should not proceed on sound planning principles, the board of An Bord Pleanála overruled him solely on the basis that it is Government policy to construct incinerators, regardless of the planning considerations. When such decisions tend to be made in a planning process which is meant to be participative and democratic, it is no wonder that public confidence in the decision-making process is undermined.I question the Cabinet's stance in this respect. My colleague, Deputy Gormley, has already spoken of the double standards applied by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My constituency colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, exhibits a similar need to limbo dance on this issue. He appears to state that such incinerators may be opposed in one's own constituencies although they remain Government policy. However, even the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated in public that he would not wish to see an incinerator in his constituency.Where stands collective responsibility on this issue? Has the Cabinet even voted on the matter? Has a decision been recorded, which Members can be shown, as to how and why this decision was made? I suspect it was a process of osmosis whereby the Government collectively decided on something which it thought would provide a quick-fix solution to a matter with which it would prefer not to deal.The Government's amendment is very interesting in that, for the first time, I note the admission, to which my colleague alluded in his contribution, that incineration does not get rid of landfill. In the past, I have never seen that as a plain statement of Government policy.

That has not been stated in any Government policy and it will be the reality for any incinerator likely to be built in this country in the coming years.Our motion outlines several areas in which the Minister can and should act but in which he has not. Legislation is available to him which would at least help to tackle the problem we face. This motion calls for the introduction of waste production regulations under sections 29(4) and 29(5) of the Waste Management Act, the establishment of waste deposit regulations under section 29(4)(f) of the same Act, the establishment of a waste reuse research and development programme under section 28(2) of the Act, and for legislation to be introduced regarding local authorities and waste management plans which the Government of which the Minister is a member sought to remove.I can anticipate what the Minister is likely to state in his contribution in that smug, supercilious way in which he usually lectures this side of the House. The reality is that his policies have failed——

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	291	The Government and the Minister have failed on a policy which sees more waste being produced. The insistence in the Government amendment on spurious statistics and the transport of huge volumes of waste to countries such as China being called recycling is something we need to examine through our political system. A huge confidence trick is being played on the people of this country. They need to see paper, cans, sheets of plastic and glass bottles recycled here in terms of future value added. The fact that this Government has not done so and shows no inclination to do so means that, until we get a change of Government and Minister with responsibility for the environment, we will add to this unnecessary waste mountain.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	292	It is a pity we do not have more time to debate this important issue but, unfortunately, that is how the cards are stacked in this House at present. I welcome the opportunity to address the waste management issue. I and my party fully support the motion.Many of the proposals in the motion reflect the demands of Sinn Féin in recent years. Greater provision of recycling opportunities, dealing with excessive packaging and returning power for making waste management plans to local authority members are very important. The last matter is what democracy should be all about because local authority members are the closest to the communities. They represent those communities and should have the power to make waste management plans.The Minister has an opportunity to deal with that specific issue. In 2003, I moved the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill which is on the Order Paper. Will the Minister take it, move it or provide time for me to move it? It will reinstate the power for making waste management plans with locally elected democratic representatives of the community. I am sure they will not introduce incineration.It is high time that sustainable waste management strategies which meet the needs of the population based on the logic of reduce, reuse and recycle were implemented. They need to make sense economically, socially and environmentally. We cannot simply bury or burn this problem any longer.I remember being a member of a local authority in 1999 and 2000 when consultants were wheeled out to wag the finger at local authority members and tell us we could no longer simply dig a hole in the ground and bury waste. What are we told now by those same consultants and experts when it comes to legacy waste from the nuclear industry? There is one safe option to deal with it and we need not worry because it will be safe. They will dig a hole and bury it under the ground because, as of now, they do not know how to deal with it. It will remain radioactive for thousands of years so a hole will be dug and it will be buried. Is that not hypocrisy?My party has been active on the issue of waste management for many years and supported courageous communities throughout the country, such as in Carranstown, Ringaskiddy and the Poolbeg peninsula. These people represent future generations. They are big-minded, unlike this Government. Some local authorities have demonstrated a positive approach to the issue of waste management. Galway is a glowing example. It now achieves approximately 54% recycling rates. This demonstrates what can be achieved if there is a will, leadership is given and people are provided with the infrastructure.The Government had ample opportunities to address the situation but the Minister and his predecessor failed to do so. The answer is not to dump waste in landfills or incinerators but to develop an all-island sustainable strategy based on the principle of reduction, reuse and recycle.Danger to our health and environment from incinerating is significant due to dioxins and carcinogenic emissions. The Minister knows all about it because we debated this many times before. However, he chooses to ignore it. He has not addressed the issue of residue waste from incineration. The rates for bottom waste and fly ash are 25% and 5% to 7% respectively. How this hazardous waste will be dealt with has not been outlined in any detail. However, more communities are driven into this tunnel.The public's concerns are real. This is not a shallow not-in-my-back-yard notion that people do not want ugly incinerators in their communities. Their concern is for the health and well-being of their communities and, in particular, their children. It is a scandal and an indictment not only of the Government but also of the State that the two issues of greatest concern to people, health and environment, cannot be considered by the planning authorities at planning application stage. What could be more important to any community or state? However, Government policy does not allow those two issues to be considered. It is obscene and should be changed urgently.The Government again displayed a skewed logic with the introduction of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Bill 2006. We will debate Committee Stage tomorrow and I look forward to it because it will be interesting. The Bill is a device to allow for the construction of incinerators and it will have a major impact on communities throughout the land. However, it is not only about incineration. It is also intended to use the Bill to trample on the rights of communities such as Rossport which will not now have an option under law of objecting to the threat to it from the pipeline.The Government heeds the financial interests of the financiers and speculators ahead of the fears and wishes of real people. We do not wonder about that. The real people of this State do not queue up outside the Fianna Fáil tent at the Galway Races every summer. We see from the list that the financiers and speculators do so.Generally, communities are not provided with infrastructure. Separated waste collection, as previous speakers stated, is not provided in the way it should be. Where civic amenity centres are in place, they work brilliantly. In my county town of Dundalk, in excess of 48 items can be recycled to the extent that one does not need to have a bin. Ample opportunity is provided for significant recycling. Drogheda has a new civic amenity centre and I have no doubt that the people of that town will choose to use it wisely.

We must ask who the polluter is. The Government tells us it is the person shopping, but I maintain he or she is not a polluter. The polluter is the person producing the excessive packaging in the first instance. The concept of incineration requires constant feeding. The idea of recycling will be lost. Local authorities will face financial penalties if they do not meet the huge demands of these incinerators. There will be a threshold and if that level of waste is not received, the local authority will be penalised financially. Is that logical? I hope the Minister replies to this.The Minister has powers under the Waste Management Act 1996 to ensure the prevention and minimisation of waste and to deal with exactly the type of packaging to which I refer. He has not chosen to use these powers, nor do I expect him to, even though it is only ten or 11 months until the general election.It is most unfortunate that we do not have more time to deal with this very important issue but I welcome the opportunity I have had to do so. I thank the Green Party for tabling the motion, which Sinn Féin supports.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I support the Green Party's motion, particularly the demand for the exclusion of an incinerator from Poolbeg in the south-side of Dublin city. I cannot think of a more inappropriate location for an incinerator. It is near the middle of the city, the most populated area in the country. The incinerator would produce toxic emissions, not to mention traffic congestion.The location of the incinerator has not been sanctioned in the Dublin City Development Plan. Although Dublin City Council opposes the project and while the Government amendment states the Poolbeg proposal will be the subject of an independent determination process by An Bord Pleanála and the EPA, the council's management has spent more than €10 million on the project, almost all on private consultants to promote it. It seems like a fait accompli to me, yet the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, postures and claims to oppose it totally.Communities across Dublin, including those in Ringsend, East Wall, North Wall, North Strand and Clontarf, are strongly opposed to the incinerator but they are denied any real say in the decision-making process. This is a classic example of the death of local democracy.On other aspects of the motion, I support the Green Party's view that legislation should be introduced to return powers to local authorities so waste management planning would be a reserved function of the elected councillors. I trust this will have the support of any future coalition in which the Green Party Coalition might participate.I support the establishment of a waste research and development programme to support innovative projects. An example of such a project arises in the Stoneybatter area in my constituency. Residents on Sitric Road have, without any State support, set up a marvellous, innovative composting and greening neighbourhood information project on a pilot basis. The goal is to cultivate an organic garden in a small railed-in space at the gable wall at the end of the road. Neighbours take their organic waste to the composting unit and vegetables, fruit bushes and trees are cultivated organically in a tiny urban space. The project has never been vandalised.This type of community effort could be replicated throughout the city as an informative, educational and environmentally sound measure, yet various State bodies, including the Minister's Department, the EPA, OPW and even Dublin City Council appeared not to be interested and were unwilling to assist when contacted.I support the Green Party's proposal that collection services for all domestic recyclables be free of charge. It is simply counterproductive to charge people for making the effort to recycle. This is one reason I opposed the bin tax and I believe the Green Party councillors who supported the Fianna Fáil proposal to introduce the bin tax at Dublin City Council were not acting in the interest of the policies they espouse. Deputy Gormley probably agrees with this.The bin tax is nothing more or less than a stealth tax and it has alienated a significant section of the community from the process of proper waste disposal. It has not worked in Dublin city, it is resented by many and should be abandoned.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I welcome the opportunity to speak to this very important motion. There is a problem in my constituency with practical implications. Kildare County Council's civic amenity centre in Athy in south Kildare was not opened for well over a year after its construction because the resources did not exist to run it. This year the council has set aside €620,000 to run the centre and it anticipates a grant of €100,000 from the Government. The running cost will therefore be somewhere in the region of €500,000. The scheme cannot be run on the cheap and none of us expects that it can. If one takes a long-term view on the running of landfill sites, even closed ones, one will realise that recycling makes sense.There is no civic amenity site in the entire constituency of Kildare North. Surveys conducted last year show some of the more enthusiastic proponents of recycling live in that constituency. The limited number of bottle, can and clothes banks were used extensively. Even if the council could cover the capital cost of a civic amenity site, it would not be in a position to run a second facility because it could not meet the cost. This is the reality.The combined population of the towns of Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock, which form only part of the constituency, greatly exceeds the population of Waterford city. The cluster of Naas, Sallins, Kill and Clane, which have a combined population of approximately 35,000, warrants such a facility, yet there is none available. There is no point in driving 20 or 30 miles to such a facility because this defeats the entire purpose.Kildare County Council had to postpone the introduction of the brown bin facility because it does not have the finances to run it. The will exists but the infrastructure is woefully inadequate. Despite the impression that Kildare is a well-off county, it receives one of the lowest transfers from the local government fund per capita and it is the largest contributor per capita from the motor tax fund. Some 36% of all motor tax collected in Kildare is spent elsewhere. The council obviously cannot afford basic facilities.Some years ago, Kilcock was identified as a location for a hazardous municipal waste incinerator. The €65 million proposal was to burn 150,000 tonnes of waste per year at a site 500 yards from the local primary school. I am thankful that An Bord Pleanála rejected the proposal in this case in 2000. Two positive results of the proposal were that people got together and adopted a more progressive approach to recycling and they informed themselves regarding the difficulties associated with incineration. These were the only positive outcomes of the proposal.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I refer to two points outlined in the Green Party's motion on waste management, namely, the setting down of obligations and targets for businesses and industry to produce recyclable, reusable and biodegradable packaging, and the establishment of a waste reuse research and development programme.The most favourable waste management option is waste prevention. If we do not generate waste in the first place, we do not have to deal with it. Therefore, if we invest in waste prevention and waste minimisation and ensure that packaging is recyclable, reusable or biodegradable, we will not create a major problem in the first place. This is simply good and common sense. However, it is not sufficient just to say it is common sense because we need to set down targets and obligations for producers, businesses and industry to ensure that they minimise the problem. As Deputy Gormley stated, this makes economic sense for them.Given that Ireland has one of the highest levels of municipal waste per capita, it is extremely important to concentrate on waste prevention and minimisation. Right now, however, we must deal with the waste we produce.Forfás produced a report this month on waste management in Ireland. It has benchmarked Ireland with nine other countries or areas and our performance is poor by comparison. We send 67% of our municipal waste to landfill. Only Scotland has a higher rate, at 86%, whereas Austria has a rate of 36%, Massachusetts a rate of 29%, Sweden a rate of 10% and Denmark a rate of 5%. While our recycling rate has improved since 2001, we still have a long way to go. Despite what is in the Government's amendment, we will have major difficulties in meeting the targets of the EU landfill directive.Let me refer to the role of local authorities in waste management. They are being starved of central Government funds. Indecon Consultants recently indicated a funding gap of €415 million for local authorities, which could rise to €1.6 billion within four years. Already, local authority charges are too high. Rates on business are increasing at a rate that is particularly punitive for the smaller indigenous business, which we rely on for sustainable jobs. The cost of waste collection is escalating, both for business and home owners, and will escalate increasingly unless central Government is prepared to meet its financial responsibilities to local authorities.

The contributions made by the tittering Member opposite is a particularly high example of that.The motion before the House in the name of the Green Party is a poor effort by any standard and the contributions have been poorer still.

It has one positive aspect in that, despite the attempts to shout me down, it shows that we have a very good story to tell in this country.We might have reasonably expected the Green Party, a party which claims copyright on environmental issues, to mount a well argued and well constructed case, but instead we got a sorry shopping list of misplaced ideas, misinformation, disinformation, distortion and half-baked ideas. Why bother with the real issues when one can indulge in fantasies ranging from the now well worn zero waste concept to whatever the latest hip idea is — the Canadian Guelph system being just the latest to prove irresistibly alluring to the Green Party? It did not deal with the system. There is a Canadian rock group known as the Tragically Hip. That would be a good description for the Green Party.

We have well and truly set out our stall in a suite of policy documents starting with the seminal document, Changing Our Ways, and culminating in the recently published national strategy on biodegradable waste, which clearly was not read by those opposite who made contributions.Unlike the eco-mysticism of the Green Party, our policies are grounded in the principle of integrated waste management. This focuses on waste prevention, a feature of our recent policy document, and minimisation as the main priority followed by reuse, recycling, energy recovery and utilising landfill as a last resort for residual waste. It is astonishing that any Deputy who wishes to be taken seriously in environmental issues would suggest that we have not mentioned that whole range in previous documents.

That is the start to prevention. Second, we have established a market development group — the issue of how we deal with recyclables was raised — aimed at developing a market development strategy for waste, although that was ignored by the Opposition.The Green Party states that Ireland has low recycling rates. That is a distortion of the facts. The claim either demonstrates simple ignorance of the facts that are in the public domain or it is a malign attempt to mislead.

When Fianna Fáil got back into government in 1997, the general level of recycling here was a pathetic 9%. When parties opposite were in government it was 9%, with 166,000 tonnes recovered. They almost reached 34% by 2004. That is 920,000 tonnes.

The Labour Party suggested we go back to the drawing board. To its credit, the Green Party supported me. It was the only party to do so. We were just one of three member states in the European Union that implemented the directive on time last August. It has defied the doomsayers and is working spectacularly well. In the period to the end of February, 15,000 tonnes of this waste was recovered for recycling and was recycled in this country. That works out at 6.7 kilos per person whereas the European target for 2008 is 4 kilos per person. At a minimum, they should have the courage to admit we have achieved incredible results in that area.In the area of farm plastics, my Department is funding a pilot open day scheme to allow farmers clear the backlog of uncollected plastic. That scheme is operating in a number of counties and will be expanded further later this year. It is phenomenally successful.In 1997, when Fianna Fáil returned to Government, 14% of packaging waste, or 93,000 tonnes, was recycled. In 2004, 56% or 479,000 was recycled. Preliminary figures from Repak indicate there has been a huge increase to the end of 2005, with an overall recovery figure of 64%, which is phenomenal by any standards. The figure means we are already exceeding the new targets in the amended packaging and packaging waste directive, which is set for 2011. Will the Green Party tell us how many other EU member states have come as far as fast as has Ireland.

Irish regulations require that packaging be designed and produced to permit reuse or recovery and to minimise impacts on the environment upon disposal of the packaging.It is worth reminding the House that the position on packaging in Ireland is aggravated by the reality that 75% of the packaging placed here is imported. I have asked Repak to bring forward further waste prevention and reduction proposals in its strategy covering the period 2006 to 2011. If Deputies paid attention to real recycling issues they would know that only last week Repak indicated in a series of documents circulated what could be and is being done, particularly by Irish firms in this area.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I note that the Green Party motion makes typically uninformed reference to the recently published Forfás study on waste management. Deputy Harkin, who left the House immediately after making her contribution, made equally ill-informed commentary. The study is interesting because it is a culmination of months of research into international waste management services. The report acknowledges that it is difficult to obtain up-to-date and readily comparable statistics in the area of waste management. It demonstrates that fact in the report. Deputy Quinn should note these are additional comments in my script which I make to illustrate the point about the inaccuracy of the comments made. The report further demonstrates that fact by making comparisons between 2005 figures for Ireland and 1995 figures for New Zealand. It is not to fault Forfás but to make the point that comparable data on waste management are incredibly difficult to get. Not only does Forfás recognise this, the European Environmental Agency, EEA, has also mentioned that reality. One of the major problems is that Ireland defines waste in a way different from other member states. One of the things that arises when we talk about a per capita figure is the inclusion of certain types of municipal and other waste as well as domestic waste in our statistics.The report acknowledges at several points — there are disclaimers on pages 8 and 9, if I remember rightly — that data from different countries are not always strictly comparable. The problem is accepted at EU level where efforts are being made to improve the consistency and the quality of waste generation data. It is important to make this point because the arguments that have been made in this House are facetious in that they are based on a poor reading, to say the least, of the Forfás report. What exactly does the Forfás study tell us?

However, high waste generation can generally be expected in a country with a booming economy. The study also demonstrates that other countries are able to achieve higher recovery rates and lower waste treatment costs than is possible in Ireland because they use waste in energy plants to reduce their reliance on landfill. The Green Party likes to indulge in selective quotations and ignore what is inconvenient. This includes the generally accepted view that our lack of incinerators is a major infrastructural deficit. That point has been made time and again by a variety of sources. It is one of the issues we must address, not dodge. What we have seen in this debate is an exercise in public deceit on this issue.An example of the progress in this regard is that the Dublin authorities are now progressing with the idea of an energy plant at Poolbeg. As has been made clear time and again, it will go through the normal planning process.

The alternative is to provide very significant additional landfill capacity for Dublin. This prompts an interesting question for the leader of the Green Party, because the issue has been mentioned about dumps in parts of County Dublin. How many more landfills do Green Party Deputies want to see constructed, especially in north County Dublin? We must dispose of the waste somewhere.

Ireland availed of a four-year derogation. What the Green Party ignores is that the targets set for Ireland in the biodegradable strategy are enormous and incredibly ambitious. They are targets which will be achieved. In Germany, on the issue of CHP, a Green Party environmental minister was happy to preside over a policy framework in which incineration with energy recovery was a key principle. Before leaving office, Mr. Jurgen Tritten courageously introduced severe restrictions on the use of landfill. It is a pity we could not do that here.

The Green Party's only alternative to the integrated approach is to talk about some nirvana to do with zero waste when the dogs on the road know this is nonsense. The party leader has opined that zero waste strategy will become the conventional wisdom — perhaps on his particular planet, but not in the real world.Zero waste became some sort of holy grail in the late 1990s and was about as credible as The Da Vinci Code in that a small number of British Commonwealth countries proposed that zero waste was an option. It is interesting now to examine the so-called zero waste domains. Canberra set targets to achieve zero waste by 2010. Municipalities in New Zealand followed with a target date of 2015. Nova Scotia was to lead the way in North America. Reality, an irritating concept that is foreign to the Green Party, soon intruded. Reality has a nasty habit of doing that. After some initial false dawns, the zero waste nirvana for those countries was never reached. We know that and the Green Party knows that.Unlike the Irish Green Party, however, the people who promoted zero waste in Australia, New Zealand or Nova Scotia knew when to stop digging. If one looks at their websites, one will see precisely what I mean. On the surface, the one most commonly referenced, Nova Scotia, is an impressive study which the Green Party is fond of citing. It seemed to have a very good target, and it did. It got to the 50% point very quickly but, after that, it got stuck. It should be remembered that Nova Scotia still has a dozen or so landfills. It has an incinerator in a province half the size of County Dublin. It has an incinerator——

Likewise in Canberra, where there was an impressive start, the reality is that we do not hear much of the fuss today. There are no magic solutions or magic bullets. We must look elsewhere for solutions to the real problems. Instead of trawling for obscure experiments from the far side of the world, we should look closer to home. The world's most environmentally advanced countries are fellow member states of the European Union. They operate under the same regulatory regime as we do. They have succeeded in combining high rates of recycling with safe and effective us of thermal treatment. Why do we not follow their example? Why is political leadership in this country prepared to suggest falsely that there is an alternative?

Properly engineered landfill will continue to have a residual role, but it makes no sense to resort to it for all waste. I have yet to hear a coherent response from the Green Party. It is quite incredible that a party supposedly dedicated to the environment should pursue policies that are going nowhere.Simple logic, which I know does not apply to the Green Party, tells us that operating state-of-the-art incinerators which produce electricity or district heating is infinitely preferable to burying our waste. We have no right to foist our waste on other countries or our children, which is what we do by depending on landfill. The waste to energy plants which are finally being advanced by the public and private sector will be subject to the most rigorous physical planning and environmental licensing regimes.

I compliment him on the various initiatives he has taken to develop the green agenda. The Minister has made substantial funding available to local authorities to assist them in the work they are undertaking.The public response has been very positive and people are adapting to a green agenda. They are willing participants with the local authorities to achieve what is necessary within their own communities. The local authorities have responded quite well due to the money they have been given. We must increase the pace of change in local authorities to respond to public support for the green agenda. I compliment the public officials in every local authority who had to convince the general public there was a need to change the culture of waste management. That response is mainly due to the Government's campaign and to the effort of those officials who brought the public on board to ensure people deal with their waste at home and in the recycling centres. I have seen the officials in schools in my constituency who have got the message about dealing with waste across to students. Those students go back to their homes and try out the new methods of dealing with waste. They are making a great contribution to their communities and they encourage others to adopt that green agenda.Local authorities will have to be encouraged to respond at a far faster pace to public demand in this area. The Minister has shown his commitment by making the funds available. There is no point setting out policy without providing funds to ensure it is put in place. We pass Bills and talk about policy, but often we forget about funding. It has not been forgotten in this case. Most local authorities have moved this agenda forward and are quite supportive.The WEEE directive, which I have seen first hand in Kilkenny, has gone way beyond expectations. All the traders in the city and across the south east have responded very positively to it. It shows there is public support for this and that the Government is pushing an open door. Much more needs to be done in local authorities to respond to newer demands from the public. We must look at our bureaucratic structure and at how large-scale environmental projects are dealt with. The Purcellsinch treatment plant in Kilkenny is an example of this as pollution in the River Nore is an issue. A new, modern plant is absolutely necessary. It has been debated for the last ten years, yet it has not been delivered. A total of €6.2 million in Government funding was made available for the project between 2000 and 2002, but because of the method applied to deliver such plants, we have yet to see it constructed.I would like private companies such as Diageo, which is a main player in this case, being up front with the required environmental impact study and admitting its particular stakeholding relative to all other stakeholders in that plant. It is unfair that such a company would hold the community to ransom just because it is not ready to provide its details in accordance with requirements, even when the local authority is ready to do so. This is a typical example of the civic support for such a development as the community is ready to drive it forward and to accept the plant. There is an onus on the private sector, as there was with the WEEE directive when those in business responded positively. As stakeholders, the company has a responsibility and it should respond quicker.A related topic is how the EPA responds to issues like this. A group in that agency deals with local authority breaches of regulations or breaches of legislation. The public do not perceive that process as effective or transparent and believe it protects local authorities. We must change these perceptions if we are to bring the general public on board in terms of the green agenda. I would like the EPA to investigate that council and process to ascertain the reason that project, essential as it is to Kilkenny, is not being delivered. I would like local authorities to play a more proactive role in tackling the indiscriminate dumping of waste throughout the country by people who refuse to play their part in supporting the community.I commend the Minister on what he is doing in this area. Much more work needs to be done but necessary funding is being invested by the Government and local authorities, as major stakeholders, should respond at local level.

I want to respond to issues covered in the Government's amendment, particularly the last part of it which refers to the system through which objections can be put forward.I will reflect briefly on the regional waste management plans. A criticism of those plans is that while each county council in the regions discussed those plans separately, the authorities collectively did not discuss those plans. Effectively, it emerged that one county was told an incinerator plant would not be located in its area but that a landfill facility would be located there. Another facility was to be located in another county and the location of an incineration plant was to be decided based on a regional waste plan and a strategy by a consultant who would decide where it might be sited. In the north eastern region that process was not followed. It was a case of pass the buck in terms of a proposed incineration plant and it transpired that the plant was not located on the site identified in the regional waste management plan but where private enterprise decided it should be located, which is near where I live. I was concerned about its location there, particularly when that location was not included in the plan. What is wrong with the system is that the structure is not clear. It was not part of the regional waste management plan that the proposed incineration plant would be sited in Poolbeg. That is the problem and the reason people are up in arms and concerned about it.A further issue is, namely, what were councillors told about proposed incineration plants. In County Louth at the request of our consultants P. J. Rudden, we visited incinerator plants in Denmark and in Germany. The plant in Germany was well known and it will remain in my mind. It was called Thermoselect and it was identified as a new modern process, well worth viewing and investigating. We went to Karlsruhe to view the plant. The incinerator looked fine but there did not seem to be anything moving though it. We were told there was a technical problem at the time and that everything was fine. We spoke to the manager and then went to listen to a briefing from the person representing the company. Councillors from County Louth and some of our officials were there when a Fianna Fáil councillor from Dundalk, the representative of Thermoselect, walked in the door. He told us why we should opt for the process used in this company in Germany. I wondered what was going on, what this councillor was doing there and what he knew about incineration. I did not know what was going on but I had no confidence in that company.

In fairness to this person, I am not suggesting he was corrupt. I am simply outlining what happened. On the day the county council was to vote on that issue, I took the liberty of telephoning the mayor of the city of Karlsruhe. I asked him about the Thermoselect incinerator and what, if anything, was happening there, to which he replied it was closed. I asked him the reason it was closed to which he replied it was in breach of regulations because it was discharging more than it should into the environment. Those of us in County Louth were concerned about that and we voted against the regional waste management on those grounds. In terms of the credibility and integrity of the process, it had none. That is the reason people are concerned. I can understand the reason Councillor Lucinda Creighton is upset and concerned, as is her community in Ringsend about the proposed incinerator. I know what is going on and members of the community there have not been consulted. They do not feel part of the process and the part of it that is left for them to go through is not as easy, obvious, transparent and fair as it might appear.In terms of that issue, protests are good, all fine and well and I attended one last Sunday, but they are not the answer. Mobilising the community is part of the answer, but the other part of it is to get people who have professional, academic qualifications to attend the oral hearing of the EPA and who can match, in every respect, the people whom they will meet there. Without such people and the necessary funds and if the fight is not at that level, one cannot win in this process.I make it clear that the health and environmental aspects of the proposed incinerator for Ringsend will be left to the tender mercies of the EPA not to An Bord Pleanála. When one goes to an An Bord Pleanála hearing, one will see 20 or 30 professional consultants, as we found, from Indaver. On our side we had a much smaller number but we did our best. The key concerns people have about incineration relate to the health aspects of the process, the discharges and dioxins. Those concerns were not addressed by the EPA because the EPA does not have and did not have on its staff any medically qualified person to deal with those issues and refute with certainty the arguments we made. The EPA said that the World Health Organisation's website states that this process is fine and therefore it is, and it can happen. I put it to the EPA that what it ought to do is to bring consultants into the process. It has the power to do this and the people in Ringsend should note this and request the EPA to bring into the process medical professionals they nominate or to seek internationally acknowledged knowledgeable consultants to be brought into the process to take part in the decision making process and advise on the process. The EPA was so arrogant that it would not do that. It did not do that, and that is part of the problem.For the honesty and integrity in the process and for the community that will carry this burden for the next 20 to 30 years, there is no final solution in terms of knowledge or satisfaction in the process in the manner in which it is structured. That is the reason people are up in arms, are concerned and the reason this process will not wash. I do not know the position of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who was mentioned, but he knows that people do not want the proposed plant. He is not here tonight to make his case against it, as he should if that is his view and if he represents his constituents. The reality is that until there is truth, integrity, openness and transparency about the process, it will not be acceptable.We will debate the critical infrastructure Bill, some provisions of which I welcome. We tabled amendments to it which, I hope, will clarify many of these issues. However, if the community concerned is only to get grief as a result of engaging in this process and if it does not have its concerns addressed significantly and directly, it will never accept or be happy with this process. However, that is not to say that we should not deal with the waste issue. I accept that we must deal with it. We cannot forever bury our heads in the sand on that issue. However, if we deal with it, we must do so in an honest, open and fair way. Under this process, that is not happening.In the case of the incinerator at Carranstown, the decision to site an incinerator there in an area that was zoned agricultural came out of the blue. It was not zoned for industrial development. Nobody could anticipate or expect that area would be a location in which one would find an incinerator. One would expect to find an incinerator in an major urban area or in the centre of an industrial zone, but that was not the case in this instance. In such waste management issues there must be certainty in terms of knowing where such plants will be sited and members of Government must accept responsibility for them. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, does not accept responsibility for this proposed incinerator yet he is part of the process. One cannot fool all one's constituents on issues such as this all the time. We need to have honesty in this matter. I am aware that Councillor Lucinda Creighton and members of her community are listening. The way to proceed is to protest, march and carry placards but if they do not have experts and expertise on the day and do not insist that the EPA does its job, they will not win this battle.The motion is mischievous in giving credibility to a process that does not bring the health and environmental aspects to the front of the argument in a transparent and open way. The EPA has failed miserably in what it has done heretofore and will fail again. It is a sad case.

However, the Government introduced legislation which took the responsibility away from members of local authorities and gave it to city and county managers who, when the Minister tells them to jump, ask "How high?" They jump to do what the Minister wants and this happens throughout the country. Local authority members have been bypassed.Further legislation was introduced to remove people like me, Deputy O'Dowd and others from local authorities. Now we can no longer liaise between the Dáil and the local authorities with regard to what the Minister says in the Dáil and what he says to city and county managers, assistant managers and everybody else he meets on a regular basis.

Connacht may not have needed to adopt it because the consultants' proposed solution to the region's waste problem was for an incinerator in Galway city and a landfill site in Galway county. It was easy for Sligo, Roscommon, Mayo and Leitrim to vote and support that. Why would they not do so.Each local authority and county should be responsible for the disposal of its own waste. That would be a greater encouragement to people to reuse, recycle and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. I was a member of Galway City Council for a number of years and of Galway County Council. I am proud of my record on Galway City Council which has achieved a 60% reduction in what goes to landfill. It achieved this because the people were willing to do it.Towards the end of the Minister's speech, he appeared to take credit and implied the Government was responsible for people reducing waste. The Government had nothing to do with it. It was local authorities that did it.

We succeeded so well that we have now reduced this to three bins per house, a composting bin, a small landfill bin which will be charged for by weight thereby providing people with an incentive to reduce their waste further, and a recycling and reusable bin. This, as I said, has reduced the amount going to landfill in Galway city by 60%. The same will be achieved in Galway county and in any county that wants to work this way. There is goodwill towards this system and the people respond to the lead which local government authorities give in this regard.The Government is failing greatly with regard to the next step after areas achieve the 50% reduction in waste. The Minister said some countries have got that far and have not gone further. The solution to the next step lies with the Government. It is up to the Government to support facilities for the reuse and recycling of the other 50%.

We must put incentives in place to encourage facilities such as the recycling of plastics into new plastic products, rather than having to separate materials and then export them because there is no incentive from the Government to enable private enterprise or local authorities to set up such facilities so that people can reuse the materials recycled in the various areas.The Minister asked in his speech where we should look now and pointed out that instead of trawling around the far side of the world, it made sense to look at what works. Of course it makes sense to look at what works. It is the Minister's duty to lead the way in supporting local authorities and people who are enthusiastically making an effort in this regard.

It is written into the county and city plans for Galway that there should not be an incinerator in Galway county. Where do the regional plans stand now?

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The ever-increasing number of fatalities on our roads, the number of accidents and the large number of people suffering serious injury as a result of those accidents rightly concern everyone in this House. No Member or political party should be engaged in trying to score political points on the back of people's suffering. However, criticism of the delay in introducing necessary legislation is valid. This is a long-awaited Bill, which the House should have dealt with well before now. It contains many provisions, which the Green Party supports. We have concerns, as already expressed by other Opposition speakers that some of the difficulties with existing road safety legislation may be repeated in many of the new provisions here.We live in a difficult time where bad existing legislation is being challenged and members of the Judiciary on the basis of sound judicial principles are making decisions on drink-driving and speeding charges resulting in many cases brought by the Garda being struck out. Many of the hoped for effects of people not driving with excessive speed or with any alcohol are being totally undermined on foot of these decisions. This places a greater challenge on us as legislators to come up with the right type of legislation and not only words in a Bill that will make us feel better about the nature of the problem that needs to be resolved. There must also be confidence that this legislation when enacted can be enforced, both in terms of the resources necessary to ensure the Garda can bring charges and that subsequently when any actions are brought before the courts they can be prosecuted on the basis of sound judicial and constitutional principles. Unfortunately doubts remain in this regard.The Bill introducing several new measures will be largely unopposed in this House and the Green Party will facilitate its passage. We will use the opportunity on Second, Committee and Report Stages to ask the Government to be more forthcoming about its confidence over how judicable the measures proposed are and whether the legislation can fill the many gaps that remain. One source of potential difficulty relates to the proposals on drink driving and the creation of distinctions between people on lower and higher blood-alcohol levels as well as the right to opt for on-the-spot fines and bans rather than going to court. Owing to the potential difficulties, there could be a role for the Council of State in ensuring the Act is tested before it is challenged by a citizen.The Green Party's main criticism is the delay in introducing several of these measures including, for instance, the delay in random breath testing and the ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving. Over the years the Government has pointed to difficulties in introducing these measures. While the Minister's speech made no mention of it, it might be forthcoming in later presentations as to why what was difficult before is now possible. If difficulties still exist, what are they and how can they be overcome? The length of these delays has been unacceptable. The delay for random breath testing has been six years. It was first mentioned by Deputy Brennan when he was Minister for Transport. The first mention of a ban on the use of hand-held mobile phones was made by the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Mr. Bobby Molloy, before the last general election. After nine years in office, the Government parties should ask the reasons for such delay and prevarication. Have such delay and prevarication resulted in scenes on our roads that could have been avoided?Many people have felt frustration at the driver-testing system. It must be admitted that the Government seems to be addressing the problem or at least getting exercised about it. The recent proposals made by the Minister and the agreement with the Department and the unions on driver testing might result in what has been an intractable problem emerging from the tunnel. The Government seems to be putting regulation of driving instructors on the long finger. It will not start until July 2007 and will be completed by 2008. As this is June 2006 and we will have a general election in the interim, I do not know why the Government believes it will take so long to implement.As mentioned by other speakers, a major omission from the Bill is the lack of provision for drug testing of drivers. I have yet to hear an explanation from the Minister as to whether this relates to concern about the lack of appropriate technology or whether there are constitutional issues concerning a difference between testing for drugs and for alcohol. If there are difficulties it would be more honest for the Minister to take them to the floor of the House so we could collectively try to address them. Otherwise it will represent a huge lacuna in legislation we pass this week.The disagreement between the Departments of Transport, and Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the issue of speed cameras and the involvement of the private sector has been unacceptable. As a result the idea has yet to come to fruition. The Committee of Public Accounts, of which Deputy Fleming is a member, has considered the practice of existing policy in this area. Currently someone challenging a speed conviction through the courts has a 90% chance of success in overturning any penalty imposed. Especially given the involvement of the private sector, the new proposals do not give me confidence that this is likely to change.Another omission relates to the arbitrary way local authorities determine speed limits in their jurisdictions. There is a lack of consistency. We have similar types of road with different speed limits depending on the local authority area. People are asked to speed up and slow down on small stretches of road. While that was an innovation of a previous Road Traffic Act, the opportunity of seeing how that system has worked or failed in different parts of the country should have been addressed in this Bill. This may yet change on Committee and Report Stages. I would have liked the Minister to have made positive proposals in this area.The biggest fear is that of legal challenges. As a representative from Cork, I am particularly concerned that drink driving charges were thrown out by Cork District Court. The judge in question, as the person with knowledge and experience, was entitled to and probably justified in making the decision but it was a particularly unfortunate decision given that road deaths in Cork city and county were higher than the national average in the past year. When people are walking away from a court, with drink driving cases brought by the Garda not being tested, I fear the Bill will not address our ongoing concerns.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Road Traffic Bill 2006 and propose to highlight some of its key features. The Bill facilitates the introduction of mandatory roadside breath tests for drivers for alcohol in a targeted manner and provides for the introduction on a statutory basis of control of the use of mobile telephones and in-vehicle communication equipment by occupants of motor vehicles. It also establishes a framework for the engagement of private sector interests in the provision and operation of cameras and other technology for the detection of speeding offences. It provides for the adoption of a new fixed charge and disqualification for certain drink driving offences, an increase in periods of disqualifications relating to drink driving offences and other serious driving offences and the introduction of broader powers for the Garda to detain vehicles. While the legislation has several other features, I consider these its main provisions and all are justified, worthwhile and necessary.The reason for this Bill, a further element in the suite of road traffic legislation passed in recent years, is the tragic number of deaths on the roads. Every person will have known someone who died in road traffic accident. There is not a town, village, street or townland in which a young person has not left for work in the morning or gone out in the evening never to return home because of a road traffic accident. This issue is, therefore, close to the hearts of many families. In this case, legislation passed in the House will have a significant impact on lives and will show that Members take seriously the tragic consequences of the large number of road traffic accidents on our roads.I welcome the introduction of mandatory roadside breath tests which are long overdue. Although I have no legal expertise, I fail to understand the reason it has taken so long to address this issue. Why has the legal profession engaged in arguments about whether such tests should be allowed or are constitutional, how random should be defined and whether the number of tests should be carried out on the basis of the number of cars in a county or on every road in the country? I am tired of legal experts having debates which recall the question as to how many angels can dance on the head of a pin at a time when lives are being lost on our roads every day. I am also critical of the Judiciary which is more interested in entertaining these types of debates in courtrooms than convicting defendants when the substance of the case shows them to be guilty.I welcome the provision on breath tests. I am pleased it was cleared by the Government's legal advisers and I look forward to its implementation. I particularly welcome the provision allowing persons found during a mandatory roadside breath test to be over the legal limit to voluntarily accept a fixed penalty, including disqualification from driving for a specified period. Those who avail of this option will be taken to court and, I hope, given short shrift from the judge and made to realise the consequences of their actions.Issues of this nature should not be tested to an excessive degree in the courts. I hope people caught over the legal limit will accept the yellow or red cards the authorities promptly show them. While it is the right of individuals not to avail of the voluntary option and take their chances in court, I hope they will meet judges who are more interested in enforcing road traffic law than finding legal loopholes which would allow defendants to be acquitted.I am concerned that this Bill and road traffic legislation in general does not deal with those driving while under the influence of drugs other than alcohol, including cannabis, hashish and ecstasy. This has created a legislative gap which allows many young people and others to smoke a joint or two at the weekend and drive without fear of prosecution. The House will have to surmount this problem in due course because the Bill does not provide for the introduction of a mechanism to address it. It must be given further thought and should be referred to an all-party committee for consideration. Every responsible Member will agree the issue must be tackled. I would be surprised if any Deputy opposed a proposal that would result in the prosecution of those who drive under the influence of hard drugs.I expect one of the difficulties of any such proposal would arise in the area of drug testing. While I am aware that tests can identify the presence of some harder drugs in the blood, some of the drugs coming on the market are combinations of cannabis and other drugs. It is not, therefore, a matter of developing a simple blood test which would identify the quantity of a specific drug in the blood as it would be difficult to devise an overall test to identify all drugs. I would like those involved in the technical analysis of drug samples to assist an all-party committee in addressing this issue.While I support the provision requiring a person who voluntarily accepts a fixed term disqualification to return his or her licence to the local authority, I am concerned about what will happen to such licences once they are submitted to the local authority. What mechanism will be used to ensure their return? The Bill makes no provision in this regard and I am certain insufficient resources will be available on the ground to implement this excellent idea.Every time I raise the issue of road taxation, insurance or driving licences I am reminded of a case referred to me several years ago by a constituent whose insurance company cancelled a policy after several months. The reason given by the company was the failure of the policy holder to disclose all relevant information. The policy was cancelled, the balance returned and a document notifying the cancellation of the policy issued. I followed up the matter by tabling a parliamentary question asking how many insurance policies had been cancelled by insurance companies in the previous year in respect of vehicles which were still on the road. I was stunned to learn that between 10,000 and 12,000 policies had been cancelled. The practice was most common among the larger insurance companies. I would like to find out what is the current figure. A simple parliamentary question would extract this information.There is a mechanism in law providing that an insurance company which cancels an insurance policy must notify the relevant Garda station to ensure local gardaí are aware of the cancellation as the former policyholder's car will continue to have an insurance disc displayed on the windscreen. In a number of cases, people have agreed to pay for insurance policies on a 12 month basis but, after making the first payment and receiving their insurance disk, their policies were cancelled because they stopped making payments. Insurance companies are using this legal provision as a means of debt collection, with the result that thousands of notices are being sent to Garda stations throughout the country about drivers with lapsed insurance. However, no mechanism is available on the ground for following up these notices. I am concerned that the provision to require people to surrender their driving licences to local authorities will fall into similar disrepute. I understand gardaí have other duties but this system is a shambles. When a company issues an insurance policy, the problems it faces in collecting debts should not impact on other road users in terms of cancelled policies. I would like that issue to be addressed in future road traffic legislation.I welcome the Bill's provision to give the powers to the Minister to make regulations on mobile telephones and other communications equipment. That will allow the Minister to respond quickly rather than be forced to introduce primary legislation to respond to changes in technology. The ambulance service and gardaí are exempt from prosecution under this section but I would like to know whether private ambulances and Defence Forces and prison service vehicles are also exempted. Such vehicles may be covered by the Bill's provision for a defence of genuine emergency. I am happy that penalty points will apply in respect of using a mobile telephone while driving as soon as this Bill is enacted.I welcome that the Bill deals with the role of the private sector in the operation of speed cameras because limited Garda resources should not be wasted on this area. It is not a security issue but a technical job which should be awarded to a company through competitive tender. However, certain issues will have to be addressed, such as whether private operators will have access to information on penalty points.As Deputy Boyle noted, the Committee of Public Accounts investigated the speed cameras currently in operation and figures from the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated that nearly 50% of the photographs taken by speed cameras did not result in prosecution. Excuses given included bad weather, glare on cameras and heavy rain or snow. The remaining 50% of photographs taken include people who denied they were driving the car at the time, cars from other jurisdictions and faulty or unclear number plates.I am concerned that the lack of quality control may continue into any new system. We should not try to reinvent the wheel but should learn from countries with similar climates. As I have learned from the Committee of Public Accounts, the public sector is not capable of introducing quality information technology systems. The Department of Transport and the Garda are not information technology experts and the lack of competence in the public service has meant projects are not properly specified from the outset. Rigorous assessment is needed before projects go to tender.I am happy that fines are being increased in respect of expired licences. However, why cannot local authorities issue reminders to people when their licences are about to expire? It is easy to leave a ten year licence in the glove compartment and forget about it. Local authorities are well able to issue us with reminders to tax our cars and insurance companies remind us about our insurance policies. There is no reason, other than inertia, why reminder notices are not issued for driving licences. It is a lazy approach to merely increase fines without making provision for reminders.It is welcome that gardaí are to be given greater powers to take uninsured vehicles off the road if they are not registered in this State. I would also like to see a provision whereby such cars can be put into private storage. I have visited several Garda stations in my constituency only to find their yards half-filled with abandoned vehicles because there is no provision in law to allow gardaí to store them anywhere else.The Bill does not address the issue of insured drivers. I have open insurance, which allows me to drive any car, insured or otherwise. The Bill deals with uninsured vehicles but many drivers can be insured to drive any vehicle. I understand the intention behind this but the provisions have not been properly thought out.In recent weeks, the Judiciary has caused the majority of the problems encountered by the Houses of the Oireachtas. One judge decided to let a person out of prison, only to have other judges reverse that decision. This inconsistency causes many problems. If a person is being tried for speeding or drink driving, that should be the substantial issue considered by the judge. However, most judges seem to be more interested in asking whether the garda properly identified himself or herself or gave the proper receipt to the defendant. All this must be considered. The Judiciary seems more interested in the minutiae of legal debate than the substance of the offence. It should use common sense in these cases. The substance of the offence should be examined in the correct proportion to technical issues.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I have been a Member for 15 months and road deaths have been an issue in this House every week since I was elected. I have compiled a list of the names and addresses of 174 people who died on the roads since 1 January, from a two year old child to a 95 year old man. This Bill should lead to a reduction in the road deaths in every parish, which affect everybody. I assure Mr. Gay Byrne that the Opposition has no intention of holding up this Bill. We must ensure that every aspect of this Bill is implemented so that this country is no longer one where 11 people per 100,000 die on the roads, compared to the European average of six people per 100,000. People will no longer be six times more likely to die if they travel by motorbike in this country compared to any other country. The Opposition will hold people responsible if the measures discussed are not implemented immediately.We must address driver testing, speeding, drink driving and the quality of our roads. Last week a breakthrough was made. The testing of our young people has been a shambles over the past number of years because people did not wish to address the situation. Young people have no respect because of the manner in which they have been treated. A 52-week wait is unacceptable because they are charged extra by their insurance company in the meantime. Addressing this will garner respect from young people.I do not know when 40,000 tests will be outsourced. An additional 10,000 applications were added to the waiting list last year. It is essential that the Minister works with these people seven days a week so that every young person can be tested within a six-week period. Fine Gael calls for a place where people can learn to drive under proper instruction, as is the case in Hong Kong. Inexperienced drivers would not have to learn on busy roads. If we do not see a reduction in waiting times, someone will have to answer.A speeding blitz has taken place over the past few bank holiday weekends. Despite this and the increase in the number of penalty points for certain offences, the number of people killed has not decreased. Penalty points are being picked up where one drives a little above the limit. Every time one drives on a dual carriageway, someone is waiting around the corner with a speed gun. Where I live, on narrow roads where only one car can fit and the speed limit is only 80 km/h, one meets dangerous drivers. The people on this list of victims were killed in such places, on minor roads where no traffic corps operates and proper speed limits are not enforced. We have discussed getting planning permission from county councils to ensure proper speed limits. That will cost money.Some 33 years ago yesterday, at 16 years of age, I witnessed a two-year old child being killed while crossing the road in Bettystown. The speed limit on that road is the same now as it was then and there are no ramps. That child has not been forgotten by her parents. We must have traffic calming measures outside our schools and the traffic corps in places beyond the edges of our cities.It is a liability to drive in the country at weekends. There are crazy drivers on our roads, on motorbikes and in cars, young and old people trying to make up time on country roads at weekends. Until we address this, the list of victims will continue to grow. We must ensure speed limits are in the right place. Garda resources, including recruits, must increase. This will provide the back-up to ensure that the speed limit is implemented on every road in Ireland. Everybody must uphold the law.As a publican living in the country, I believe people have become more responsible. Young people and older people of my age have been caught. From talking to fellow publicans, sales have halved because people of my age have stopped drinking in pubs. They know they cannot drive after drinking more than three pints. The trade is going to die but if it means saving lives, so be it.This Bill contains aspects that seek to punish more severely those caught. We must make examples of those who consistently drink and drive. If a person is caught, he or she should be punished. In the event of a second offence, the punishment should be doubled or trebled.Some 12 years ago my wife and I came across an accident while travelling to a function. A man had been driving while stone drunk and a girl who was the passenger was trapped in the car. It took half an hour for the ambulance to arrive. While the drunk driver would not acknowledge me, my wife or the garda, the girl slowly died as we watched the blood drain from her. The driver was banned from the road but exactly one year ago the same driver spent the day in the pub before driving a car he did not own and crashing into my father. My father was left to die at 81 years of age and the driver took to the fields. After many of us chasing him, the Garda Síochána arrested the man. When questioned, after finally accepting that he had been driving, his first question was who would pay for the damage to his car. That man cannot be prosecuted because my father would have to go to court to make a statement. These people must be put away without being given a second chance. When dealing with such people stiff penalties are required.I have debated the issue of the quality of Irish roads and road signs for the past three or four months. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Cullen, as he left the Chamber. Everybody is beginning to agree. This is the matter that will really test this Government and test Gay Byrne's resolve to remain as chairperson. Until this is addressed, there will be carnage on our roads.I was in Roscommon, Longford, Meath, Monaghan, Louth and Cavan in the space of two days and it is not different in any county. Contractors who are given a job to do on a road are paid nearly by the square inch and, when they apply tarmac, the sides of the roads are left unfinished. Everybody knows what I am talking about. It is a council's responsibility at the end of the day and Fine Gael in Government will ensure that every county council will be responsible for its roads.When contractors finish their job, the margins are not filled in. If a young or nervous driver pulls in to the side of the road to facilitate an oncoming lorry, the car hits the bank and veers out onto the road again. That is what happened two months ago to my neighbour aged 30 who is on the list to which I refer. He went in off the road to avoid a car, hit the kerb which did not hold, his car veered out and he ended up being killed. According to EU statistics, the bad roads and bad road signs of this country are responsible for 30% of deaths.It is a pity the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government did not hold out. The Minister for Transport cannot do this on his own. We must have a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is prepared to provide more gardaí to ensure that speeding and drink driving are not issues, but we must have Ministers for Finance and for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who are prepared to fund repairs to the roads.The roads are a disgrace. It is the one area which has been let deteriorate. It is usually the one on which action is taken before local elections. I remember, even when I was aged ten, that upcoming local elections meant one could guarantee the boys would be out working on the roads. I suppose we must wait until then to see it happen again. There are potholes the size of small lakes in every county and one could fish in them at this stage. Given the amount of money available to the Exchequer, I cannot believe that roads are an issue.Road signs are another issue. Last week a man was brought to court for cutting back hedges. This prosecution was taken under legislation protecting birds, with which I agree. Despite this signposts on every small road in Ireland are covered with white weed. No councils fulfil their responsibility anymore because there are no people on the roads with scythes or strimmers to cut the weeds. People have had accidents and are being killed.I will always remember that, in my parish of Nobber, five people from one family — a mother, her two children, her sister-in-law and her niece — in one car came to a crossroads in Monaghan where there were no proper road signs. They went through it and were killed. The five of them were brought into the parish church in Nobber in one bunch. One can no longer go through that crossroads because it has been made a staggered junction, but it is too late for that family. Across the Border and in England, every road is marked. I crossed into south Armagh the other evening to do a job and the first thing I encountered was a small byroad which was signposted.As one approaches a stop sign from a distance, it is the size of a sixpence. If we want to reduce road deaths, we must put up proper signs at every junction on every road, from Kerry to Donegal. We have tried drink driving and speeding campaigns. Everybody knows about those issues but the numbers of deaths on the roads are increasing. According to the EU figures, 30% of road deaths are caused by bad roads and bad road signs. As Ireland's roads are worse than everyone's, I can clearly state from the heart that 40% of the deaths in this country are due to bad roads and that is our responsibility, at local and national levels.There are counties like my county of Meath that cannot afford to spend money on their roads because they do not have an adequate rate base from jobs. My county, I am ashamed to say, has the worst roads in Ireland. It would give me great pleasure to bring Deputy Olivia Mitchell or any Minister down the byroads of County Meath. The Minister would be ashamed of his life, yet he sees our council is in debt owing to the lack of employment. That is why I say it is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who must be responsible for ensuring that, where counties do not have the money to invest in these roads, it is done at national level.As I said last week, there is no point in stating in this House on budget day all the money that is available while the list to which I referred continues to grow. It will continue to grow and will affect my family, that of the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, or someone else's family. We will continue to state weekly in this House how terrible it is. Looking at that list, it strikes me that there should be an immediate audit of where all these accidents occurred, why they occurred and a photograph of where they occurred. I noted that 22 or 23 of these people were killed in Cork, which is an area that could be examined.The Road Traffic Bill is specifically to provide for what we, as Deputies, have had to speak about weekly. For the previous 47 years of my life, I probably witnessed as many road deaths as anybody. No doubt everyone in this House has come across them on occasion. Ireland has the worst record — 11 persons per 100,000. The European average is six persons per 100,000. One is six times more likely to be killed riding a motorbike on a road in Ireland than anywhere else.One cannot blame the Irish people for everything. Although I do not say the Government does so, everything documented, even in the Bill, seems to address the driver or the young person. I say we are responsible. The number one priority of county councils, whether controlled by Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn Féin or whoever, should be to ensure that every road our children take, whether by minibus, car or whatever, is safe. They are not.As Fine Gael spokesperson on safety, I can guarantee that we in Fine Gael will ensure when we are in Government that every county council will be made responsible for the roads of this country. Instead of putting up flowers, with which many councils decorate the middle of a town, they will be filling in every pothole in every county. They will ensure that the verges of every road are properly filled in. We had a visitor from America who could not believe that we do not ensure that roads are finished, not just in the centre but to a tee.Every road should be marked. I live on the N52 which is marked on the left-hand and right-hand sides with yellow illumination and down the middle in white, and driving home in the evening is a pleasure. Whether frosty or snowy, whether dark or bright, one knows where one is going. This Bill must be implemented to ensure that the list of people to which I refer is reduced. Over the past six years, 700 people died because of bad roads. They should not have died.The legal side of this must be handled in dealing with drink driving. Speeding must be handled by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, by ensuring that gardaí patrol the streets and are given support. It is not good enough to have them patrolling the dual carriageways, handily catching people going home. They must patrol rural areas where people are being killed on bad roads or on roads where the speed limits are inappropriate. We must ensure that families do not have to go through the trauma that the families of the people in the list to which I referred went through.At this stage, everybody must work together and there is no point in being nice about it. I welcome this great legislation. I had the pleasure of sitting through Noel Brett's presentation for two hours last week because the new board has everything covered under the chairmanship of Gay Byrne. We, in the Opposition, will not stand in the way of this legislation but we will hold Gay Byrne responsible for ensuring everything the board requires is provided. All the provisions in the legislation in addition to the requirements of the authority must be implemented to ensure our people are safe on the roads, otherwise 450 people will die again next year.
#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. As the Minister for Transport stated, this is the most important legislation to come before the House for a long time. It deals with driver negligence, which is the major cause of fatalities on our roads, and contributory factors such as driver error, drink driving and so on. As long as we look for excuses, we will never deal with those who are causing the fatalities. As long as they are given an out and told it was not their fault they were drink driving because they left a public house at 2 a.m. or it was not their fault that they drove a car into a ditch while driving at 80 mph because the road surface was bad, we are in trouble. We will never resolve this issue and until the blame is placed where it should be, which is on every driver, we are fighting a lost cause.All Oireachtas Members are concerned about road safety because every time we read a newspaper or watch a news broadcast, we are reminded of the issue. Every road accident must be fully analysed. I asked the Minister if he would consider using the Health and Safety Authority to conduct the technical assessment of every fatal accident or dangerous occurrence on the roads. I used my experience as a former industrial safety officer to bring that proposal forward because a body used to dealing with similar incidents is required. The Garda must consider the legal issues and take measurements and so on for court cases but the analysis of accidents will lead to a solution in the long term. When Members refer to statistics that highlight that 30% of fatalities are due to bad roads, that will not get us anywhere.

#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	451	The legislation will assist in this regard. Because of the mixture of complex issues involved, it is important the legislation can ultimately stand up to minute scrutiny, particularly in the courts. It is a matter of huge concern to the public and Oireachtas Members that road traffic offences, which have been legislated for in the Houses, have been dealt with in an inconsistent fashion by the courts. Every amendment to road traffic legislation, whether it concerns speeding or drink driving, is inevitably challenged with cases often passing through the hierarchy of courts. Every attempt is made to find a loophole that legal professionals always feel exists. Each of the Departments involved in the legislation, the Garda and the State's legal advisers will try to ensure legislation is watertight. Fortunately, we have a Constitution but, given the ability of a number of our legal minds, that can create a difficult proposition when implementing legislation such as this.While all the various legal challenges are dealt with in the courts, people are dying on the roads at a frightening rate. Everybody must accept that motoring offences are serious and if legislation is challenged, the challenge must be dealt with speedily by all involved, including the Garda, the courts and the legal profession. It is scandalous that such challenges can be delayed for two or three years. That is totally unacceptable and cases must not become statute barred. In particular, 500 or 600 out of 1,800 cases were statute barred in recent years and that should not happen. There is total confusion in the minds of the public regarding various offences because of the various defences put forward in court, although everybody should be able to defend himself or herself. Reference has been made to how other countries deal with such offences. The US is cited because of the high standard of its roads but if a person is caught drink driving there, he or she is locked up and there is no messing around for two or three years while he or she seeks out the best lawyer in the state. He or she is prosecuted on the spot.When considering the positive aspect of road traffic policy in other jurisdictions, we should examine how offenders are treated because we are casual or lenient in that regard. If this was happening in other areas of law enforcement there would be a greater outcry, but it is acceptable where motoring offences are concerned, which also raises questions about everyone's priorities. Everybody will recall the difficulties experienced by the Government three weeks ago and the concern among the public about rushing legislation. However, more than 400 people are dying on our roads but nobody is concerned if somebody challenges the use of the breathalyser, speed cameras and so on. As Deputy McEntee highlighted, an individual convicted of an offence one year was able to drive over his own father the following year. That cannot be accepted in modern society.Although delays in bringing the Bill before the House are regrettable, it would be better in the long term to ensure the legislation is far reaching and watertight. However, all Members will do their best to ensure good legislation is passed. Tackling road deaths must involve changing the mindset of young people in particular because they have most to learn, and a partnership approach between drivers and the authorities must be adopted if we are to be successful in halting the carnage. That is a two way process and I will refer to a number of examples of partnership later.People are being killed on roads around the country on a daily basis because they take chances speeding and they lack driving knowledge. Those who drive between Cork and Dublin regularly witness people in the smallest vehicles driving at the highest speeds. They aim the car in one direction and hang on to the steering wheel while hoping for the best, which is tragic. We must get tough on senseless speeding, drunk and reckless driving and ensure conformity to existing provisional licence regulations while they are still in force, and have planned learner driver initiatives implemented. I was glad Gay Byrne stated before the recent bank holiday weekend that he is not concerned about the driver who travels at 3 or 4 mph over the speed limit because we all know what constitutes senseless speeding. The EU may make a stand on driving standards and, hopefully, a positive directive will be introduced on this issue. Tough new deterrents must be considered to ensure a positive change in driving attitudes, which will help educate people that the faster they drive, the greater the possibility of serious injury or even death.Education of all drivers, not simply learner drivers, is an essential priority. Important factors include changes in the road structure and types of roads, at complicated junctions and roundabouts, in higher vehicle speeds and a greater number of heavy goods vehicles. All must continually educate themselves on the dangers of driving in public. Based on my observations, present driving standards are much poorer than in the past. This may be due to the greater number of vehicles and the greater number of people who have been able to acquire a car. However, those who have been driving for a long time and who realise that danger is continual and imminent must allow for that.The introduction of driver theory tests and practical learner instruction to the secondary school curricula, possibly in transition or leaving certificate years, might increase awareness among young drivers. Heretofore, had one suggested that students should be taught to drive properly, people would have scoffed. However, it must be accepted that at present, many students drive and bring their cars to school, and they should be taught the correct way, in so far as possible.At present, it is far too easy to start driving on provisional licences, and many young and inexperienced motorists are not sufficiently well prepared for the potential difficulties which they might experience. The Bill provides for the introduction of a learner permit to replace provisional licences. It is quite possible that the EU will intervene in respect of the provisional licence issue and will prohibit people with such licences from driving unaccompanied, by issuing a directive to that effect.New regulations may require learner drivers to undergo a course of instruction. The content of such courses of instruction may be regulated, as may the amount which driving instructors charge for such courses. This is welcome, as I have always argued that once something like insurance becomes mandatory, there should be an element of State control on the charges levied. I believe the driver instruction charges should be similarly covered.The Bill also suggests a period to be specified following the grant of a learner permit during which a learner driver may not apply for a driving test. This is intended to ensure there will be a minimum period in which a learner driver has to undergo instruction before being allowed to apply for a test. This is common sense. I expect that all Members can remember the first time he or she went out on the road, the terror of trying to steer the car and so on. Moreover, that was when traffic levels were only 50% or less of the present levels. As the roads become more crowded, and it becomes more dangerous to drive, it is essential that people are reasonably trained.As the Minister noted, this Bill represents the sixth major legislative initiative taken in the area of road traffic in the past six years. Penalty points, new speed limits based on metric values and the establishment of the Road Safety Authority have all been introduced. The penalty points system is now being implemented and the public, particularly those who have picked up points, will appreciate their presence fairly shortly. The delay was due to messing about with computers, difficulties with logging on and so forth. However, the amalgamation of the PULSE system with the Garda's new system will mean that people will receive penalty points notices more speedily — no pun intended. In addition, enforcement will take place. In tests conducted four or five years ago, it was found that 50% of the film in fixed speed cameras was clouded. Hopefully, such things will not happen any longer, because they bring everything regarding the control of speeding into disrepute.However, this Bill, correctly emphasises road safety provisions. Members should deal with this aspect, rather than trying to start an inter-party row about finance or other matters. Although serious concern is expressed in this regard, as I noted in the context of the courts, I do not know whether people follow through sufficiently on that concern. Hopefully, they will do so in the future.This legislation is aimed at creating the conditions and consciousness that will lead to a significant reduction in the number of fatalities and serious injuries. This must be restated and the public must react to what has been happening in the courts. Although members of the public might be personally affected by a particular case, they must stand up to be counted and to state that they do not accept some of the things that have happened in respect of traffic offences related to bad driving.Enforcement of the traffic laws and the promotion of driver education are crucial in the effort to cut back on the carnage. At the time when the first road safety strategy was published, it was believed that if the Government could not come up with a planned co-ordination of actions by various bodies, road deaths would reach 550 by 2002. The Minister mentioned that point. While the previous speaker mentioned some figures, the Committee of Public Accounts performed some analysis in so far as it could. Although the committee did not wish to cite a specific figure, a minimum of 100 lives have been saved by the implementation of the penalty points system. The figure was arrived at by considering the number of vehicles on the road at the time of its implementation, as well as the numbers of accidents, fatalities and so on, and working from that basis.Many people and agencies have many ideas on road safety and open and frank debate with collective analysis will facilitate the development of new and better strategies to replace older initiatives.I stated that there must be a partnership approach. For many drivers, inconsistency in the implementation of speed limits is the most annoying aspect of this issue. For instance, an example which irritates me weekly is the Naas Road, which now has seven miles of double carriageway on both sides. Most of it is newly constructed and it has four well-lit and well laid out traffic lanes, which are probably of a higher standard than 80% of roads in the rest of the country. However, that seven mile strip has a speed limit of 60 km/h, whereas on 80% of vastly inferior roads there is a limit of 100 km/h. I understand the National Roads Authority imposed the 60 km/h limit. It is, however, life threatening to drive on that road within the speed limit.Three weeks ago, I had the experience of being passed by the driver of a low-loader, which had a trailer attached, with two traxcavators on board. He drove behind me and became so annoyed that he swerved around me, passed me out and then pulled in sharply in front of me. Perhaps he was teaching me a lesson because I was driving so slowly. It is likely that I was driving seven or eight kilometres per hour over the limit prescribed on the signs. There was nothing in front of me for the next quarter of a mile on a busy Thursday afternoon, because other drivers simply ignored what they regarded as a very unfair limit. It is scandalous and brings matters into disrepute. This is meant to be a partnership and people are entitled to a fair crack of the whip. The retention of that limit on that road for so long amounts to laziness, carelessness or whatever.Moreover, a new sign has been erected, to the effect that the road is Garda controlled. Hence, one is being threatened with penalty points on an excellent seven miles of dual carriageway, without contra-flows or anything similar. I can travel to New Inn in County Tipperary, where the trees hang over the road and the grass grows to its edge, or to Abbeyleix, which is similar, and can drive legally at 100 km/h. I invite the members of the National Roads Authority to drive this excellent stretch of road on a busy afternoon to ascertain whether they can do so while driving within the limit. If they do, they will take their lives in their hands. Hence, common sense is needed on both sides of this issue.As the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, pointed out in his opening remarks, the public and political scrutiny of the first road safety strategy gave rise to the identification of many of the policy options identified in the second strategy, which is now in its final year. The current strategy has seen the implementation of the metric system of speed limits, the roll-out of the penalty points system, the introduction of the Garda national traffic corps and the Road Safety Authority. The advent of these organisations will have a positive effect on road safety in the long term.I must confess that I cannot recall the name of the previous speaker, who is the most recently elected Member. He complained about finance, potholes and the condition of roads. The capital investment programme for the next ten years under Transport 21 is €34.4 billion, which must make a massive improvement. No matter what way one breaks it down, it is an investment of €9.4 million every day for the next ten years. Anyone coming here and suggesting money is not being made available for infrastructural improvements, roads and public transport is being misleading. It does not help in attempting to prevent fatalities.Transport 21 will connect all regions to each other as well as our main sea ports and airports. In cities, including my city of Cork, it will provide greatly enhanced public transport alternatives to the private car. We have new train carriages on the journey to Dublin which provide us with great comfort at €2 million a throw. We do fairly well.I wish the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, every success with this critical Bill. Every one of us is involved in road safety. Those of us who drive have particular involvement but even pedestrians are involved as are our families. I commend the Bill to the House.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. As the Minister stated in his speech, it is the sixth Bill to deal with road traffic and infrastructure generally. I wish to pick up on a couple of issues at the outset.The previous speaker discussed the amount of money to be spent on the roads over the coming years and that it is not the issue. As one who lived a mile and a half from Swann's Cross, where five young people died as a result of a road accident, I highlighted that junction 16 times in writing to the local authority and begged them to take action on it. I thanked the Minister at the time because after the five people were killed we got a roundabout on the junction and, thank God, it is safe now. Think of what could have been done if the money had been provided in time. The designs used by some engineers and the amount of money spent on consultants is unbelievable when one considers the results in places, such as junctions around Carrickmacross and other areas. A major question mark hangs over them.The previous speaker also discussed speed limits. We spent a number of days in this House discussing the change of speed limits from the imperial to the metric system. However, nothing was done in terms of changing the speed limits on roads. If one drives from Slane to Drogheda, every few miles one sees a sign denoting a speed limit of 100 km/h but one cannot even get around the bends. However, on good stretches of road, one is only allowed drive at 80 km/h. One must ask major questions about the common sense used and how it was done.I draw further attention to section 19 where the Minister states he has provided for the extension of powers available to the Garda Síochána to detain uninsured vehicles to vehicles registered in states other than Ireland. This is a major and important issue. Many cars with foreign registrations drive about with blacked-out windows. We do not know who is in them, or whether the driver has a licence or insurance. If we are to take control, the Garda must be given the wherewithal to deal with it properly.This legislation is important. However, while this Government never has a problem introducing legislation, unfortunately its record in providing manpower to deliver its meaning in action is a failure. Many Bills come to mind in that context. One involved a Bill on meat in bonemeal introduced in 1989 but personnel were not put in place to implement it until 1996.I welcome aspects of the Bill regarding mandatory alcohol testing, review of fines, disqualifications regarding drink driving offences and regulations on the use of mobile phones. However, I am concerned about the new framework for the engagement of private sector interests in the provision and operation of cameras and other technology for the detection of speeding offences. I want to see speeding controlled. However, I am concerned it will be done purely to obtain extra funds for private enterprise.I accept that as a result of the Government's failure to provide Garda manpower and its failure to release up to 500 gardaí on desk duty, which could be done by civilians, it is possible the simplest solution is to hire the private sector to manage the cameras. I have no doubt that many like me will be concerned about how the private sector scheme will work. It will obviously be profit driven. It may even pick out the easy and most vulnerable places to establish the cameras, and not necessarily places which would lead to the prevention of accidents and saving lives.The Minister must clarify who will be in charge of these private operators, to what standards and controls they will operate and who will monitor the system to ensure power is not abused. Speeding and drink driving are the main causes of loss of life and accidents on the roads. The best possible deterrent to both of these is the active involvement of the Garda Síochána and the visibility of gardaí at all hours of the night and day in relevant places. It is more important to stop drink driving and fast driven cars than to collect money.I welcome the fact this Bill also deals with the use of mobile phones. All of us who are constantly on the roadways have been guilty in the past of using these communication items. Nothing is as dangerous as the use of such instruments, particularly through busy traffic and nothing annoys me more than to see drivers of extremely big lorries and buses turning corners or going through traffic lights with mobile phones to their ears. Surely, all individuals in cars, lorries or buses should by now have an overhead system to ensure their hands are free to control such lethal weapons.This Government has completely failed to deal with unlicensed drivers. The current Minister, like his predecessor, failed to bring in additional driving testers to minimise delay and give young drivers the opportunity to get their full licences and, consequently, cheaper insurance. This failure has cost the youth of our country millions. Years ago, Deputies Naughten and Coveney prepared regulations which would have helped to solve this issue and provide better educated young drivers. The Government smirked at it. However, a small category also exists of older people who, for whatever reason, still do not have a full licence. They must be dealt with in a common sense way and given a degree of leeway to allow them go to the village shop or place of worship.Initially, the introduction of penalty points reduced the numbers of deaths on our roads for a few months, clearly because of media coverage and Garda visibility. However, without the presence of gardaí neither this nor any other Bill will deliver the goods. It is up to the Government to provide the manpower and resources for the Garda Síochána if this is to be meaningful.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	455	As far as the Road Traffic Bill is concerned, Fine Gael certainly welcomes it. Any right thinking citizen who considers what is involved in this legislation must decide it is for the greater good of the people. I have serious doubts about some aspects of it but this is no reason for us not to want to ensure that legislation of the highest quality is passed. Many arguments will be made and votes called on Committee Stage because certain aspects of the Bill will not stand up legally. I am a member on the Select Committee on Transport and have listened to a range of people over the past 12 months, each with his own speciality. Everybody has a very important objective and we can only hope this Bill and others will be cohesive.For some strange reason, the Government and many outside this House wonder why the carnage is so great on the roads. If ever there were a cancer in society, it is the manner in which people blatantly abdicate their responsibility when behind the wheel during the day and particularly at night. There are now twice as many cars on the road as there were 20 years ago. Not only is this the case but there is also a substantial increase in their horsepower. People boast about the horsepower of their cars. Irrespective of what anybody might say, our road network has not kept pace with the number of motorists thereon. We are simply running out of space.In addition to this, alcoholism has become rampant. I do not have to tell colleagues in this House about the level of binge drinking, particularly among groups of youths, all over the country and at all hours of the night. If one wanted to know the cocktail of circumstances that create havoc on the roads, one should consider all the aforementioned factors. They are certainly a recipe for disaster, which is what we have.We have a culture of admiring those who get away with something. Consider what happens when somebody is let off in court, although I am sure this happens for very good legal reasons. The recent dismissal of drink driving offences in court, for example, serves as oxygen for thousands of people. When they hear about it they get it into their skulls that they, too, can have their cases dismissed. Solicitors and barristers are entitled to exploit loopholes in the law so their clients' cases can be dismissed. However, every time it is broadcast on television that a drink driving case has been dismissed on a technicality, it should be noted that the accused persons were under the influence of alcohol. To this day, a great number of people almost wave the flag and congratulate such people on getting away with their offence. Until this culture changes we will have a serious problem.The culture can be changed in the same way we changed the smoking culture that existed prior to the smoking ban. As Members well know, people actually turn up their noses in all sorts of public places if they see somebody smoking. We will have to turn up our noses at drink driving. Until we do so to the extent that people will not tolerate the existing culture, we will not make any headway.I like a number of provisions in this Bill. I have always believed that nobody should have to wait six to ten months for a driving test. When one is learning to drive, the teachers are in a position to impart to one the right sort of knowledge. Many teachers do so but we do not have national standards. I assume this Bill will address this problem and that we will have certain, specific standards.We introduced a Bill on mobile phones some weeks ago during Private Members' time. The Government said it saw nothing wrong with it but that, because it was initiated by the Opposition, it would await its own Bill. We now have that Bill and it has certain flaws but one does not have to be a rocket scientist to know one cannot possibly have one's mind on the road while at the same time messing around trying to find digits on a mobile phone as one drives down a busy thoroughfare. The day has come on which this practice should be wiped out. I have a hands-free mobile phone and, like most others, I do a great deal of business with it. However, I wonder how safe it is. In any case, it is senseless to drive while using a mobile phone as it affects concentration. I hope that whatever formula of words we include in this Bill will stand up in court and that anybody driving, with a mobile phone in hand while on the road will be regarded as committing an offence. I hope sincerely we will be able to achieve this.Consider that a garda must "form an opinion" on people intending to drive after tumbling out of public houses and other places late at night before he can make an arrest. One can rest assured that the context in which a garda witnesses people coming out of a public house at midnight is very different to that in which he witnesses people coming out from mass 12 hours later. The garda would certainly be more likely to meet intoxicated people in the former case. There is a constitutional matter involved in this regard but it is simple as far as I am concerned. I have been a pioneer all my life but spend a great deal of time in pubs. If, after this Bill is enacted, a garda sees me coming out of a pub at midnight or 12.30 a.m. and tells me he is going to breathalyse me, I will see nothing wrong with it because I will have nothing to hide. One could not say I would be grossly inconvenienced. If the law were such that somebody emerging from a pub after having consumed eight, ten or 12 pints could be stopped from driving as a result, it would be good law.I hope when the Bill is enacted it will be interpreted by the judges in the way we interpret it on the floor of this House. As such, the people will accept it and will not regard it as too great an intrusion into their private lives. I would not regard it as such, nor would many others.I have had a bee in my bonnet all my life about those found guilty of causing death on the road while under the influence of alcohol and therefore not in their full senses. There should be a mandatory jail sentence of a defined length for such people who cause havoc among families.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Power, to the House. The issue I raise is the need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the high incidence of cancer in disadvantaged urban areas. As the Minister of State is aware, Ireland has among the highest cancer incidences and mortality rates in western Europe and in the western world. Each year, approximately 28,000 new cancer cases are diagnosed and 11,000 die from the disease on this island of 5.5 million people.Statistics I recently obtained from the National Cancer Registry clearly demonstrate that the incidence of cancer is higher in Dublin city than in surrounding counties and that there are major differences within Dublin city. Certain areas such as Ballybough, west Cabra, Arran Quay, my own constituency of Dublin Central, Ballymun in Dublin North-West and Merchant's Quay in Dublin South-Central have cancer rates over 50% higher than the national average, or what is called the standardised incidence ratio, SIR. Such a high variation from the norm cannot be due to chance and clearly indicates that there are real and substantially greater cancer risks in certain parts of the city over other parts.A 50% variation from the norm is a very serious matter for the residents of the areas affected. Material deprivation and high smoking levels are suggested by the National Cancer Registry as major factors contributing to higher cancer levels, but it is clear these are not the only factors as other traditionally deprived areas in the city of Dublin have only average rates of cancer. As lung cancer is by far the commonest cause of death from cancer, it is likely that fumes from motor vehicles are a significant factor. However, there may be other local but unknown causes and it is not sufficient for the health authorities simply to speculate about the causes of such a huge variation in the incidence of cancer in the city of Dublin. They must research and determine the causes.I call on the Health Service Executive to conduct an urgent investigation into the five district electoral divisions in Dublin city where the incidence of cancer exceeds the standardised incidence ratio by 50% or more. By way of information for the Minister of State, Ballybough A, the district electoral division, is 150%, which is 50% above the norm. Ballymun C is 1.68%, which is 68% above the norm. That is very high. Cabra west A is 57% above the norm, while Merchant's Quay A at 1.64% is 64% above the norm. Those are very high incidence rates. Other areas are 20%, 30% and 40% but the fact that five separate electoral areas have levels over 50% above the norm is a massive variation.The fact that the city of Dublin has a much higher incidence of cancers than the rest of the country demands that the HSE examine this matter. It is not much use saying we have the statistics and from those we speculate that it may be due to smoking or deprivation. What does that mean? There are many areas in Dublin city where these levels are the norm. They are the norm in the area of the north docks, for example, yet an area like Ballybough is over 56% above the norm, Cabra is 60% above the norm and Ballymun is 60% above the norm. That is very serious statistics. Cancer is one of the biggest killers in this country and we do not know the reason for the clusters of cancer in these inner city areas — Ballybough, Merchant's Quay, Arran Quay, Ballymun and Cabra west.I would be pleased if the Minister of State accepted my proposal that the Health Service Executive should conduct an urgent investigation into these clusters of cancer in the city of Dublin.

I am happy to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.Just over a week ago the Tánaiste launched A Strategy for Cancer Control in Ireland 2006, which was prepared by the National Cancer Forum. The forum expects that, mainly for demographic reasons, the number of patients with cancer will double over the next 15 years. One of the most significant strategic issues facing cancer services is the variation in survival rates within Ireland and our relatively poorer cancer survival rates for many common cancers when compared with other European countries. In part, this can be attributed to the fragmentation of cancer services, whereby too many hospitals are involved in the provision of treatment for cancer.The strategy makes recommendations in relation to organisation, governance, quality assurance and accreditation across the continuum of cancer care from health promotion, prevention and screening through to treatment services, supportive and palliative care and research. There is a strong emphasis in the strategy on health promotion,addressing inequalitiesand quality assurance. Cancer patients should receive multi-disciplinary care from cancer specialists in radiology, pathology, surgery, medical and radiation oncology and oncology nursing, all working together as an integrated team.Since the implementation of the first national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, approximately €920 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. These screening and treatment services are available free at point of service subject to the basic public charges and are provided on a whole-population basis. A total of 34,000 more people were treated for cancer in public hospitals in 2004 compared to 1998, an increase of 60%. The Vote for the Health Service Executive in 2006 includes a sum of €9 million to continue to meet the additional service pressures in cancer care, improve the quality of care, facilitate better access to radiation oncology services and continue the preparation for the national cervical screening programme.While cancer services have improved, the prevention and reduction of incidences of this disease has become a priority. Current research suggests that approximately 30% of cancer deaths are potentially avoidable by the modification of diet, making diet second only to tobacco as a preventable cause of cancer. Disadvantage and poor lifestyle habits are often linked and it is acknowledged that those in the lower socio-economic groups are more likely to develop diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer than their more affluent and educated counterparts. These health inequalities must be addressed or the burden of care which will be required will be enormous. Through modifying lifestyle behaviours in the population, significant gains will be made both for the individual in that they will achieve a better quality of life and for the health services through substantial savings in future health care costs.The Department of Health and Children conducted a review of the impact of the National Health Promotion Strategy 2000-2005. It found that high levels of implementation at both national and regional level were reported in regard to being smoke free, being more active and eating well.Tobacco use is the single largest causative factor, accounting for 30% of all cancer deaths in developed countries. Many advances have been made with regard to smoking and smoking control in Ireland in recent years, including a ban on advertising. However, on 29 March 2004 the workplace ban on smoking was introduced in all places of work, including licensed premises. With a 94% compliance rate and a reduction in smoking rates, the health benefits of this legislation will become apparent in the future.For more than 11 years the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children co-ordinated an annual healthy eating campaign, which aimed to promote awareness of specific healthy eating messages and to provide practical information to the general public. These campaigns have enhanced public awareness on healthy eating guidelines on fruit and vegetables, fibre, low fat and being a healthy weight.The World Health Organisation states that regular physical activity is a significant element in cancer prevention and control. There is consistent evidence that some form of regular physical activity is associated with a reduction in the risk of colon cancer. The protective effect of physical activity on cancer risk improves with increasing levels of activity. Twelve physical activity co-ordinators have been appointed in the HSE and structures have been put in place to provide advice and support in a number of settings including schools, workplaces and communities, targeting in particular the young and older people.The reorganisation of the Department of Health and Children and the devolvement of executive functions to the Health Service Executive present an opportunity to address, in a more fundamental way, the broader determinants of health, such as lack of education or low socio-economic status, and to reduce health inequalities. There now needs to be sustained focus on the wider social and economic determinants of health to move beyond the lifestyle risk factors. This will require collaboration and collective action across Departments in association with the private sector and other statutory and non-statutory agencies. This Government will not be found wanting in continuing to improve the health status of the population and in particular those who are most vulnerable.

In the course of his judgment, the judge criticised Wicklow County Council for not being forthcoming with information about the issue and the resultant confusion led to the dismissal of the cases. A number of issues need to be considered.Wicklow County Council was not a party or notice party to the case, and it had furnished the relevant information on request to the Garda. The relevant speed limits were correctly adopted by the council and this procedure was outlined in a submission, prior to the judgment. With over 180 road fatalities this year, it is unacceptable that a possible lack of co-ordination between the Garda and the local authority may have led to the dismissal of these cases. If a course of appeal is available I hope the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda will avail of it. It is important that I briefly outline the sequence of events.On 1 March 2000, as part of a countywide review of speed limits by the local authority, a speed limit of 40 mph was set at Kilmacanogue on the N11. In September 2000, the 40 mph speed limit was extended a couple of miles south of Kilmacanogue to an area known as Barry's Bridge, to facilitate work at the Glen of the Downs. On 19 April 2004, following completion of those works, the 40 mph speed limit was redefined in the Kilmacanogue village area. A 50 mph limit was set for the rest of the area south of this through to the southern end of the Glen of the Downs. On 4 October 2004, following numerous representations, an area south of Kilmacanogue to the north of the Glen of the Downs was made a 60 mph zone, while the Glen of the Downs remained at 50 mph. That detail might seem somewhat confusing, but it is important to emphasise that all of that was passed by proper resolution by the members of Wicklow County Council.In November 2005, at the request of a solicitor defending a client who was being prosecuted for speeding, two certificates were issued by Wicklow County Council, one certifying an extract of the minutes of 19 April 2004 and the other certifying an extract of the meeting of 4 October 2004. The certificates issued, signed by an official of Wicklow County Council, stated that these extracts were true and correct copies taken from the minutes of the relevant council meetings at which the speed limits were adopted. During the course of his defence, a solicitor argued with respect to the offences prosecuted that the certificates issued on 14 November 2005 had the same date as that on which the special limits were adopted. This was not the situation. I want to find out why Wicklow County Council was not a party or notice party to this case, why the Garda was not briefed by the local authority, whose fault it was and whether there will be an appeal process.It is totally unacceptable, given the number of road deaths and the airing of road traffic issues every day of the week that so many people who should have faced prosecution have slipped through the net.
#MildredFox	unknown-#MildredFox-party	unknown-#MildredFox-dob	unknown-#MildredFox-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I thank Deputy Timmins for sharing time.I am also surprised at the criticism being levelled at Wicklow County Council as a result of this decision. Wicklow Country Council was not a notice party in these proceedings. Had its representatives been present to clarify matters, it would have saved much time, money and confusion.The speed limit in Kilmacanogue has not changed since March 2000 when it was set at 40 mph or 60 kph. The same speed limit is still legally in force today. Luckily, from a safety viewpoint, the area in question is a newly constructed dual carriageway and not a more dangerous secondary road. The number of cases which were thrown out is an indication of how well policed that particular stretch of road in Kilmacanogue is. It is one of the most heavily policed stretches of road in the country — and I am only sorry that I was so quick to pay my own fine in that area.The biggest scandal this case highlights is the fact that gardaí spend so much time on safe stretches of road, on which we have spent millions to make safer. It is very easy to catch soft targets doing 70 kph on a 60 kph stretch of road. It is not so easy to pay attention to secondary roads at 3 a.m. on a Saturday morning, where our young people are dying. Penalty points are only effective when properly enforced, which is not the case. That is why the system has no impact. We are told that speed kills, which is true. Signs remind us how many people have been killed. We see the gruesome advertisements on television, and still young people die every weekend on our roads. The message is lost on us.There has to be greater communication between local authorities and the Garda in cases such as this, where confusion arises. Local authority staff should be given the opportunity to give evidence and save time and embarrassment and to assist the Garda as much as possible.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I thank Deputies Timmins and Fox for raising this matter. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who unfortunately is unable to be present. I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I are aware of developments in this matter.The Minister has been informed that a number of cases involving motorists who had been charged with breaking a 60 kph speed restriction on the N11 dual carriageway at the village of Kilmacanogue were dismissed at Bray District Court on Friday, 16 June 2006. The cases involved the issue of the legality of the speed limit. It was argued on behalf of the defence that there had been significant delay between the adoption of a special speed limit and its ratification by a vote of the elected members of Wicklow County Council. The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that a representative of Wicklow County Council was present in Bray District Court on 2 June and gave evidence. A representative from Wicklow County Council was not required for the 16 June sitting, as the judge was to come to his decision in relation to the cases at that sitting.Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004, operative since 20 January 2005, provides the legislative basis for the application of special speed limits. The purpose of special speed limits is to allow the major local authorities — the county and city councils — to replace the default or standard speed limits that would otherwise apply to roads. The making of special speed limit by-laws, to apply a special speed limit in lieu of a default speed limit, is a matter for each individual county council or city council. Section 9(12) establishes that a copy of by-laws made under the section can be used as evidence of the fact stated in the by-law in court proceedings.Local authorities have had the power since the passing of the Road Traffic Act 1994 to make special speed limit by-laws. Furthermore, section 12(1) of the 2004 Act provides that speed limit by-laws made in advance of the coming into operation of section 9 continue in place but are to be read as applying metric equivalents to the speed limits to which they refer. In other words, it provides for the automatic conversion of the units of measurement from miles per hour to kilometres per hour in respect of any special speed limits that were applied under by-laws made prior to 20 January 2005, the date on which the 2004 Act became operative. By-laws in place on that date remain in force until such time as new by-laws are made by the city or county council under section 9 of the 2004 Act.From enquiries made I am informed that the special speed limit by-laws in place prior to 20 January 2005 are still applicable across all 34 local authority areas and that five of the local authorities have adopted additional special speed limits. I understand that the majority of the councils either have a review of existing speed limits under way or are planning such a review later this year.A new policy element was introduced under section 10 of the 2004 Act to enable a county manager or a city manger to make a road works speed limit order to apply a road works speed limit for a limited period. This power has been and is being exercised at road works in various areas.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been informed by the Garda authorities that where a person is issued with a fixed charge notice for a penalty point offence, the notice sets out the amount of the fixed charge and the penalty points applicable to the offence. The person has an option to pay the fixed charge and, as part of the payment process, completes a declaration that he or she is aware of the contents of the notice. When a payment is made, the Garda notifies the Minister for Transport who is responsible for the endorsement of penalty points on the entry in the licence record of the person. If the person named in the notice opts not to pay the fixed charge, then a prosecution is taken and if a person is convicted the Courts Service is responsible for notifying the Minister for Transport, as in all cases the decision of the District Court may be appealed.An individual who receives penalty points may write to the Garda national processing office at 89-94 Capel Street, Dublin 1, requesting the removal of penalty points in circumstances such as when the alleged offence had no legal status. The Department of Transport, on the written request of a chief superintendent, may remove penalty points from a driving licence in such circumstances.As the matter of the cases before Bray District Court is still under consideration by the courts, the Minister is not in a position to comment further at this time.

Students, parents and the principal of Gaelscoil Sairséal are so desperate to ensure that there is definite progress in the acquisition of a site for their school before the summer break that they took the extreme measure of protesting outside the Dáil earlier today. I am sure many Members will have seen the children there. That is an indication of the situation in Gaelscoil Sairséal.Gaelscoil Sairséal is a wonderful school with a dedicated and enlightened principal, staff, board of management and parents who involve themselves fully in the life of the school. However, they operate in atrocious conditions. The main school building was built as a courthouse 240 years ago and has dark, damp, leaking overcrowded classrooms and a tiny school yard. It was declared unsuitable for health and safety reasons for a different school many years ago. The infant classrooms are in St. Mary's Band Hall, which has no playground and which is entirely inappropriate for use as a school, particularly for small children. There is no natural light in some of the classrooms and ventilation and heating are sub-standard. I have visited the school on a number of occasions and have seen the conditions first hand. I have also witnessed the dedication of the staff and parents to that school. It is hard to believe that the Department of Education and Children has not treated their needs as an emergency. Parents in the school have said that if they kept their children in those conditions at home, the children would probably be taken into care.Gaelscoil Sairséal has been in temporary accommodation for 16 years, the last 12 in the current two sites. They thought a permanent site was secured in February 2001 when the board was informed by the Office of Public Works that a deal had been made with a developer to purchase a site. However, this site was lost because funds were not released in time to finalise the purchase. Parents, children and teachers were told they would have to wait again. There is now another opportunity. There are three acres of land, zoned for educational and community use, available on the outskirts of Limerick city. The school submitted an application relating to this land in January 2005. It has not yet been acquired by the OPW. I have raised this matter on a number of occasions through parliamentary questions. I have been told the OPW is aware of the site and is dealing with the developer, but issues remain to be clarified.The real fear among the parents, teachers and children at the school is that this site might fall through their hands. They have taken the extreme step of coming to the Dáil to make their protest. They are determined to purchase the site for their school and that this will happen before the summer break. I hope the Minister of State can give me an answer that will ensure is the case.Any further delay is inexcusable. The children simply cannot be left in these conditions. I call on the Minister for Education and Science to sanction the purchase of the site and to provide the funding to build the school without any further delay.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I thank the Deputy for affording me the opportunity to outline to this House the proposals of the Department of Education and Science regarding the need to acquire a permanent site for Gaelscoil Sairséal in Limerick. I also apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, who is unable to be here this evening.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum. As evidence of this commitment, approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects will take place in our primary and post-primary schools during 2006. Over €500 million is being spent on primary and post-primary projects throughout the country. This unprecedented level of capital investment is testament to the importance the Government places on improving the quality of accommodation in our schools.This school originated on the north side of Limerick city but had to relocate to the city centre due to accommodation issues. The majority of pupils come from the north side of the city. It is the responsibility of the board of management to secure interim accommodation until such time as the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation. The school is currently split between two sites. The main building is on Bridge Street. The ground floor contains three classrooms and the first floor contains three classrooms. The basement contains a staffroom, special tuition room and principal's office. First to sixth classes are located in these premises. The infant classes are based at the other site on St. Mary's Street. The Department of Education and Science currently grant-aids 95% of the rental cost of these premises at a total of £147,000 per annum. The school's contribution to the rental cost is capped at €3,175 per annum.The school is awaiting the provision of a permanent building. Its priority rating is band two. Architectural planning cannot commence until a suitable site is secured. The property management section of the Office of Public Works has been requested by the Department of Education and Science to source a site for the Gaelscoil. While a suitable parcel of land has been identified, a map of the specific area offered to the Department for sale is awaited from the landowner. This map is required in order to clarify specific suitability issues such as topography, access, availability of services and so on. As soon as the OPW receives this map, these more detailed issues can be examined. When a suitable site has been secured, the proposed building project for Gaelscoil Sairséal will be considered for progression in the context of the school building and modernisation programme for 2006-10.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which allows me to outline the progress being made to acquire a permanent site for Gaelscoil Sairséal in Limerick.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter.Catherine was a perfect child until she got encephalitis at the age of three. Her balance went and she developed a juvenile form of multiple sclerosis. She is now 22 years old and is in need of full-time care and assistance for all the tasks of everyday life. She suffers from epilepsy and kidney problems, with urinary incontinence. She has tunnel vision and lacks peripheral vision. She needs to use a wheelchair to get out and about.Catherine attends the training centre in Ballina, County Mayo, two days per week. She has a personal assistant with her in the centre who protects her from falls and looks after her every personal need. Without the presence of this personal assistant on those two days, she would not be safe and would be a danger to herself. She would like to spend more than two days at the centre, but this is not possible because of a lack of funding to hire a personal assistant for the other three days. She must stay a home because of this.I appeal for funding for the hiring of her personal assistant for the other three weekdays as she is restless and ill at ease sitting at home. Like everyone else, she wants to work five days of the week. She is demoralised when she cannot work as she misses the social contact with her fellow workers. She is not happy because she must stay at home. She must do so only because money is not available to hire her personal assistant for the other three days a week and, unlike her work colleagues, she cannot work those days. She was also refused respite care and her mother was refused a carer's allowance.I appeal to the Minister of State to act to provide the necessary funding for the hiring of Catherine's personal assistant to enable her to work for five days a week. I cannot understand how that cannot be done — in the interests of equality it should be done. Disability is something with which this girl must live for the rest of her life. She would have a better chance of a normal life and an existence in which she could contribute even more to society like everyone else if she were in a position to work five days a week. It is not fair that she cannot do so and I hope the Minister of State will give her that chance.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify the matter relating to the provision of health related services to people with physical or sensory disabilities, including the provision of personal assistance services.Under the multi-annual investment programme 2006-2009, which is part of the national disability strategy, additional funding amounting to €51.5 million is being provided by the Government in 2006 to meet costs associated with the provision of certain specific high profile disability services. In regard to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism, this includes 255 new residential places; 85 new respite places; 535 new day places; 250,000 extra hours of home support and personal assistance services; and the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability-autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.In addition to these initiatives, additional funding of €22.5 million is being provided this year. This funding has been allocated to enhance the multi-disciplinary support services for children and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and those with autism. The funding will also address core under-funding and core staffing issues in services for people with disabilities provided by the voluntary sector. Capital funding amounting to €45 million has also been provided in 2006 to put in place the infrastructural supports associated with these developments.The provision of personal assistant services by or through the Health Service Executive is based on a careful prioritisation process. This process takes place at local level and draws on the expertise of those active in the voluntary and statutory service. I understand that it also takes account of priorities based on assessment of need.The development of personal assistant services over the last number of years has led to increased demand for the service and the prioritisation process allows for an equitable division of resources. In the case raised by the Deputy, I understand that the Health Service Executive has taken measures to address the service needs of Catherine. I understand that a local voluntary agency has been contracted to provide a personal assistant service to her for two days a week and this arrangement will continue in the future. I have no doubt that the Health Service Executive will continue to keep Catherine's circumstances under review having regard to the prioritisation process for personal assistant services.I note that the Deputy refers to Catherine's wish to work outside the home. I understand that FÁS is active in providing people with disabilities with assistance in gaining and retaining employment and it may be in the best position to assist Catherine in achieving her desire to work.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I welcome the publication by the Combat Poverty Agency (CPA) of its new report "The Distributional Impact of Ireland's Indirect Tax System" and the associated policy statement "Promoting Equity in Ireland's Tax System". The focus of the report is on whether and to what extent the Irish system of indirect taxation, namely VAT and excise duties, is regressive.The report outlines that over the period 2000 to 2005, the share of total Current Exchequer Revenues represented by VAT and excises duties combined has remained unchanged at 44.5%. The authors concluded that the indirect tax system appears to be regressive in the sense that households in the lowest decile pay a higher proportion of their income in indirect taxes relative to households in the higher deciles.However, they also noted that—the indirect tax system includes some elements of progressivity such as low tax rates on food and fuel and zero tax rates on children's clothes and footwear, and—that changes to some other elements could have negative effects elsewhere. For example, lowering taxes on drink and tobacco would have negative health effects.In conclusion, the authors do not recommend adjustments to indirect taxes.This Government remains committed to improving the standard of living of welfare dependent and low-income households. Since 1997, the lowest rates of welfare payments have increased by almost 100%, well ahead of the 49% accumulated inflation over that period. In the last Budget, the personal and qualified adult rates of payment were increased by unprecedented amounts. The lowest rates of social welfare payments, were increased by EUR17 per week to EUR165.80, or by 11.4%. This increase is well ahead of projected inflation for 2006 and, therefore, improves and enhances the living standards of all recipients.The report also highlights the need to make work pay for low earners. This has been an important focus of Government policy and I introduced a number of important packages designed to address poverty and to reward work and enterprise in Budget 2006. These included a Child and Family Poverty package of nearly €155 million which involved major improvements for low-income families and for single parent families.I also introduced a wide-ranging employment package of €28 million. This contained a range of measures which will alleviate poverty and support activation by improving income disregards and tapers for people with disabilities, the unemployed and qualified adults. These arrangements maximise the benefits of work for low-income households.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 54 together.The major discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents" which I launched in March this year, addresses the social exclusion and risk of poverty faced by many such families and their children. The report puts forward proposals for reform of the income support system for all parents on a low income. The report proposes the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new parental allowance for low income families with young children.The current one-parent family payment provides long term income support, until children are 18 or 22 if in full-time education, to those parenting alone, with no requirement to be available for or seeking employment. Such long term welfare dependency in respect of a person of working age is not considered to be in the best interests of the lone parent, their children or society in general. Numerous reports have indicated that employment is one of the most important routes out of poverty.Under the proposed parental allowance, it is suggested that an element of conditionality be attached to receipt of the payment. Overall the report proposes that payment of parental allowance should cease when the youngest child reaches the end of their 7th year. This being the case, formal activation would commence when the child was age 5. This would give the parent the opportunity and supports required to engage in education or training for three years, before payment of parental allowance would cease.There is no proposal in the Report to introduce a part-time unemployment payment. However, the Report also considered that the requirement to seek full-time work, which is inherent in the unemployment schemes of my Department, no longer reflects the atypical working patterns of many people in Ireland today, particularly women. The Report proposed that, in order to meet the ‘genuinely seeking work condition' attached to the payment of Unemployment Assistance, seeking work of 19 hours and over should be sufficient. This is in line with the conditions applying to the Family Income Supplement. It is acknowledged that using a benchmark of 19 hours may have implications for other schemes and this will need to be explored further.Activation, as referred to in the proposal, is ‘positive' in nature; it encompasses interview/advice meetings, education and training and providing people with the skills to enable them to achieve financial independence and therefore, a better life for themselves and their children. While conditions are being suggested for receipt of payment, it is proposed that supports will be offered in a structured and systematic manner to the persons concerned. It is only in this context that continuing payment would be made conditional on engagement.I would stress that the discussion paper acknowledges that the age to which the parental allowance should remain payable is a matter for decision by Government following the consultation process currently underway. I have listened carefully to the comments made by organisations representing lone parents at the recent consultation forum which I hosted and have asked them to submit their views and concerns in writing. I have also briefed the Oireachtas Committee on Social Affairs and debated the issue in the Seanad. I will take all of these views into account to arrive at the best possible solution for all.I have asked the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations of the discussion paper, including those related to childcare, education, training and activation measures and work on this has already commenced in consultation with the Departments and agencies concerned. Issues including the possible impact of the proposals on age related poverty traps, will be taken into account in the implementation of the proposals. I will listen closely to the views expressed and will give very serious consideration to them.As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are fully workable and equitable, it will be my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in the course of this year.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 81 together.The Back to Education Allowance or BTEA is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. In 2002 the Government in view of the expenditure constraints facing it at that time, appointed an independent Estimates Review Committee to consider the Estimates proposals received in the Department of Finance from Departments and Offices.In its report to Government, that Committee recommended discontinuation of the practice of paying the Back to Education Allowance over the summer period to people who were formerly on the live register. The Government decided to implement that recommendation, commencing summer 2003. The decision applied only to BTEA participants who were in receipt of an unemployment payment prior to participation in the scheme.It is estimated that in 2002/2003 the total number affected by the decision to discontinue payment for the summer period was 432. The numbers affected decreased to 324 in 2003/2004 and further decreased to 156 in the 2004/2005 academic year. The number of cases affected by the decision to discontinue payment of BTEA during the current summer vacation period is not available at present.In 2004, five people who were participants on the scheme at the time the change was introduced, sought a judicial review. Other participants were subsequently attached to the proceedings, bringing a total of 173 persons. The hearing took place on 7 February 2006 and judgement was delivered on 28 February 2006. The judgment found in favour of one individual but did not find in favour of any of the other people attached to the proceedings. The court decided that restitution was due only in respect of the summer vacation period in 2003 and only in the case of the one individual whose action was successful. My Department is currently making the necessary arrangements in relation to the person concerned.My Department conducted an expenditure review of the BTEA Scheme under the Expenditure Review Initiative which was published in September 2005. Amongst the recommendations of the review was that the position regarding summer payments be monitored but it did not recommend that the payments should be reinstated. I have no plans to make any changes to the summer arrangements for the BTEA Scheme at this time.

In response to this situation, the Government has introduced new rental assistance arrangements giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis. When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the new rental accommodation scheme.The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that, at the beginning of June 2006, over 1,200 tenants have been accommodated under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, with a further 770 accommodated in local authority housing. This is the first step towards having the new arrangements fully operational nationwide by September 2008. These arrangements are intended to be a long-term housing option for the people concerned.In order to finance this initiative €19 million was transferred from my Department's Vote to the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Vote in 2005 and a further €19 million has been transferred for 2006. Similar arrangements will apply in successive years as the new arrangements are fully implemented.The new rental assistance arrangements provide an imaginative additional approach in supporting people with longer-term housing needs. By definition, people on rent supplement for extended durations have a long-term housing need that they cannot otherwise meet, and many of them are on local authority housing lists. The new scheme, particularly the rental accommodation component, will reduce housing waiting lists by providing a useful additional mechanism for providing social housing, alongside more traditional social housing construction programmes and the expansion of the voluntary housing sector.At the end of 2005, 60,176 households were in receipt of assistance under the rent supplement scheme. Over half of these, almost 33,000 tenants, have been on the scheme for 18 months or more. My Department and the Health Service Executive are actively assisting the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in implementing the new arrangements. While the progress in terms of tenants transferring has been somewhat slow initially, I am satisfied that the long standing difficulties faced by long-term private sector tenants are being tackled and all of the relevant agencies are co-operating actively to make the new system work successfully.In recent weeks I have mentioned the concept of some form of housing supplement as a possible alternative to rent supplementation. I am conscious that the rent supplement scheme has become a form of social housing in its own right and for this reason, I am anxious that all avenues are explored to provide financial support for any people on long-term rent supplementation who may be in a position to purchase their own home. In this regard my Department and the Department of Environment Heritage and Local Government, are together overseeing a study which will examine possible approaches to housing. I have asked that the study be undertaken as a matter of urgency and I expect to have a report in the Autumn.

The basis for the restriction contained in the rules is the applicant's habitual residence. The effect is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not paid certain social welfare payments on arrival in Ireland. The question of what is a person's "habitual residence" is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law, which sets out the grounds for assessing individual claims.Each case received for a determination on the habitual residence condition is dealt with in its own right and a decision is based on application of guidelines to the particular individual circumstances of each case. Any applicant who disagrees with the decision of a Deciding Officer has the right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.The operation of the habitual residence condition has been monitored constantly by my Department since its introduction. A comprehensive review of the operation of the condition is currently being complied with a view to:—assessing its impact on different categories of persons claiming Social Assistance/ Child Benefit and Supplementary Welfare Allowance payments;—assessing the current organisational arrangements in the Department for administering the condition and the service provided to customers;—identifying opportunities for improvements to the administration of the scheme, including those aspects involving other Departments;—examining all aspects of the decision making process; and—identifying emerging policy issues and considering how these should be addressed.The review is expected to be completed during the summer. Account is being taken of the views received from various groups and organisations which have an interest in the area. My Department and the Department of the Environment are fully aware of the concerns expressed by the Homeless Agency and other organisations concerning the impact of the new condition in relation to access to homeless services and these are being assessed and monitored as part of the review.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	471	The recently published study referred to reviews the levels and duration of maternity benefits across Europe and shows wide variations. The headline results which state that Ireland has one of the lowest levels of statutory maternity pay in Western Europe, however, warrants closer examination. The study does not take into account the net value of the payment received by the woman during her maternity leave, nor highlight who bears the cost of the benefit payment, nor does it bring out the statutory entitlement to longer, paid absences from employment for maternity purposes.The study shows that, while women in a number of countries receive a higher rate of maternity benefit than those in Ireland, the payment in Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom is liable to both tax and social insurance contributions which will reduce the sum actually received by the woman. In Germany, Hungary, Italy and Sweden the payment received is liable to either tax or to social insurance contributions. Given the higher levels of tax and social insurance contributions that are generally paid by workers in these countries, the real value of maternity benefit paid to mothers is significantly diminished.The survey pointed to the large variances in the number of weeks of paid maternity leave. As recently as March of this year, the duration of paid maternity leave was increased to 22 weeks as a result of Budget 2006, with plans in place to increase the period of statutory paid leave by a further 4 weeks in 2007 — bringing the duration of entitlement to maternity benefit to 26 weeks in total. By comparison Hungary provides 24 weeks; France, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain allow 16 weeks leave and Germany provides for 14 weeks maternity leave.Other differences worth drawing out relate to the mechanisms for delivering the payment and the stability in the payment rate of the period of leave. In this country, the payment of cash benefits during statutory leave is funded from the social insurance fund. In some other countries, such as for example Denmark and the United Kingdom, these costs are transferred to the employer in the first instance, thus reducing the costs to the State. The survey also shows that maternity benefit is paid in a number of countries at a reducing rate over the period of maternity leave. In Ireland, however, the payment rate remains constant during the entire period of 22 weeks, thus ensuring continuity and stability in income over the period.Maternity benefit has been increased significantly over the past five years in terms of both duration and the amount payable. In 2000, the rate payable was the equivalent of EUR219.41 per week over 14 weeks, or EUR3,071 for the duration. Maternity Benefit is now paid at a rate EUR265.60 over 22 weeks or EUR5,843 for the duration. This represents an increase of 90 per cent over a period wherein average industrial earnings increased by just 67 per cent. Further improvement in the duration of maternity benefit payments are planned for 2007.Funding for maternity benefit comes from the social insurance fund, which is in turn financed through contributions paid by employers, employees and the self-employed. Social insurance contributions are generally payable by employees here at 4% and by employers at 10.05%, with further provision for reduced rates of contributions where workers are on low incomes. By comparison, employees pay 18.75% and employers 17-20% in Poland and in Spain, employees pay 4.7%, while their employers pay 23.6%, thus significantly increasing the fund available to meet the cost of maternity payments.In the light of the analysis above, I am satisfied that the rates and duration of maternity benefit in Ireland represent a reasonable response to the income needs of women on maternity leave and can be favourably compared internationally. Further improvements in the maternity benefit scheme will continue to be examined in the context of the wider fiscal and social insurance environment.

I will provide the deputy with a tabular statement that sets out those performance targets and the actual performance achieved for the month of April. These targets refer only to new and repeat claims and do not reflect the significant amount of work involved in dealing with changes to current claims e.g. to amend entitlement where a person's circumstances have changed. Specific targets are not set in respect of appeals but the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office has as an objective in processing appeals as quickly and expeditiously as possible.In 2005 decisions were given in respect of some 2 million new or repeat claims. In addition some 14,000 appeals are dealt with by the Social Welfare Appeals Office on an annual basis. The time taken to process a claim is measured by calculating the elapsed time from the date the claim is made until the date of decision. However, no account is taken of the many factors outside my Department's control which can impinge on the time it takes to make a decision e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers, other third parties or the provision of medical reports.The report for the month of April shows that the relevant targets were met or exceeded in 10 out of 27 areas during the month. The year to date performance shows an improvement over 2005 in 14 out of the 27 areas. I should point out that the Easter holiday period affected the performance figures for the month of April.My Department is committed to ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions that apply. These conditions vary from scheme to scheme and may include establishment of a customer's social insurance record, the provision of medical evidence, verification of identity, satisfying residency conditions and an assessment of means where appropriate.In the past few years my Department has coped with increasing demands arising from significant changes to the social welfare code and in the numbers of persons accessing the system. While these factors have impinged on the ability to achieve the targets set, continuous efforts are made to improve the turnaround times for processing claims. Against a background of increased workloads and scheme complexities, my Department undertook a number of initiatives designed to improve customer service. The most significant of these is its service delivery modernisation (SDM) project which was recently put in place for retirement and contributory old age pension schemes. The project involves radical business, organisational and IT changes to the way these pension schemes are administered. A number of manual procedures and calculations have been automated so as to improve timeliness, accuracy and efficiency. The IT system will also have the facility to automatically generate and issue communications to the customer thus providing an improved level of information. Business procedures are being revised and the organisation of work is being restructured to maximise the benefits of the new IT System.My Department is also developing enhanced management reporting systems as part of its Management Information Framework project. These reporting systems will provide detailed management information that will facilitate improved resource allocation and thus a better response to customer needs.Apart from these developments, there is continued emphasis on providing staff with the necessary training and development so as to ensure they have the required knowledge and skills to carry out their work. I am conscious of the need to provide a quality service to our customers and, with my officials, I am working towards ensuring that my Department continues to deliver a first class service.

They have met with their counterparts in FÁS in that context on eight occasions in the past year. Discussions took place at recent meetings on the Government discussion paper "Supporting Lone Parents" and proposed activation and support measures in this area.In addition regional and local meetings take place between officials from my Department and their regional and local counterparts in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between my Department and FÁS. Issues concerning Lone Parents were also discussed at these meetings.Furthermore, FÁS was represented at the consultation forum on lone parents which I held with representative groups and State Agencies in Farmleigh on 27 April 2006 following the publication of the Government Discussion Paper. I am aware that FÁS was also represented at a number of meetings of the Working Group set up under the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to progress the work in this area.A review of the National Employment Action Plan was completed in November 2005 by Indecon International Consultants for my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and FÁS. One of the recommendations is that the NEAP continue as an effective labour market measure and that consideration be given to extending it to other groups such as lone parents. The recommendations of the Indecon Report are under consideration by my Department and FÁS at present.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 60, 118 and 128 together.I recently launched the Combat Poverty Agency study on the dynamics of child poverty. The study's key findings are that children tend to move in and out of poverty and that child poverty, and its duration, are affected by a wide range of factors, including the employment, education and health status of parents, and by the number and age of children in the household. The report accordingly recommends that the policy response to child poverty should be multi-dimensional in nature, focusing on income supports, combined with measures that support employment, education and accessibility of services such as childcare and health.This Government does have a strategic process in place for combating poverty, including child poverty, in the form of the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion (NAP/inclusion) and the National Children's Strategy. "Ending Child Poverty" was also one of ten special initiatives under the social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. While these elements remain under active progression, I fully expect that the successor to Sustaining Progress and the next NAP/inclusion 2006-2008 will add further impetus to the process. The Agency's latest report will contribute to policy development in this area.It is estimated that some 65,000 children remain in consistent poverty, and moving these children out of poverty remains my priority. I hope in this regard to build on the good progress we have made so far. Some 100,000 children have been lifted out of deprivation inside the last decade as a result of targeted measures and supports. The most significant measure my own Department has taken in recent years to support families with children has been the very substantial real increases in child benefit rates. Between 1997 and 2006, the rate of child benefit rose from EUR38.09 per month for the first two children and EUR49.52 for each child thereafter to EUR150.00 per month for each of the first two children and to EUR185.00 per month for the third and each subsequent child. Child benefit is paid to over half a million families in respect of approximately 1.1 million children at a cost in 2006 of more than EUR2 billion.Child dependent allowances are also paid each week in respect of some 349,000 children. The National Economic and Social Council (NESC) has been examining how these allowances could be incorporated into a new second tier of financial supports, in addition to child benefit and other entitlements, aimed specifically at helping those children most in need. I expect to shortly receive specific proposals from the Council in this regard.I have also made substantial improvements to the family income supplement which assists families at work on low pay. Assessment of entitlement to payment is now on the basis of net rather than gross income, while increases in the income limits have made it easier for lower-income households to qualify under the scheme. My Department also undertook a very successful nationwide awareness campaign last March to promote and encourage take up of the scheme.Additional to the above improvements, Budget 2006 contained a range of measures aimed at families with children, which resulted in part from the work of an inter-departmental working group on early child care and education, chaired by the National Children's Office. More than 350,000 children under 6 years of age, in 250,000 families, will qualify for the new annual EUR1,000 early childcare supplement which will be paid on an agency basis by my Department. The cost of the supplement will be approximately EUR360 million in a full year.Targeted early childhood education provision is a key element of the School Support Programme (SSP), under the new action plan for educational inclusion DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage. The objective in relation to early childhood education is to concentrate actions initially on those children aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 180 urban/town primary schools serving the most disadvantaged communities. The Department of Education and Science is working in partnership with my department and other departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing childcare programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring that the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated manner.One of the key tasks in the "Ending Child Poverty" initiative under Sustaining Progress was to address obstacles to employment for lone parents, whose children are among those most at risk of poverty. Arising from work done in this area by the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion and a working group chaired by my Department, I launched in March of this year a major Government discussion paper, "Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents". The report puts forward radical proposals for reform of the income support system for all parents on a low income. It proposes an expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan; focused provision of childcare; improved information services and the introduction of a new Parental Allowance for low income families with young children. These proposals are currently the subject of an extensive consultation process and I expect to bring proposals for legislation in the course of this year. Preparation of an implementation plan regarding the non-income recommendations of the discussion paper is in progress.The establishment of the Office of the Minister for Children under the Minister for Children represents a major re-organisation of policy and services for children and brings together the areas of child welfare and protection, childcare, youth justice, early childhood care and education and responsibility for the National Children's Strategy. This structure will facilitate the development of a strategic and co-ordinated approach to children's policy and the delivery of services, both at national and local level.I am confident that, through the targeted measures already being taken by this Government, and the initiatives being planned, a decisive and lasting impact will be made in the eradication of child poverty.

There are two strands to the scheme, the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance for the self-employed and the Back to Work Allowance for employees. The allowance was introduced in September 1993 when long term unemployment stood at 8.9%. In its early years the scheme proved very effective in helping people who had been long-term unemployed to return to the labour force.The scheme reached its peak in October 2000, when there were 39,343 participants, compared to 8,659 at the end of last month. The lower numbers on the scheme now reflect our success in reducing long-term unemployment to historically low levels.An independent evaluation of the BTW programme was conducted on behalf of my Department by Indecon International Economic Consultants in 2000. In recognition of the difficulties being experienced by some people returning to the labour force after 3 or 5 years of attachment to the live register, the qualifying period for access to both the employment and self-employment strands of Back to Work was reduced to 2 years with effect from March 2006. Also with effect from March 2006 periods spent on Supplementary Welfare Allowance or in the Direct Provision System count towards the qualifying period for Back to Work Allowance.My Department will monitor the effect of these changes on the take up of the scheme. In addition the scheme will be monitored to ensure its relevance to current labour market conditions and to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market to gain a foothold into sustainable employment or self-employment. In the meantime, I have no plans to make further changes to the scheme at this time.Details of the numbers of participants and of expenditure on the scheme in the period 2000 to 2005 are set out in the table.YearRecipients of Back to Work ProgrammeExpenditure on Scheme€m200039,343167.8200132,191157.6200224,986129.1200317,06997.4200411,56665.720058,94353.6
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The part-time job incentive is a weekly in-work income supplement which provides an allowance for people who are in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance and employed on a part-time basis for up to 24 hours per week, provided they continue to make efforts to find full-time work. The allowance is not taxable or subject to PRSI. There is no income limit to continued receipt of the allowance. At present, there are 239 recipients countrywide.The low take up of this allowance is primarily due to the introduction and improvements in alternative, more favourable employment support measures over the years, in particular the back to work programme and the family income supplement. For instance, if the employment is likely to develop into a lasting job for at least 20 hours per week, the back to work scheme is a better option than the part-time job incentive, as it enables the recipient to keep a substantial part of the unemployment payment, tapered over three years. Also, as the back to work programme is a time-limited transitional payment, arrangements are in place for the retention of secondary benefits, subject to certain income limits.A further alternative to the part-time job incentive is the family income supplement, where low-income employees with children who work more than 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight receive an in-work income support. This is currently paid to 18,647 recipients at an average weekly payment of EUR102.32.Retention of secondary benefits applies for a limited period in specified circumstances, such as where a qualified person returns to full-time work after twelve months unemployed, or while participating in certain educational or training programmes. There is no provision for such an arrangement where a person is in receipt of an ongoing in-work income support such as the part-time job allowance or the family income supplement.I have no plans at present to introduce any change in these arrangements. Any such change would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the context of competing priorities.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 115 together.The primary objective of the orphan's payments administered by my Department is to provide income support in respect of children whose parents are deceased or who are unable and have failed to provide for them. The definition of an orphan for the purpose of the allowance was extended in 1995 specifically to include children where the parents are still alive but have abandoned or refused or failed to provide for them. This was seen as a necessary response to changes in family and social circumstances.Current figures indicate that there are approximately 1000 recipients of the orphan's contributory allowance and a further 600 recipients of the orphan's non-contributory pension. Grandparents can and do claim for their children in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy. Indeed, informal statistics compiled by officials in my Department suggest that grandparents may make up between 40 and 50% of all claimants in respect of these schemes. My Department's orphans' payments provide a rate of payment of €138 per week. This is a substantially higher rate compared with other payments made by my Department in respect of children.Foster carers, on the other hand, operate within a very specific framework and the foster care allowance is intended, not only to provide income support, but to recompense foster carers for the expense incurred in relation to looking after a child who would otherwise be in institutional care. Foster carers are therefore subject to rigorous scrutiny and ongoing monitoring by the health boards, and the children in their care are subject to a care plan.There are no plans to review either the eligibility criteria in relation to the schemes, or standardise the rates of payment under these schemes.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	478	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.My Department is very conscious of the need to facilitate persons in receipt of social welfare payments to take up employment and other progression opportunities. There are currently two separate types of tapering arrangements in place to ensure that rent supplement is structured to support this objective. The first of these tapers the amount of rent supplement by reference to the household's overall income. This applies under the standard means test, which is available to all persons in part-time employment including people on approved employment schemes. The amount of rent supplement payable is reduced as the person's earnings increase.The other tapering arrangement tapers the amount of rent supplement over time rather than by reference to income. This benefits people participating on certain approved employment schemes or those returning to full-time employment after a period of twelve months unemployment. Under this arrangement, the amount of rent supplement payable is reduced out over a four year period, subject to certain conditions.In cases where a person qualifies for both tapering arrangements, they can take up the arrangement that is most beneficial to them. Increasingly, this is the taper based on income which applies under the standard rules of the rent supplement scheme. Under those rules, rent or mortgage interest supplements are calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent or mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of EUR13 which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.Where a person avails of an employment opportunity and the employment is less than 30 hours per week, up to EUR60 per week is disregarded and 50% of additional income between EUR60 and EUR90 per week is also disregarded in the means test thus ensuring a tapered withdrawal of assistance as a person's earnings increase. In addition, any amount of family income supplement payable is disregarded in the standard means test, ensuring that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity. For those participating in approved employment schemes, any lunch or travel allowances that are paid may also be disregarded. In addition, certain training courses now provide a childcare allowance to participants, Budget 2006 provided that these childcare allowances are to be treated in the same manner as a lunch or travel allowance and disregarded.For those participating on certain approved employment schemes or to those returning to full-time employment after a period of twelve months unemployment they may retain a proportion of their rent supplement payment on a tapered basis over a four year period subject to a household income limit of EUR317.43 per week. Under these arrangements 75% of the supplement is retained in year one, 50% in year two with 25% retained in years three and four. Significant improvements have been made to the means test subsequently.Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the EUR317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test. In effect this means that people who commence employment through a back to work scheme, following a period of unemployment, can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the EUR317.43 limit and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement.Overall I consider that the current tapered withdrawal arrangements for the rent supplement ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up both training and employment opportunities, but I will continue to keep the issue under review. I would also mention that these arrangements are being considered further in the context of a policy review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is due to be completed shortly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 74 together.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive. While my Department has responsibility for devising an overall control strategy for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the development, implementation and co-ordination of control measures is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.All Community Welfare Officers and Superintendent Community Welfare Officers are involved in control of SWA payments on a daily basis, making control work an integral part of service delivery. Control work commences when a person makes an application and is maintained during the life of the claim by way of reviews of entitlement, random checks and cross checks of claims to ensure that the client continues to be entitled to the payment. In addition, targeted control work is also carried out by the Health Service Executive.The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledges that a significant amount of control work is undertaken and that overpayments of rent supplement are being detected. The Comptroller and Auditor General is however critical of the fact that it is not clear how effective the control work is or if the control activity is targeted in the areas of greatest risk. I accept those points.In this regard my Department together with the Community Welfare Service of the HSE is in the process of completing a fraud and error survey on rent supplement. My Department also intends undertaking a control risk assessment for the SWA scheme including rent supplement. This will provide an opportunity to identify those aspects of the scheme where stricter levels of control might be required. The comments of the C&AG have been made known to the Executive and my Department will be ensuring that controls remains a priority in ensuring that the scheme meets it correct target group.As Deputies are aware the Government decided that income support and maintenance schemes administered by the Community Welfare Service division of the Health Service Executive should be transferred to my Department. Work has commenced in implementing this decision and I believe the move will provide a further opportunity to address many of the points raised in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report including the issues of control and overall administration.I am aware of the increases in rent supplement recipients and expenditure as identified in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. During the period 2000 to 2005, recipient numbers rose from 42,700 to just over 60,000 with expenditure rising from EUR151m to EUR369m. Approximately one third of the overall increase in spending on rent supplements can be explained by increases in the number of recipients, while the remaining two-thirds is attributed to increases in the average rent supplement payment. The increase in the average rent supplement payment is itself attributable to a number of factors, including family size, location and rent level.The rent supplement scheme was not designed to provide for an individual's long-term accommodation needs. However, in recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists. In response to this situation, the Government has introduced new rental assistance arrangements giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis.When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public/private partnership type rental accommodation scheme. This approach provides a better outcome for the tenants in question and it will also provide better value for money for the taxpayer.I do not propose to replace the rent supplement scheme with a new housing benefit scheme and the Government is not considering any such proposal. Our priority is to provide housing for those who need it, not to provide an income supplement in lieu of housing. The reform of the rent supplement scheme, the development of the local authority rental accommodation scheme and the very considerable investment in a wide range of social and affordable housing options taken together represent, in my view, a better use of resources than a housing benefit scheme.

The results of the most recent survey, announced in December 2005, show continuing positive trends in relation to poverty and social exclusion, and the impact being made by the greatly increased resources now devoted to social welfare and other social services.Results from the first two years of EU-SILC show that there has been a slight decrease in the percentage of persons ‘at risk of poverty', whose income falls below the 60 per cent median income threshold, from 19.7 per cent in 2003 to 19.4 per cent in 2004. These figures are beginning to reflect the impact of the continuing high level of resources being devoted to supporting those at risk of poverty and suggest that the numbers in that category may have peaked and are beginning to decline.It should be noted that those below the 60 per cent of median income threshold are categorised as being ‘at risk of poverty', but many may not actually be in poverty, as generally understood. That depends on other factors such as the extent to which their income is below the threshold, the length of time they have been living on a low income, the degree to which their assets will have run down while on a low income, and the other resources they have at their disposal. Those experiencing poverty as generally understood are said to be in consistent poverty and the numbers in that category are also identified by EU-SILC.The most recent EU-SILC survey also found that there has been a significant reduction in the consistent poverty rate. This is calculated by identifying from among those in the ‘at risk of poverty' category persons who are also deprived of basic goods and services regarded as essential for living in Ireland today. This percentage reduced from 8.8 per cent in 2003 to 6.8 per cent in2004.With regard to data on child poverty, the EU-SILC survey reported that in 2004 9.5 per cent of persons under the age of 15 were in consistent poverty, a reduction from the 2003 figure of 12.2 per cent. There was a slight rise in the numbers of persons under the age of 15 at risk of poverty from 21.0 per cent in 2003 to 21.2 per cent in 2004. Some 100,000 children have been lifted out of deprivation in the last decade as a result of targeted measures and supports. It is estimated that some 65,000 children remain in consistent poverty and moving these children out of poverty remains my priority.It may also be important to note trends over a longer period which have caused some confusion. When making comparisons with previous trends, it is necessary to refer to EU-SILC's predecessor, the Living in Ireland Survey (LIIS), which was conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) between 1994 and 2001. While the ‘at risk of poverty' rates between the two surveys are broadly comparable this is not the case with the consistent poverty measure. The CSO and the ESRI attributed the increase recorded in consistent poverty between 2001 and 2003 to methodological differences between the EU-SILC and LIIS surveys. Accordingly, it was not possible to draw any conclusions on how consistent poverty actually changed in this period. There is no evidence that the actual level of consistent poverty would have increased during these years, as there were no policy changes that would have reversed the earlier downward trends. On the contrary, significant improvements in social welfare rates and in other services had been made in the intervening period and the EU-SILC results for 2004 now suggest that the downward trend recorded in the LIIS continues.The main indicators show that significant progress had been made in the last decade in tackling poverty and specifically child poverty. Much of child poverty is related to the position of the households where children live. The major reduction in unemployment and, in particular, long term unemployment, the significant increases in employment participation resulting in the growth in two income households and the huge improvements in real terms in social welfare payments and related services have greatly helped to improve the position not only of adults but also of their children.The National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion (NAP/inclusion) is a key instrument in that regard. A review of implementation of the plan, undertaken in June 2005, found that some 51 of its 58 targets and commitments had either been met or were in the process of being met. A new plan which will significantly build on the progress being made, covering the two year period from 2006 to 2008, is currently being prepared.The surveys and indicators also show that the families with children most at risk of poverty are large families and those headed by lone parents. Many of these families have not been able to avail of the greatly increased employment opportunities and the related higher incomes that accrue from employment. A range of reforms and increased welfare supports, child-centered services and child care are addressing these problems. These include: radical reforms of the schemes for lone parents and the qualified adults of social welfare beneficiaries, payment of the €1,000 a year early childcare supplement for all children under 6 years, increases in welfare supports and entitlements in real terms; and the creation of additional childcare places.These measures are part of a wider programme being prepared to support children to apply over the next 10 years, which is among the most ambitious ever undertaken in the State. A key priority for the Government is to make a decisive impact on child poverty by ensuring that the position of children who are vulnerable to poverty receives special support under this programme consistent with their needs.

It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are living alone and who receive payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes.The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. It was introduced in 1977 at the rate of £1.00 (EUR1.27) per week. The amount and effective date of each increase to the payment is given in the table.The latest figures available show that there were 150,551 people in receipt of the living alone increase at end March 2006, at a cost of about EUR1.16 million per week. The cost of increasing the living alone increase to EUR10 per week is estimated at approximately EUR346,300 per week or EUR18.4 million per annum.The living alone increase is a targeted measure aimed at a particular group of pensioners. However, the policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than focusing on payments such as the living alone increase. This approach ensures that resources are used to improve the position of all pensioners. The position will be kept under review in the context of future budgets.DateAmount (Punts)Euro Equivalent£€01/04/19771.001.2707/04/19781.101.4006/04/19791.301.6504/04/19801.652.1003/04/19812.052.6002/10/19812.152.7302/04/19822.703.4301/07/19833.003.8106/07/19843.204.0612/07/19853.404.3218/07/19863.554.5124/07/19873.704.7029/07/19883.804.8328/07/19893.904.9527/07/19904.105.2126/07/19914.305.4631/07/19924.505.7130/07/19934.705.9729/07/19944.806.0916/06/19954.906.2214/06/19966.007.6204/01/20026.067.70** Resulted from a general rounding up of rates consequent on the introduction of the Euro.

The scheme will enable pensioners resident here to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland will travel free of charge on services in this State.In July 1995, my Department introduced the cross border free travel scheme. This scheme extended free travel entitlement so that free travel pass holders resident in Ireland could undertake a cross-border journey from a point of departure in one jurisdiction to a destination in the other jurisdiction free of charge. The introduction of an all-Ireland free travel scheme would further extend the existing arrangements by allowing pass holders to take onward journeys free of charge to them.My Department covers the full cost of cross-border journeys made by Department of Social and Family Affairs pass holders. It also covers the cost of the southern element of cross-border journeys undertaken by Northern Ireland pass holders. Under its own concessionary fares scheme, the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland covers the cost of the northern element of cross-border bus and rail journeys made by Northern Ireland pass holders.Some 220,000 cross-border journeys are undertaken each year at a total cost of EUR3.3m; my Department pays EUR2.9m and the remaining €0.4m is covered by the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland.Intensive discussions in relation to the introduction of the proposed all-Ireland free travel scheme have taken place between officials from my Department and their counterparts in the Department for Regional Development for Northern Ireland. Discussions have also been held at ministerial level, and the matter was raised by the Taoiseach with the Prime Minister. I will continue to focus on delivering a suitable scheme at the earliest possible date.

There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions.Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, The Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Pensions Board also has a role in relation to the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act is concerned. However, the main difficulties with the scheme relate to failure to register employees and/or to deduct contributions to the scheme and these issues are a matter for the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, The Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Given the ongoing controversy in relation to the scheme and compliance with its terms, the Pensions Board facilitated a report on the scheme in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The report was undertaken by Mercer Human Resource Consulting and it found that 80% of the estimated 80,000 eligible employees in the industry are covered by the scheme. However, the report does highlight the fact that an estimated 70,000 operatives are classed as self-employed and are therefore not eligible to join the scheme. The consultants are of the view that many of these workers are not genuinely self-employed.Mercer have made a range of recommendations designed to improve compliance with the scheme involving the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department. Copies of the report were provided to the relevant Ministers.In relation to my own Department, the report has recommended that consideration be given to using the PRSI system as a means of enforcing the scheme and collecting contributions. This gives rise to a number of major issues, not least of which is the extent to which the Department should be directly involved in the administration of, what is, a private pension scheme. Major legislative change would be required and the accounting and operational arrangements of the PRSI system would need to be adapted to meet the very different needs and requirements of a funded pension system. The changes in relation to the scheme announced recently, which will see the creation of individual pension accounts for workers, would make this even more difficult.Putting the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency on a statutory footing and dealing with issues in relation to self-employment in the industry, as also proposed in the Mercer report, are in my view the ways forward. The former is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and I have contacted him to seek his views on the prospects for progress in this area.In the meantime, I have asked my Department to see to what extent it can assist generally, having regard to the programme of inspections of employers' records. My Department is planning to carry out 7,000 employer inspections in the current year, and in this context, a greater emphasis will be placed on the construction sector.With regard to self-employment, designations are, in the first instance, generally made by the Revenue Commissioners. However, it is open at any time to an individual to ask for a determination on his or her employment status for social insurance purposes from my Department.Finally, following a meeting I had with trade unions representing construction workers, I was in touch with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in relation to ensuring that contractors being awarded public sector contracts are complying with their obligations under the Construction Federation Operatives Pensions Scheme. This issue is currently under consideration.

Similarly, under the Liability to Maintain the Family provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, absent parents have a responsibility to support their children and this is pursued by the Department where the absent parent is not making sufficient effort to provide adequate support.The report referred to by the Deputy which is in essence a preliminary report, is now to hand. This report provides an indicative estimate of the number of liable relatives contributing to the support of their children and recommends the undertaking of a special project by the Maintenance Recovery Unit of my Department in this area in an attempt to better estimate the numbers of liable relatives contributing.Over the next three months the Maintenance Recovery Unit will examine the circumstances of the liable relatives of all newly awarded one-parent family payment claims and assess the level of contribution, through maintenance payments or other supports, being made in respect of the children. On completion, a report will be compiled outlining the findings and including proposals in relation to how best the Department might interact with the full liable relative population going forward.At present 2,290 liable relatives are making payments directly to my Department's Maintenance Recovery Unit (MRU) on foot of maintenance determination orders issued by the Unit. There are also 17,798 lone parent customers receiving reduced rate payments and it is estimated that the receipt of maintenance payments is a factor in approximately 9,700 of these cases, based on an analysis of the casework undertaken in the MRU over the past 5 years. In addition, there is a substantial number of cases where absent parents are or have been making some contribution to lone parents either by direct cash contributions or indirectly in the form of meeting the educational or other costs of children, which does not result in a reduction in payment for the lone parent. The project currently underway aims to better quantify the number of such cases and the financial circumstances of the absent parents involved.

There are now 7,609 farm assist customers. The current average weekly payment is EUR 174.07.The level of take-up is less than had been anticipated when the scheme was first introduced in April 1999. This is due to the significant increase in off-farm employment in recent years and the take up of the Rural Social Scheme which is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and which also specifically targets low-income farmers.The farm assist scheme has brought about a worthwhile improvement for low income farmers and particularly for those with children and it makes a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum. To increase awareness of the farm assist scheme, my Department undertook a major publicity campaign in 2002. Almost EUR100,000 was spent on the campaign which consisted of radio and press advertising, including specialist farming publications, and the production of a promotional video on the scheme.More generally, the network of Social Welfare Offices and Citizen's Information Offices throughout the country provide information to members of the public on the range of schemes and services available, including the farm assist scheme. Information leaflets and applications forms for farm assist are available at these offices. In addition, Social Welfare Inspectors in rural areas promote the scheme when meeting customers in the course of their duties.

This follow-up activity takes place within 2-3 weeks of the award of payment.The number of one parent family payment recipients being paid by my Department at the end of April 2006 was 83,248. Included in this figure are 914 payments to widowed persons where maintenance is not an issue. In the period January 2003 to May 2006, the Maintenance Recovery Unit has examined 63,289 cases and issued determination orders to 8,958 liable relatives. During this period total savings arising from the work of this unit have amounted to EUR 56.9 million.Of the 63,289 cases examined in the period January 2003 to May 2006, some 17,447 lone parents indicated that they were in receipt of maintenance payments from their former spouses, or, in the case of unmarried applicants, the other parent of their child. It is estimated that a further 9,700 lone parents are in receipt of a reduced rate payment by reason of maintenance. A total of 2,290 liable relatives contribute directly to the Department. Taken together these figures indicate that in excess of 40% of liable relatives are contributing to the support of their children.Over the last number of years a total of 182 cases has been selected for court action. The aim behind this activity is to secure maintenance from non-compliant liable relatives.In an effort to better estimate the numbers of absent parents not paying maintenance, the Maintenance Recovery Unit of my Department will, over the next 3 months, undertake a special project to examine the circumstances of the liable relatives of all newly awarded one-parent family payment claims and assess the level of contribution, through maintenance payments or through the meeting of educational or other costs, being made in respect of the children. The findings of this project will be used to assess how best the Department might interact with the liable relative population.

The report puts forward proposals for reform of the income support system for all parents on a low income. The report proposes the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new Parental Allowance for low income families with young children.The current one-parent family payment provides long term income support, until children are 18 or 22 if in full-time education, to those parenting alone, with no requirement to be available for or seeking employment. Such long term welfare dependency in respect of a person of working age is not considered to be in the best interests of the lone parent, their children or society in general. Numerous reports have indicated that employment is one of the most important routes out of poverty.Under the proposed parental allowance, it is suggested that an element of conditionality be attached to receipt of the payment. Overall the report considers that payment of parental allowance should cease when the youngest child reaches the end of their 7th year. This being the case, formal activation would commence when the child was age 5. This would give the parent the opportunity and supports required to engage in education or training for three years, before payment of parental allowance would cease.Activation, as referred to in the proposal, is ‘positive' in nature; it encompasses interview/advice meetings, education and training and providing people with the skills to enable them to achieve financial independence and therefore, a better life for themselves and their children. While conditions are being suggested for receipt of payment, it is proposed that supports will be offered in a structured and systematic manner to the persons concerned. It is in this context that continuing payment would be made conditional on engagement.I would also stress that the discussion paper acknowledges that the age to which the parental allowance should remain payable is a matter for decision by Government following the consultation process currently underway. I have listened carefully to the comments made by organisations representing lone parents at the recent consultation forum I hosted and have asked them to submit their views and concerns in writing. I will take all of these views into account to arrive at the best possible solution for all.I have asked the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations of the discussion paper, including those related to childcare, education, training and activation measures and work on this has already commenced in consultation with the Departments and agencies concerned. Issues including the impact of the proposals on the qualified adult allowance, the limitation rule and those lone parents who are already in work will be taken into account in the implementation of the proposals.As a follow-up to the publication of the discussion paper, I hosted a National Consultative Forum on 27th April 2006. This Forum was attended by social partners, representatives of organisations dealing with lone parents and the unemployed, representatives of Government departments and State agencies who will be responsible for the implementation of the proposals in the discussion paper and members of the Oireachtas.At the Forum, I heard the views of each organisation on the proposals including their comments on the proposed parental allowance and invited them to make a formal written submission setting out those views. I also met with representatives of the One Parent Exchange Network on 14 June to discuss the proposals. I have also briefed the Oireachtas Committee on Social Affairs and debated the issue in the Seanad.I will listen closely to the views expressed and will give very serious consideration to them. As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are fully workable and equitable, it will be my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in the course of this year.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I have examined the research carried out by the Combat Poverty Agency on the issue of a waiver system for refuse charges. In 2003 the Combat Poverty Agency published a report entitled "Waste Collection Charges and Low-Income Households". This report identified the privatization of waste collection charges and the abolition of waivers as factors causing indebtedness among some households.In light of this, a later report, "Implementing a Waiver System: Guidelines for Local Authorities" which was published in October 2005 examined three possible models for the operation of a waiver system: a locally based system; a tax credit system and a social welfare system. Advantages and disadvantages of each model were presented but the report concluded that a locally operated waiver system would offer the most effective delivery model.I am in agreement with the Combat Poverty Agency in that regard. The setting of waste management charges and the introduction of waivers in respect of waste charges is, as stated by my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, a matter for each local authority. The introduction of a national social welfare scheme to address the issue would be complex given the wide range of charging regimes and cost structures that exist in respect of waste management throughout the State. Any system put in place to assist people who rely on private domestic waste collection would have to be sensitive to the different local arrangements.I intend to keep the matter under review and to monitor the experience of welfare customers under various charging systems and cost structures.

Through the partnership process, we have helped to ensure that the policies of Government and the efforts of the social partners create the right environment for sustainable economic and social development.The prosperity secured in partnership has a purpose — it is to improve the quality of life of our people, including those dependent on social welfare. This is best achieved when there is a reasonable consensus about the choices we face as a country.I welcome the draft Social Partnership agreement ‘Towards 2016', which has put in place the policies and the delivery systems, which will allow us to realise our full potential. Negotiations are still ongoing with the Farming Pillar and are expected to be completed shortly.The new social partnership agreement will provide a positive framework for addressing the issues of poverty and social exclusion in a comprehensive, focussed and integrated manner. The implementation of the agreement, allied to the achievement of the targets set out in the National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion will ensure that we will make real and tangible progress towards the achievement of a fair and inclusive society.

Pensions coverage for the key target group, those aged 30 years and over, stood at 58.6% in the 1st quarter of 2005. This coverage rate has moved little in recent years. The Pensions Board completed its work in November 2005 and I published the report in January.The Board has reaffirmed the various targets recommended in the original National Pensions Policy Initiative which included a retirement income, from all sources, of 50% of pre-retirement income, a social welfare pension equating to 34% of average industrial earnings and a supplementary pensions coverage rate of 70% for those aged over 30 years. The Pensions Board has recommended enhancements to the current voluntary system of supplementary pensions as it considers that it has the potential to deliver significant improvements in coverage.However, no truly voluntary pensions system has delivered the sort of coverage rates for which we are aiming. I have said on many occasions that if we are to achieve our overall targets we may have to consider a more radical approach. Accordingly, I have asked the Pensions Board to explore in more detail the ideas for a mandatory or quasi-mandatory system it put forward in its report on the National Pensions Review. The ideas explored in the Pensions Review range from a mandatory system built up on the existing private sector system to a greater role in pensions provision for the PRSI system.As part of the review the Board will examine the UK's proposed Pensions Savings Scheme. This proposal involves employees being automatically enrolled into a pension when they start a new job. They will be able to opt out, but if they do not, they will be obliged to pay in 4% of any earnings between £5,000 and £33,000 a year. This will be matched with 3% from their employer and 1% from the State.I expect to receive the Board's final report in the coming weeks. The challenge in the months ahead will be to agree on a set of reforms which will deliver on the objective of an adequate income for all in retirement.

There are 52 independent companies nation-wide operating the service and support is provided by MABS National Development Limited, a support company for the service. MABS was established on a pilot basis in 1992 and it has now grown to a countrywide service with a budget of EUR 16.41 million.The programme provides money advice to individuals and families who have problems with debt and who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. It places an emphasis on practical budget-based measures that help people to move permanently from dependence on moneylenders and to access alternative sources of low cost credit, particularly in their local credit union. Many voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, credit unions, Citizens' Information Centres, Centres for the Unemployed, the clergy, Garda, and local authorities work closely with the programme.The Government is keen to get more quality information on the nature and trends of the debt encountered as well as the categories of people using the MABS so as to better inform policy around over-indebtedness and also allow the MABS to be even more responsive to its clients' needs. In this respect I am pleased with the introduction of a new software application which has been developed for the specific use of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service — MABSIS (Money Advice and Budgeting Service Integrated System). That computer system was delivered on time and within budget.It is a most important facility and, as well as easing the administrative burden on staff, it will provide very useful data around indebtedness which will in turn inform development of policy around money advice and budgeting. Last year alone almost 27,000 people used the service as compared with almost 18,000 some 4 years earlier. The demand on the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit and to the quality of the service provided by the MABS staff. This year I have increased the allocation from my Department to the MABS Service by in excess of twenty percent to assist the MABS in dealing with this increased workload.In November 2005 I informed the MABS National Advisory Committee that I intended to review the MABS Bill 2002 and invited each of the stakeholders to make submissions to me with a view to producing a more effective structure. I have received a number of submissions which I am now considering in order to provide a suitable framework to ensure that the service remains responsive in the coming years.I believe the support structure put in place in recent years has been invaluable for management and staff and has been very effective in the areas of Community Education, Social Policy and Communications. I also believe that a national system with delivery at the local level is the direction for the future. The Service at present is highly regarded and respected and it is important that this continues to be the case.It is my intention to have legislation enacted as early as possible in order to put the service on a sounder footing to continue its extremely important role in assisting people deal with indebtedness.

Payments to carers have been greatly improved over that period and qualifying conditions for carers allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carers benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced. The further development of support for carers continues to be a priority for me and for Government.I have examined the Joint Oireachtas Committee's ‘Report on the Position of Full-Time Carers', which was published in 2003. This valuable report makes a range of recommendations, many of which relate to my Department and a number of which concern the Department of Health and Children. In response to the Committee, who stated that the greatest need identified by family carers is the need for a break from caring, I have made several improvements to the respite care grant.In 2005 I extended the grant to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their source of income or their means. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding unemployment assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition. In addition the grant is now paid in respect of each person receiving care. In Budget 2006, I made provision for an increase in the amount of the respite care grant from EUR 1,000 to EUR 1,200, from this month.The Joint Oireachtas Committee's Report also recommended that where a person who is caring for someone and is in receipt of a widow's or widower's pension he or she should receive a half rate carer's allowance. The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and, as a general rule, only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual. This ensures that resources are not used to make two income support payments to any one person. Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments always receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.In Budget 2006, I provided for a significant increase in the rate of carer's allowance. From January this year, the rate of carer's allowance increased to EUR200 per week for carers aged 66 years and over. This rate of payment may be higher in many instances than the rate of old age pension or widow(er)'s pension payable to a person. Such a person who is providing full time care and attention to a person who requires such care may be entitled to receive this higher rate of carer's allowance.In addition, the means test for carer's allowance has been eased significantly over the years, most notably with the introduction of the disregards of spouses' earnings. Following Budget 2006, since April, a couple with two children can earn up to EUR32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple will be able to earn up to EUR54,400 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance as well as the free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.The full-time care and attention requirements for carer's allowance were relaxed from August 1999 to introduce greater flexibility into the carer's allowance scheme, while still safeguarding the needs and interests of care recipients. This allowed carers to work for up to 10 hours per week and it was introduced in recognition of the economic and therapeutic values of work. It also allows carers to maintain contact with the labour market. From 1 June this year I have increased the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self employment or training and education and still be deemed to be providing full time care and attention from 10 to 15 hours per week. This applies to carer's allowance, carer's benefit and respite care grant.I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me. Those recommendations involving additional expenditure can only be considered in a budgetary context.

Information relating to occupational diseases regarding miners is only held by my Department in the context of claims made under its Occupational Injuries Benefit scheme. Pneumoconiosis is a prescribed disease for the purpose of this scheme. The legislation governing the Occupational Injuries Scheme provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease. In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for Occupational Injuries Benefit under the Social Welfare Acts. Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim. If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive Disability Benefit or Invalidity Pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.Miners may be entitled to Disablement Benefit if they suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.Persons claiming Occupational Injuries Benefit in cases of Pneumoconiosis are referred to Consultant Respiratory Physicians in the first instance for an examination and report. This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing (PFT). Disablement benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant's report, including the pulmonary function test result. The degree of disablement is expressed as a percentage of loss of faculty and the compensation payable varies accordingly.Loss of faculty may be determined within a range of less than 1% to 100%, depending on the severity of the condition. With regard to the 21 persons currently in receipt of disablement benefit as a result of contracting pneumoconiosis arising from their occupation, the percentage of disablement assessed ranges from 8% to 90%. Expenditure in 2006 for payment of disablement benefit to these recipients will be in excess of €86,000. If all current recipients were assessed at 100% disablement, the total expenditure for 2006 would be over €214,000.A person must be assessed as having a minimum of 20% loss of faculty before they may be considered as being incapable of work due to their disablement. There would no justification for special arrangements in this regard in the case of Pneumoconiosis.

A total of 16.41 million euro in funding has been allocated to MABS in 2006, which represents an increase of in excess of twenty percent over the 2005 figure. The service is targeted at those who are on low income or in receipt of social welfare payments. There are 52 MABS companies located in 65 offices throughout the country.The Money Advice and Budgeting Service has a close and ongoing involvement with my Department at local level. Representatives of the Department are on the boards of management of MABS companies. Membership is also drawn from statutory and voluntary bodies such as the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, Credit Unions, Citizens Information Centres and the Community Welfare Service. These representatives in turn raise awareness of issues around over-indebtedness in their parent bodies.Following the release of the report "Do the Poor Pay More" I met with the Irish Banking Federation (IBF) and the Irish Payment Services Organisation (IPSO) and explored ways in which those in the low income bracket could access financial services. Since the introduction of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service in 1992 a good working relationship has been developed between that service and the Irish Bankers Federation. The recent meeting identified a number of areas where it was felt that progress could be made in facilitating wider access to financial services.MABS National Development Limited (MABSndl) was established in 2004 to support, promote and develop the MABS service. The company is currently working on the development of a national strategy in community education, which will be implemented by the 52 MABS companies. This strategy will seek to empower individuals and communities in developing the skills necessary to deal with debt situations as they arise.The MABS development company is also devising a strategy to assist the MABS local services to improve further the take up of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service by those on low income. Recent initiatives include media interviews, co-operation with the One Parent Exchange Network (OPEN), the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA), the Courts Service Information Section, Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, Age Action and Hospital Social Workers.My Department ensures that MABS information and contact details are included in all relevant social welfare publications and information material produced by the Department. The level of response to MABS indicates there is a high level of awareness of the service. However, I will continue to examine any proposals that would further extend the level of public awareness.The Service at present is highly regarded and respected and it is important that this continues to be the case. It plays a vital role in assisting persons to be socially and financially included. It is my intention to have legislation enacted as early as possible in order to put the service on a sounder footing to continue its extremely important role in assisting people deal with indebtedness.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Occupational pensions in Ireland are voluntary arrangements and, as such, the employer can change the terms of these arrangements. I am aware that there are many pressures on Defined Benefit schemes emanating from the need for employers to increase contributions to schemes, to meet the requirements of accounting standards (FRS17) and also the Funding Standard under the Pensions Act.The latest figures from the Pensions Board show that as at the 31st of December 2005 there were 1,258 defined benefit schemes registered with the Pensions Board which were subject to the minimum funding standard. In 2005 the Board were notified of the winding-up of a total of 48 group defined benefit schemes. There is no requirement for employers or scheme sponsors to notify the Pensions Board where the nature of a scheme is changed, though a survey undertaken in 2003 suggested that the majority of defined benefit schemes remained open to new members. Defined contribution schemes transfer the investment risk to the employee and there are also concerns about the adequacy of contributions being made to such schemes.As already indicated, the Funding Standard and new accounting requirements (FRS17), which makes pension costs very apparent on a firm's balance sheet, are put forward as the two main reasons for the drift from defined benefit provision to defined contribution schemes. In relation to the Funding Standard this attempts to draw a reasonable balance between the interests of employers, who must fund pension schemes, and the legitimate expectations of employees to be guaranteed their pension.In 2003 my predecessor introduced short term measures designed to alleviate the funding crisis in pension schemes, which resulted from a major fall in equity values. The Pensions Board, on foot of a review of the Funding Standard completed in 2004, recommended retention of these provisions, which it found were largely successful. However, what has emerged clearly since these provisions were introduced is that the liability side of pension funds is also under severe pressure.Improved longevity, lower interest rates and regulation are just some of the factors increasing these liabilities. In the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005, I provided that an extended funding period may also be granted in relation to difficulties which defined benefit schemes were experiencing on the liability side. I believe these measures, which were introduced after extensive consultation, achieve the required balance between member protection and encouraging continued defined benefit pension provision.The Pensions Board, in consultation with key stakeholders, including officials from my Department, is continuing to review the funding standard for defined benefit schemes in the light of experience here and abroad over the last number of years, while also keeping in mind the original objective and intent of that standard. They will report to me later this year in this regard.In relation to the provision of information to members of schemes affected by changes to their scheme, trustees must account to members for how their scheme is run by providing them with a wide range of personal and scheme information as required under Part 5 of the Pensions Act 1990 and regulations made under this Part. Members of schemes must be informed of any significant changes to the pension scheme. In addition to these Disclosure Regulations, and in compliance with a recent EU Directive, regulations have also been made in relation to how the resources of a scheme are invested. The disclosure of information in a timely manner enables scheme members to monitor their benefits and the financial soundness of their pension schemes.The Board regards information disclosure and compliance with investment regulations as a very important governance requirement for pension schemes and takes steps to enforce this obligation where necessary. I will continue to monitor, in conjunction with the Board, trends in pension provision, the funding of schemes and the need of scheme members for ongoing information on the condition and status of their pension scheme.

Under these proposals my Department would seek to provide a single transparent system with a primary focus on the customer and a route map starting with the first point of engagement with the customer. This will involve an active outcome-focused individual case management of all social welfare customers of working age who are not progressing into employment or accessing training or employment opportunities.In addition, other Employment Support Schemes are reviewed on a continual basis to ensure their relevance and their continued effectiveness in reaching those most distant from the labour market.
  In recognition of the difficulties being experienced by some people returning to the labour force after 3 or 5 years of attachment to the live register, the qualifying period for access to both the employment and self-employment strands of Back to Work was reduced to 2 years with effect from March 2006. Also with effect from March 2006 periods spent on Supplementary Welfare Allowance or in the Direct Provision system count towards the qualifying period for Back to Work Allowance and the Back to Education Allowance. It was decided in budget 2006 to extend the National Employment Action Plan to persons aged 55 to 64 who were approaching six months on the live register. Such referrals are to commence no later than September.There is no evidence that EU migrant workers are having any significant impact on the welfare system here. There were 2,000 persons from the new member states of the EU on the Live Register at the end of April 2006, which amounts to less than 1% of the PPS Numbers (212,933) issued to citizens of these countries over the period January 2004 to April 2006. The figure for supplementary welfare allowance was 902 or 0.5% of the total PPS numbers issued. My officials monitor the impact of migrant workers on social welfare schemes on an ongoing basis.I have no plans to carry out a study of the impact of migrant workers at this time but I am aware of a study carried out by the Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies on labour market experiences in Ireland and Sweden following EU enlargement. This study concluded that to date the enlargement of the EU has not resulted in any disturbances in the Irish labour market and found no evidence of  displacement of native workers.

Neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to decisions on individual claims. The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.To qualify for rent supplement a person must satisfy a number of conditions. They must be a bona fide tenant, be habitually resident in the State, have a housing need and satisfy a means test. Also, the Health Service Executive must be satisfied that the accommodation is suited to the persons needs and the rent payable is within the prescribed limits.Typical processing time is three working days, but it can take longer in some instances. The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement in individual cases is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements, information from landlords etc. In addition, some aspects of the application are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the Executive. However this has to be achieved in a manner that is consistent with the demands of natural justice and the need to ensure that every case is fully investigated. While certain cases may take more time to process than others, overall, I am satisfied that the Executive makes every effort to decide rent supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner.

In cases where the liable relative does not comply with the requirement to pay maintenance the matter is pursued by the Department and this may include court action where appropriate.In addition to this, details of non-compliant liable relatives have been forwarded to the Revenue Commissioners for cross-checking to establish if they are in receipt of a one parent family tax credit which is administered by the Commissioners. This exchange of information has been made possible under Section 261(2) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.In order to qualify for a one parent family tax credit the claimant must prove that for the year of assessment the qualifying child is resident with him/her for the whole or part of the year. The payment of maintenance is not a qualifying condition for this tax credit, which, I understand, has a monetary value of EUR1,630 per annum.Officials in my Department have developed a working relationship with the Revenue Commissioners over the past number of years in relation to this matter. Since 2003 the maintenance recovery unit has referred information on approximately 350 cases to the Revenue Commissioners. It is intended that this reporting relationship will continue.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass. It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The free travel scheme applies to travel within the State and point to point cross border journeys between here and Northern Ireland. In line with the Government objective to put in place an all Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island, I am committed to significantly improving the North/South element of the current arrangements.There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK when they return to Ireland for a visit. I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel simply to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.Officials from my Department met with European Commission officials in April in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved. In the past few days the Commission's response to the issues raised at that meeting has become available and is currently being examined by my officials.

A fundamental qualifying condition for both the unemployment benefit scheme and unemployment assistance scheme is that a person must be available for full-time work.Where a person is employed for up to three days in a week, s/he may claim Unemployment Benefit in respect of the remainder of the week, subject to being available for full-time work. Benefit is not payable where a person is available for part-time work only.I recognise the development of a changing labour market with people wishing to have a choice of more flexible work patterns. In this context and to inform future policy in this area, a working group was set up under the Expenditure Review initiative to examine the application of the unemployment payment scheme conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis.The review will be finalised shortly and the report will be published over the summer period at which stage I will consider its recommendations.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The primary purpose of credited contributions is to protect the social insurance entitlement of insured workers who, for reasons relating either to incapacity, ill-health, unemployment or the provision of care (i.e. for children, the elderly or those with a disability) are not in a position to make PRSI payments.As a general rule, in order to qualify for credits, a person must be an employed contributor insured under PRSI Classes A, B, C, D, E or H. A recent attachment to the workforce is necessary to avail of credits in that he or she must have paid or credited contributions made in the last 2 complete income tax years. Where a worker has no recent contributions paid or credited, entitlement to credits can be re-established as soon as 26 contributions have been paid.Pre-entry credits are awarded only once in a person's working life to individuals when they have commenced as an employee for the first time. Credited contributions are designed to assist in establishing entitlement to short-term benefits as soon as possible after commencing employment. There is no legal provision for the award of credited contributions to those who re-enter the workforce as an employee having been temporarily absent from the active labour force.However, a range of alternatives are available to workers who withdraw from the work force temporarily. These include the homemakers scheme and the voluntary contributions scheme. The Homemakers Scheme aims to protect the old age pension rights of individuals who take time out from the workforce to care for either children (aged 12 years or younger) or incapacitated relatives. This scheme — introduced in April, 1994 — works by disregarding up to 20 full years spent on caring duties when averaging a person's social insurance record for pension purposes. The voluntary contribution scheme allows previously insured workers to maintain their entitlement to long-term benefits through the payment of voluntary PRSI contributions directly to my Department.Furthermore, my Department operates a number of schemes that cater exclusively for the needs of carers. These schemes provide both means-tested and social insurance-based payments to eligible claimants. The Carer's Allowance is a means-tested payment directed at carers on low incomes who live with and look after persons who require full-time attention. Carer's Benefit is a weekly social insurance payment that is based on PRSI contributions and that supports individuals who are entitled to statutory carer's leave and who give up their job temporarily in order to care for someone. Payments made under both these schemes may also qualify for the award of credited contributions for the duration of the payment.The range of social welfare supports available to carers is quite comprehensive and has been enhanced considerably in recent years. Budget 2006 contained very significant improvements in the level of support afforded to carers — including the biggest ever increases in the rates of social welfare payments available to them.I am satisfied that the circumstances in which credited contributions are awarded does not warrant re-examination at this stage. However, my Department constantly monitors the need for amendments or modifications to existing provisions to ensure that the social insurance system continues to meet social protection needs in a changing work and social environment.

At present the increase for a qualified adult on a contributory pension is 82% of the target rate. Spouses and partners of non-contributory pensioners receive a pension in their own right at age 66.Since 2002, new pension claimants can opt to have the qualified adult increase paid directly to their spouse or partner. The administrative and legislative implications of enhancing these arrangements to make direct payments more widely available are under consideration.The cost, based on current rates of payment, of bringing all of the relevant qualified adult rates up to the level of the non-contributory pension personal rate is €55 million in a full year. This commitment will be implemented having regard to available resources and other budgetary commitments.

Where a national of an EU state with a family is working in Ireland, the worker is entitled to payment of such benefits, even if the children of the worker are resident in the worker's home country.EU migrant workers in Ireland with an entitlement to family benefits are in one of two categories, those who have their families living with them in Ireland and those whose families reside in their home country. Applications for family benefits from EU migrant workers who come to live in Ireland with their families are dealt with under domestic legislation. Entitlement to Child Benefit is based on the applicant satisfying the Habitual Residency condition and the child being ordinarily resident in Ireland.Currently there are just under 30,000 EU nationals in receipt of Child Benefit for 53,000 children who are resident with them in Ireland. Of these the majority of recipients — some 16,500 — are UK nationals, with a further 8,000 recipients from the ten EU accession states.EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country have an entitlement to claim Family Benefits in Ireland under EU regulation 1408/71. At the start of 2006, Child Benefit was in payment under EU regulations for 650 families, in respect of 1320 children, resident outside of the Republic of Ireland. Some 90% of these children are resident in the UK. Currently there are some 950 families, with 1700 children receiving Child Benefit and resident outside Ireland. The majority of these are UK residents.The number of claims to Child Benefit and Early Child Supplement in respect of non resident EU nationals has, since the start of 2006, averaged close to 300 per week and is currently running at 350 per week compared to 20 per week in the same period in 2005.As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible at this point to forecast the position for the remainder of 2006 or 2007 with accuracy. This will depend on future immigration flows and indeed the number of non-national immigrants who decide to return home. This "churn" effect is difficult to quantify but it appears that some numbers of EU migrant workers may be staying in Ireland for relatively short periods of time. This will mean that those entitled to Child Benefit in 2006 may not be so entitled in 2007 or subsequent years. Best estimates at present would indicate that the numbers of applications may decline somewhat over the coming months as the backlog of applications dries up. New applications received will be from those EU nationals recently arriving to work in Ireland.It is likely that not every claim received for Child Benefit and ECS will be entitled to benefit. Additionally, some will only have an entitlement to payment of a reduced rate of child benefit as a "supplement" payment, (the supplement represents the difference between the rate of family benefits payable in the country of origin and the rate payable in the country of employment). If the majority of claims received in 2006 were to have an entitlement to Child Benefit, the total potential cost of Child Benefit this year for non resident EU national children could be in the region of EUR30 million or 1.5% of the overall Child Benefit budget of €2.04 billion this year.The Early Childcare Supplement will be payable to those families in receipt of Child Benefit from my Department with children under 6 years of age. If the number of claims were to continue at current levels, the number of non-resident children qualifying for the ECS payment could approach some 12,000 by the end of 2006.

The Office for Social Inclusion, based in my Department, co-ordinates the process mainly at national level, working closely with relevant Departments and the social partners.Specific responsibility for coordinating the development of social inclusion at local authority level rests with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This includes the policy direction and roll out of the Local Authority Social Inclusion units which have already made a valuable contribution to developing a strategic response to promoting social inclusion at local level. The Office for Social Inclusion works closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on social inclusion issues, including in particular the ongoing development of more effective structures for implementing the National Action Plan on social inclusion at local level.As part of this involvement, the Office is represented on the Social Inclusion Steering Group which co-ordinates the development and implementation of the Local Government Anti-Poverty Learning Network, with which the Combat Poverty Agency also has a strong involvement. This Network has already contributed significantly to the promotion of a strong local anti-poverty focus within the reformed system of local government, providing a forum in which local authorities can share experiences and best practice and consider how to make the maximum contribution to policies to tackle poverty and social exclusion. Representatives of the Local Authority Social Inclusion units are members of this learning network. In addition, the Office for Social Inclusion and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government recently organised a consultation seminar for local authority staff working in the area of social inclusion. The purpose of this seminar was to inform the development of the next NAP/inclusion, currently being prepared by the Office to cover the period 2006-2008.The issue of whether there should be an expansion of the social inclusion units and the extent of any such expansion is a matter for the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government, his Department and the Local Authorities concerned. Given the success of these Units to date, any such expansion would have my full support.

It assists couples to address the issues on which they need to make decisions including post-separation living arrangements, finances and parenting arrangements to enable children to have an on-going relationship with each parent. The benefits of family mediation as a non-adversarial approach to resolving the issues that arise on separation are increasingly being recognised worldwide.Over the past number of years the Family Mediation Service has radically expanded to meet a growing need for its service. Over the last few years, the Family Mediation Service has increased from 2 centres in Dublin and Limerick to 16 centres throughout the country. In the past month, two new FMS centres have opened, in Letterkenny to ensure effective access to the service in the North West and in Portlaoise to similarly expand the service in the Midlands.There has been a dramatic increase in the number of couples seeking mediation, as the benefits of mediation become more widely known. Last year the Service helped approximately 1500 couples — which compares with the figure of 250 a year who used the Service from 1986 up to the end of 1997 before its nation-wide expansion. I would like to pay tribute to the professionalism and hard work of the family mediators who have made a significant contribution to the promotion of the service over the years.In May of 2003 my predecessor took the development of the service one step further by establishing the Family Support Agency, which will provide a solid and secure base from which this important family service can grow and develop in the future. The Family Support Agency brings together the programmes and family support services formerly under the aegis of my Department. These include services to support families in times of difficulties including the Family Mediation Service, support for voluntary organisations providing counselling and other family supports and a Family Resource Centre programme, which supports and develops local communities. The Family Support Agency is responsible this year for a budget of over EUR20 million for the provision and development of its services.

The establishment of the Health Service Executive prompted a fresh consideration of the role and structure of the Community Welfare Service, and of the most appropriate location for that service in the future.The Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service noted in its report in 2003 that over the years the health system had been assigned responsibility for a number of services which might be regarded as non-core health activities. It recommended that the Government consider assigning non-core activities currently undertaken by agencies within the health service to other bodies.The Government decided to ask an interdepartmental group to examine this issue. The report of the interdepartmental group was subsequently submitted to, and accepted by, the Government. The report recommends, among other things, that income support and maintenance schemes, together with associated resources, should be transferred to my Department.This particular initiative has been mooted several times in the past — by the Report of the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 and by the Review of Supplementary Welfare Allowances by the Combat Poverty Agency in 1991. I welcome this decision as it provides an opportunity to bring about positive change for customers and staff and it is, I believe, a logical approach to provision of these services.An inter-departmental steering group, comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, has been established to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations. There are major organisational, human resource and service delivery issues involved in the transfer. The working group will consult with all relevant stakeholders in relation to this programme of change. I can assure the Deputy that a priority in the context of the transfer process will be to support the high standard of service currently provided by staff in the community welfare service.The transfer is a major change for all involved but I am confident it will be embraced successfully and will ultimately further enhance the delivery of services to our customers, in particular those who are most disadvantaged in the community.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The social welfare system is designed to provide income supports and access to relevant services in a timely manner to all our customers. The system is now neutral with regard to how it treats men and women; receipt of payment is generally dependent on contingency and other conditions being met. Levels of payment and how they apply are exactly the same for men and women. However, while there is equity in access to the system, the impact of past labour market experience and the traditional roles of women in the home, together with particular features of the social welfare system, can mean that women may be indirectly impacted upon within the system.The traditional model of social welfare was based on a male breadwinner model, with a father in full-time employment and mother as carer of the children, working full time in the home. Within this system, women tended to have derived rights to social welfare through, for example, their husband's social insurance records, with payments to women defined in relation to their husbands. This model reflected the environment in which the system operated and the roles of men and women in society.Significant changes have taken place in society in the past two decades and the social welfare system has changed to reflect these changes. Considerable reform and expansion has taken place in the social insurance system to make it as inclusive as possible.The main beneficiaries of the improvements in coverage and levels of social protection over the past 15 years have been women. For example, in 1991 those in part-time employment were brought into full social insurance cover, in 1995 community employment workers became insurable for all benefits and pensions, in 1997 coverage for maternity and adoptive benefits was extended to the self-employed and in 2002 there were changes to the PRSI contribution conditions which facilitated atypical workers and notably those worksharing. Alongside these changes the expansion of the labour market and changing attitudes towards women's roles have led to increasing numbers of women entering employment and being eligible for social insurance payments in their own right.The fundamental reforms I am proposing with regard to income support for lone parents and low income families will also address certain other features of the system which may impact more significantly on women. Under the proposals the contingency of lone parenthood would be abolished and instead a new Parental Allowance would be paid to all low income families with qualifying children. In couple households where a Parental Allowance was paid to one of the couple and another social assistance payment made to the other, no limitation on the overall payment to the household would apply. This would increase household income by up to €58 per week and recognises the increasing costs in households with young children.Another major aspect of the reform being proposed is the ending of the concept of ‘qualified adult' within the system of social assistance. Under the reform, where a household means test is met, all individuals would receive a payment in their own right, thus ensuring consistency in treatment and equity across the social welfare system and recognising the changing role of women in society and the labour market.These reforms represent a fundamental change in the social welfare system, moving away from derived entitlement to entitlement based on the individual. The social welfare system must reflect the environment in which it operates and meet the changing needs of citizens. One of the most significant changes which has taken place in Irish society is the changing role of women. The fundamental reforms I am proposing for the structure of means tested income support to families, together with the changes which have and will continue to take place in the social insurance system to reflect the changing labour market will ensure that the social welfare system reflects the changing needs of society.

The development of income supports which can make the most effective contribution to child poverty lies within my Department's responsibilities and a series of budgets have increased considerably in real terms the level of resources which are going to families with children.While the solutions to the problem of child poverty cover a wide range of measures, including income supports and services, I am committed to reviewing the role of child income supports in this regard. The National Economic and Social Council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement and child dependant allowance into a second tier child income support. Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.I look forward to receiving the Council's report on this matter, which will be of significant assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	510	In assessing means for social assistance purposes account is taken of any cash income the person may have, together with the value of capital and property (except the home). Capital may include the following:—Stocks and shares of every description, which are assessed according to their current market value.—Savings certificates, bonds, national instalment savings, which are assessed according to their current market value.—Money invested in a bank, building society etc.The source of any capital held by a pensioner can and does vary. It can include savings from income while formerly working, savings derived from the sale of property or other assets, savings from occupational or social welfare pensions, gifts, inheritances, accumulated interest or dividends or a combination of these. It would not be possible or practical to distinguish savings derived from a particular source. A better approach is to improve the means testing arrangements for pensioners generally and it was in this context that I introduced major improvements for pensioners in the last two Budgets.For the purposes of old age non-contributory pension, an initial amount of capital has always been disregarded for means test purposes. This amount was £200 up to 1997 and was increased to £2,000 in that year. In October 2000, the disregard was substantially increased to £10,000. In Budget 2005, I was pleased to announce that the amount of capital disregarded for means test purposes for all schemes (except supplementary welfare allowance) was to be increased from EUR12,694.38 to EUR20,000, an increase of over EUR7,300 with effect from June 2006.These new arrangements mean that a single non-contributory pensioner, with no other means, can have capital of up to EUR28,000 and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.In Budget 2006, I announced that I propose to establish, a standardised State (Non-Contributory) Pension, replacing the Old Age Pension and, for recipients aged 66 and over, Blind Pension, Widow/er's Pension, One Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's Allowance and Prisoner's Wife's Allowance. All the schemes in question feature a common means disregard of EUR7.60 per week, which dates back to the 1970s. The means disregard for the new non-contributory pension will be EUR20 per week, an increase of EUR12.40 per week. Over 30,000 pensioners who are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of payment will gain from this change.The increase in the general means disregard, from EUR7.60 to EUR20 per week, specifically benefits those older persons who are in receipt of reduced rate non-contributory pensions because one or both of a couple have income from capital, occupational pensions, foreign social security pensions or from some other source. Furthermore, consequent on the increase in the means disregard to EUR20 per week with effect from the end of September next, a single person, with no other means, will be able to have up to EUR35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This figure is doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.These improvements, along with record increase in the personal and QAA rates of payment, have been of considerable benefit to all pensioners.

Applications for child benefit from EU migrant workers who come to live in Ireland with their families are dealt with under domestic legislation. Entitlement to Child Benefit is based on the applicant satisfying the Habitual Residency condition and the child being ordinarily resident in Ireland.Before Child Benefit is awarded the Department will confirm that the applicant or spouse is in insurable employment in Ireland and that the children are resident in the country. Employment status is confirmed either directly with the employer or via the commencement of employment data held by the Department. The residency of the child is normally confirmed with the school the child is attending. If the child is not yet school age, the parent will be asked to provide confirmation from the family doctor or other nominated professional, of the child's residency in Ireland. Birth certificates for the children are obtained.When the Department is satisfied that the qualifying conditions have been met, the claim is put into payment and a notification is sent to the EU country where the family previously lived to inform them that the family now resides in Ireland and that Child Benefit is being paid here. The authorities in the other member state will then take any necessary action to regularise the customer's payments (if any) in that jurisdiction.Child Benefit customers are informed at the time of their claim, and in ongoing communications, of their obligation to inform the Department of any change in circumstances that may affect their entitlement to benefit. Regular checks are carried out to ensure that those in receipt of the benefit are entitled to it. These include the use of mailshots and follow-up Social Welfare inspector visits as required.Migrant workers who are not EU nationals are dealt with in the same manner as EU nationals but Child Benefit section also confirm that the person is registered with the Garda National Immigration Board (GNIB) as legally resident in the state. EU nationals who come to work in Ireland but whose families remain in their home country have an entitlement to claim Family Benefits in Ireland under EU regulation 1408/71.When an application is received from an EU migrant worker whose family are resident in another member state, the Child Benefit Office contact the relevant authorities in the member state where the workers family reside. As part of the ongoing control process Child Benefit section contacts the other EU country on a regular basis, normally every three months, to confirm the family situation has not changed.In view of the increasing numbers of claims under EU regulations for non resident children, additional control procedures are also being introduced for Child Benefit claims to confirm that only those entitled to the benefit receive it.

In this situation one or both of the payments would be limited to ensure that the relevant household rate of payment would not be exceeded.My department has recently published a Government discussion paper: Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents. Under these proposals for reform of income support arrangements for lone parents and low income families, a new parental allowance for all low income families with children under a specified age would replace both the current one-parent family payment and the qualified adult allowance in social assistance. In these circumstances no limitation would apply where a parental allowance recipient cohabits with a person in receipt of a social assistance payment, e.g. unemployment assistance.Lifting limitation for this limited period of time would have the effect of increasing household income in such situations by up to €58 per week, recognising the higher costs associated with care of young children. It would also assist in addressing the problem of poverty among children in low income families. Any proposal to abolish the limitation rule in full could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of competing priorities.

The report deals specifically with this issue. With regard to the full incorporation of the UN Convention into Irish law the State party report states: The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution review of the Articles in the Constitution dealing with the family was published in 2006. The Review Group recommendation was that a new section should be inserted in Article 41 dealing with the rights of children as follows: All children, irrespective of birth, gender, race or religion, are equal before the law. In all cases, where the welfare of the child so requires, regard shall be had to the best interests of that child.The Committee's recommendations are under consideration by the Government. The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that the careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can be realistically held and the significance of the issues in question. There are no specific plans to hold any referenda during the lifetime of the 29th Dail.It should also be noted that a number of the rights set out in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child are already provided for in the Constitution, either expressly or impliedly. Others are provided for in legislation. Yet other rights were, or are now, provided for in the State on an administrative basis. Important milestones in Ireland with regard to strengthening children's rights include:•Status of Children Act, 1987, which abolished discrimination against non-marital children;•Child Care Act, 1991, deals with children in need of care and protection. The promotion of the welfare of children is the paramount principle underpinning the Act.•Children Act, 1997, which updated the law on guardianship, custody and access and which introduced a comprehensive range of measures to safeguard the interests of child;•Criminal Law Act 1997 Section 12 of the Act abolished the power of a court to impose a sentence of corporal punishment.•Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 Section 24 of the Act abolished the common law rule under which teachers had immunity from criminal liability for physically punishing pupils.•Education Act, 1998 giving a statutory basis to existing arrangements governing the running of schools at primary and post-primary level including making provision, in the interests of the common good, for the education of every person in the State including those who have a disability or who have other special educational needs.•The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 which established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) on a statutory basis as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance and provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.•The Equal Status Act, 2000 provides protection against direct and indirect discrimination outside of employment on nine grounds. These are: gender; marital status; family status; sexual orientation; religion; age; disability; race; membership of the Traveller Community.•The Children Act 2001, which was passed by the Oireachtas in June 2001, constitutes a fundamental revision of existing legislation governing the treatment of children in conflict with the law and non-offending children in need of special care or protection.•Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004 which provides for the education of people with special educational needs.

The provisions of this agreement took the form of the current GMS GP Capitation Contract. This contract is a treatment based contract and gives effect to the statutory requirement to provide free GP medical and surgical services to eligible people which includes people aged 70 and over who are automatically entitled to a medical card. The contract stipulates that the fees paid to the GMS GP's are not made in respect of certain certificates which may be required for example ‘under the Social Welfare Acts or for the purposes of insurance or assurance policies or for the issue of driving licences'. As these non-treatment type services are outside of the GMS GP contract it is a matter between the GP and the person seeking the particular services to agree a fee.While certificates for applications are provided by medical practitioners they are not a medical service and are not considered a core aspect of public health service provision. Requiring such services to be provided within the terms of the GMS GP contract would more than likely lead to a costly counterclaim by GPs which if allowed would not represent appropriate or best use of resources in terms of current health policy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	528	The Deputy will be pleased to note that my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has brought forward a proposal, by way of a Committee Stage amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, to address the problem of assaults and obstruction of personnel engaged in providing emergency services, including problems relating to assaults in hospitals, particularly in Accident and Emergency departments. The Minister's proposal amends section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 which currently provides for offences relating to assault or obstruction of a peace officer, so as to broaden its scope of application and increase the relevant penalties.The Minister's proposal expands the definition of ‘peace officers' to include members of the fire brigade and ambulance personnel. The current definition of ‘peace officers' covers members of the Garda Síochána, Defence Forces or prison officers acting in the execution of their duty. The range of proscribed conduct is also being broadened to cover threats to commit assault. In addition, it is proposed to provide for an offence in relation to threats, assaults, wilful obstruction and impeding of doctors, nurses and other health service workers in or at a hospital.The Minister's proposal, as agreed recently by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, provides for a maximum penalty for assault or threats to commit assault of a fine or 7 years imprisonment or both. The maximum penalty in relation to wilful obstruction or impeding health service workers will be a fine or 6 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding €2,500.

Accordingly, the Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I propose to take Questions Nos. 151, 152, 153 and 178 together.Section 60 (1) of the Health Act, 2004 states that "Each person who, immediately before the establishment day, was an employee of a specified body is, on that day, transferred to and becomes an employee of the Executive." In accordance with section 60 of the Act no redundancies occurred, either of a compulsory or voluntary nature, as a consequence of the recent health reforms.Employment in the Health Boards/ERHA/ Area Boards is superannuated under the Local Government (Superannuation) (Consolidation) Scheme — S.I. 455 of 1998 (LGSS). The superannuation benefits of permanent officers ceasing to hold office are covered under sections 70 and 71 of the Scheme and provide for retirement lump sum and annual pension. Benefits of certain managers, ie those at CEO level, on fixed term contracts are provided for under Section 78 of the Scheme and entitlements include immediate pension, retirement lump sum, 26 weeks severance gratuity, and added years (subject to maximum of ten years). Membership of and the payment of employee contributions to the superannuation scheme is mandatory for all employees.Ten of the twelve former CEOs opted to exit the system (nine on contract and one permanent post holder (who had full service)). In addition, following discussions under the auspices of Mr. Finbarr Flood, acting as Mediator, exit terms were to be supplemented as follows:1. a once-off payment of €10,000 to all CEOs in recognition of the legal duties and functions of the chairpersons and members of the Health Boards having been statutorily assigned to them during the period 1st July 2004 to 31st December 2004,2. a re-training grant of up €10,000 to be paid on basis of vouched expenditure,3. an ex gratia payment equivalent to six months' gross salary.Proposals 2 and 3 applied to those CEOs who requested to leave the HSE by 1st July 2005. These proposals were put forward by the Mediator on the basis of: the uniqueness of the position of the CEOs within the context of the abolition of the Health Boards and the transition to the HSE structures under the Government's health service reform programme, and also the leading role played by the CEOs in facilitating the transfer of accountability and ensuring a safe passage to the new structures.Apart from the CEO posts, three additional posts have been abolished: one contract post (to which Section 78 applied) and two permanent posts. Sections 11 and 66 of the Scheme provide for an "addition to pensionable local service" of a pensionable officer. These sections provide for a qualifying permanent post holder, who ceases to hold office, to be awarded notional added years for superannuation purposes in certain circumstances.The costs of the superannuation benefits payable were administered by the Health Service Executive and I understand that the cost of providing superannuation benefits and ex gratia payments to former Chief Executive Officers was in the region of €3.4 million. The costs of superannuation benefits payable to the additional three persons who had left the HSE was in the region of €0.5 million. I have asked the HSE to notify the Deputies of the exact figure in due course.Finally you may wish to note that in the normal course of events where a post becomes vacant, the decision on whether or not to fill that post is a management decision for the HSE.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	533	I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 158 together.As the Deputy was informed in my response to his question of 9 May 2006, the matter to which he refers is a technical legal matter concerning a claim for redundancy taken to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) and appealed to the High Court by an individual, a former employee of the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB), who had not accepted employment with any of the designated public bodies under the relevant Statutory Instruments on the dissolution of the NRB.As previously advised, the EAT decided on 19 April 2002 that the named individual had been dismissed (within the special meaning of section 21 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967) by reason of redundancy, being therefore entitled to a redundancy payment. The EAT decided that the claim lay against the Minister for Health and Children as representative of the NRB (dissolved). On appeal in July 2003, the High Court found that the EAT had erred in law in determining that the Minister for Health and Children was the representative of the National Rehabilitation Board. Following this decision, the EAT on the 13 February, 2004 made a finding of redundancy in the case of the individual concerned against the NRB (Dissolved), stating that the amount due was payable from the Social Insurance Fund.The cost of the court case and legal expenses to my Department were nil as the case was carried by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. Under the relevant Statutory Instrument on the dissolution of the NRB and the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive is the authority vested to exercise right/discretion in relation to the superannuation issues of the individual concerned. I am advised by the Executive that it has authorised the termination of office of the individual as arising from abolition of office and his pension has been adjusted accordingly.It is important for the Deputy to understand that the EAT did not address the position of other staff in the NRB; it dealt solely in respect of a claim by one individual who did not accept employment with one of the bodies under the SI.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.I have considered the issues raised in the Dail on 18 May 2006 in relation to the dissolution of the national Rehabilitation Board. These matters have been comprehensively dealt with in a number of PQs.The National Disability Authority Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the National Disability Authority and is the legal basis for Statutory Instrument No. 170 of 2000 which transferred certain properties, rights and liabilities of the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB) to the National Disability Authority, FÁS, Comhairle and the Eastern Regional Health Authority; and for S.I. No. 171 of 2000 which dissolved the NRB and provided for the transfer of its 184 staff to these four bodies.Employees of the former National Rehabilitation Board were members of the Local Government Superannuation Scheme. Under that scheme no provision for co-ordination of benefits (ie. between the occupational pension and the contributory Old Age pension) existed for officers. Therefore employees of the National Rehabilitation Board who were Class A PRSI contributors were entitled to a non co-ordinated occupational pension on retirement. The dissolution of the NRB followed on from intensive consultation between NRB management and staff under an independent mediator culminating in an IR agreement within which the existing terms and conditions of staff, including superannuation, PRSI status and incremental dates were protected.Section 28(8) of the National Disability Authority Act, 1999 provided protection of terms and conditions of employment to staff transferring to other agencies from the National Rehabilitation Board. The protection offered at the dissolution of the NRB extends to immediate re-deployment only. The existing pension rights of all former staff transferred to the receiving employer. If staff subsequently changed employment again (e.g. open competition) regardless of whether the posts advertised related to previous functions of the NRB, they took on the employment terms and conditions associated with the new post.As the Deputy is aware, one former employee of the NRB did not accept employment with any of the designated bodies. He took a claim for redundancy to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) which made a finding of redundancy against the NRB (dissolved). He then sought to have his retirement from the NRB treated as arising from abolition of office. I am advised that this was recently granted by the Health Service Executive. It is important for the Deputy to understand that the EAT dealt solely in respect of a claim by one individual who did not accept employment with one of the designated bodies.The question of abolition of office terms, provided for under Articles 11 and 66 of the Local Government Superannuation Scheme, does not arise for the former staff of the NRB where they transferred to one of the designated bodies.As I have said the terms and conditions of employees transferring to other agencies were protected on dissolution of the NRB under the relevant legislation and are now a matter for the current employers. In the event that matters arise which are the responsibility of my Department this will be dealt with in the normal way.

The level of health insurance cover that a person takes out with an insurer is a personal choice. Where a person avails of services not covered by their insurance plan they are liable for any additional costs that arise. It is not open to my Department nor the Health Service Executive to cover such costs. Persons may qualify for tax relief on unreimbursed medical expenses. Any application should be made to the Revenue Commissioners.The accommodation and related care issues outlined in the details supplied relate to services provided to a private patient in a private hospital. Such services are provided on the basis of a private contract between the two parties, the patient as the service user and the hospital as the service provider. The Department of Health and Children has no role in this relationship. Any difficulties experienced should be resolved between the two parties involved. The Deputy may wish to contact the hospital directly in relation to those issues.

To date, the NTPF has arranged treatment for some 42,000 patients. The NTPF purchases procedures for public patients predominantly from private hospitals in Ireland. The Strategy envisaged that the NTPF might also make use of any capacity within public hospitals to arrange treatment for public patients. It was recognised that during the start-up phase of the Fund, the use of public capacity could account for up to 30% of total NTPF activity, once public core service planned activity was not compromised. In June 2005 my Department advised NTPF that use by the Fund of public facilities should be limited to 10% of its total referrals for treatment.My Department has asked the Acting Chief Executive of the Fund to respond to the Deputy in relation to the detailed information requested.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	553	On foot of the recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group, my Department has commenced drafting new pharmacy legislation in two pharmacy Bills. The first Bill is to deal with fitness to practice provisions for pharmacists, the removal of the prohibition — the derogation — on non-Irish graduates being supervising pharmacists in pharmacies less than 3 years old, and a stronger statutory basis for the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI).The second Bill will address the regulation of pharmacy and pharmacy services, including the definition of pharmacy services and of a community pharmacy, enhanced provisions for the inspection of pharmacies, and the provision for regulation of pharmacies for matters such as physical conditions, standards, record keeping and promotional activities. It is also proposed to deal with general provisions relating to community pharmacy contracts for services, as well as the remaining recommendations of the Pharmacy Review Group.The Government accepted the Review Group recommendation that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between prescribing and dispensing and, in regard to multi-GP practices with adjacent pharmacies, that contracted pharmacies and general practices should occupy discrete premises, with separate entrances. I have agreed to consider the potential conflict of interest issues arising from the development of health centres with adjacent contracted pharmacies and this issue will be addressed in the second Bill in the light of that examination.In the interim, my Department has advised the Health Service Executive to take due care in assessing pharmacy contract applications so that any commercial relationship between a pharmacy contractor and a health centre will not affect the proper provision of services as required under clauses 21, 22(3), 22(4) and 23 of the pharmacy contract, dealing with ownership of pharmacies and beneficial interest. I have also written to the Medical Council in relation to this issue.The Deputy will note that the location of services is a land use planning issue and therefore a matter for the relevant planning authority. I am not in a position to dictate the location of privately funded and owned pharmacies or GP practices, nor to restrict the awarding of State pharmacy contracts based on location.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association are pursuing a number of claims in respect of the pay and conditions of nurses. These include claims seeking a reduction in hours from 39 to 35 per week and a pay increase relative to the pay of the social care worker grade (formerly known as child care workers).There is no pay relationship between nurses and social care workers. Social care workers are employed in intellectual disability and childcare services in a variety of community and residential settings including High Support Centres. The pay of nurses was determined by the Public Service Benchmarking Body which established new absolute levels of pay for each benchmarked grade and confirmed that no benchmarked grade may receive a further increase as a consequence of the Body's recommendations as they affect any other grade.In relation to the claim for a 35 hour working week in return for 39 hours pay, it should be noted that a reduction in the hours worked by nurses would have a significant adverse impact on the delivery of care to patients. It is estimated that an additional 4,000 nurses at a cost of €200 million per annum would be required to maintain existing services should this claim be conceded.These two claims from the nursing unions will be heard by the Labour Court on 20 June.

I should also point out that the Government has accepted a recommendation of the Pharmacy Review Group that there should be no beneficial ownership or business interest of any kind between dispensing and prescribing. Pharmacist prescribing would make this recommendation unsustainable.

I have made enquiries with an tArd-Chláraitheoir and the position is as set out below. An tArd-Chláraitheoir maintains a national index of births, which is available in the offices of registrars of births, deaths and marriages around the country. Ideally, to search this index, the applicant should know the date and place of birth, forename of the person concerned and the parents' names. However, it may be possible to locate the relevant entry if only some of these details are available.Where it is established that a birth has not been previously registered, it is possible, under the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004, to effect registration, provided the particulars required by law to be registered are available. In cases where the parents or any other qualified informant with knowledge of the required particulars failed to register a birth within 12 months of the event, the consent of a Superintendent Registrar of births, deaths and marriages is required to effect registration. Where the parents are deceased, or are incapable of acting as qualified informants, or cannot be found, and where no other qualified informant with knowledge of the required particulars can be found, an tArd-Chláraitheoir may cause the birth to be registered on production of adequate evidence of the details of the birth.I understand that the minimum information required to be entered in the birth register is the forename(s) and the surname, date and exact place of birth, the parents' names, or at least the mother's name, and the marital status of the parents.In relation to the birth referred to by the Deputy, it cannot be ascertained from the details supplied which registrar was approached concerning this matter and whether the person concerned had sufficient information to locate an entry in the register or had adequate knowledge of the required particulars to effect a registration. As a first step, I suggest that the person concerned contact any registrar directly in writing, requesting to have the birth registered in accordance with Section 20 of the Civil Registration Act, 2004. A list of registrars' offices and contact details may be found at www.groireland.ie concerning this matter.

There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. Additional funding of €20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to €161 million. The €20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country.The recently published Health (Nursing Homes)(Amendment) Bill 2006 is designed to ensure that the existing subvention scheme for private nursing home care is grounded in primary legislation and to help the HSE to implement the scheme on a standardised basis across the country. In addition, national guidelines on nursing home subvention regulations are currently being developed by the HSE to ensure an even and equitable application of the regulations nationally.

There are currently three rates of subvention payable, i.e. €114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum.The HSE has discretion to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency in a case, for example, where personal funds are exhausted. The application of these provisions in an individual case is a matter for the HSE in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention, subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 2004. The average rate of subvention paid by the HSE generally exceeds the current approved basic rates. The supports paid by the HSE vary from person to person and region to region, depending on prices for example.I wish to advise the Deputy that additional funding of €20 million was provided for the administration of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme in 2006, bringing the total available budget to €161 million. The €20 million is to support more basic nursing home subventions and reduce waiting lists for enhanced subventions: it is also to bring more consistency to subventions support throughout the country.This Government is committed to developing the various community and home support schemes with a view to enabling older people to remain living in their own homes and communities for as long as possible, in line with their expressed wishes. Additional funding for services for older people amounting to €150 million was allocated in the 2006 Budget. This is the largest ever increase in funding for services for older people and, reflecting the new emphasis on home and day care, almost three quarters of this funding is being committed to community care supports including, among other things, Home Care Packages, the Home Help Service, Sheltered Housing and Day/Respite Care.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Section 86 of the Capital Acquisition Tax (CAT) Consolidation Act 2003, which provides an exemption from CAT in relation to certain dwellings, came into effect for gifts or inheritances taken on or after 1 December 1999. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant information available is of the number of claims for this relief which were made in each of the years 2000 to 2005 inclusive. The numbers of such claims were 3 in 2000, 24 in 2001, 13 in 2002, 252 in 2003, 553 in 2004 and 542 in 2005. Data on the values of properties is not captured in the Revenue database by reference to section 86 claims and the information on property values sought by the Deputy, including the values of the ten largest houses, is not accordingly to hand.The relief under Section 86 was introduced by my predecessor in order to reduce the tax burden faced by individuals on receipt of the family home, by gift or inheritance, irrespective of the circumstances of the family relationship. The relief was introduced at the time in response to growing concern on the part of home owners as to the tax consequence of transferring their family home. In the light of the increasing value of family properties and the variety of family relationships in existence it was decided not to restrict the relief by property value or relationship, but to extend the relief to shared-home situations.However, in order to restrict the relief to genuine cases and avoid the relief being used as a means of tax avoidance, a lengthy owner-occupancy condition was included in the legislation. In order to qualify for the relief the beneficiary (i.e. the person who receives the gift/inheritance) must have occupied the dwelling house as his or her only or main residence for a period of at least three years prior to the gift or inheritance and must continue to own and reside in it for a period of six years after the date of the gift or inheritance. These conditions of ownership and residence upon inheritance may be waived where the beneficiary requires long-term medical care in a hospital, nursing home or convalescent home. In addition, in order to avail of the relief, the beneficiary must not have an interest in any other property at the time of inheritance. I am confident that these conditions ensure that only genuine cases qualify for the relief.

Contracts will only be entered into when all terms have been agreed and legal documentation is to the satisfaction of the Chief State Solicitor. The building, when built will accommodate 305 Department of Education staff and will have sufficient scope to cater for some 10% future expansion if required.While there has been some examination by the Department of Education, of the feasibility of relocating a number of the posts scheduled to decentralise to temporary accommodation in Mullingar in advance of the main move, no decision has been taken by the Department on this matter to date. At this point in time, a target date of first quarter 2009 is in place for the completion of the construction of the accommodation in Mullingar. This timetable is contingent on a successful outcome to the tender competition which will follow on the call for expressions of interest, on planning permission being obtained and on no delays being experienced during the architectural planning and construction stages.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the most recent estimated cost of making the main personal tax credits refundable when they are unused is broadly in the region of €2.1 billion annually. The main category of refund would relate to the employee credit where the annual cost of refunding the unused portion of the credit to income earners with insufficient income to fully absorb it would amount to €1.1 billion approximately. The next categories of refund in order of scale would be the basic personal credit — single, married and widowed — costing €1 billion approximately.The estimate of €2.1 billion relates only to the cost of extending refundable tax credits to all those on Revenue's tax files. If a refundable tax credit system were to be introduced, one would have to consider those who are not on the tax files, for example, those who are of employable age but not working, including those in social welfare. This would increase the cost significantly.Apart from the issue of cost, there would be a range of other policy and practical difficulties arising in introducing such a system. I have no plans to introduce refundable tax credits at the present time.

The design of the bridge has yet to be completed and the estimated cost will not be available until the design is finalised. A Planning Procedure is required and will be completed under Part 9 of the Planning Regulations.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	614	There are no allowances payable in the civil service or the Defence Forces for the provision of a service through Irish. In the education sector there are two allowances paid to teachers in first and second-level schools who provide a service through Irish. There is an allowance for teaching through Irish paid to teachers in Gaelscoileanna and Scoileanna lán Gaeilge of €1,472 per annum (as at 1 December 2005). A second allowance of €2,849 per annum (as at 1 December 2005) is payable to teachers in the Gaeltacht. Teachers can only receive one of these allowances. The allowances are not paid to other education staff.Certain local authority officers receive a Gaeltacht allowance under regulations set out in Statutory Instrument 221 of 1966. Under these regulations a local authority may pay an office holder additional remuneration, not exceeding 7.5% of the annual basic salary of the office holder, where her/his duties are performed mainly or entirely in the Gaeltacht and the local authority is satisfied that s/he possesses a sufficient knowledge of the Irish language to enable her or him to perform the duties of the office competently through Irish. The same arrangements apply in the health service as in local authorities.In the Garda Síochána, a Gaeltacht allowance equal to 7.5% of basic pay is payable to members up to and including Chief Superintendent. The allowance is payable only in areas where Irish is the general medium of speech and where all the members of the Force are proficient in Irish and are required to perform their duties through Irish. I understand that the Gaeltacht allowance payable to the Garda Síochána is the subject of a separate question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Details of the amounts paid out in the last three years and the numbers in receipt of the aforementioned allowances are not readily available. If the Deputy requires this information I suggest that he direct questions to the relevant Ministers.

The Local Authorities have employed consultants to design the measures outlined in the River Tolka Flooding Study.It is the understanding of the Commissioners of Public Works that a number of proposals have been put forward by the consultants to the Local Authorities to alleviate the flood risk in this particular area, one of which is to undertake some widening of the channel. The proposals will be considered by the Local Authorities, and will also be the subject of discussions with the landowners concerned and the Office of Public Works, and a preferred option will be chosen. This preferred option will be taken forward by Fingal County Council and exhibited under the Planning and Development Regulations, and will contain an environmental appraisal of any proposed works.

It is understood from contact with the Deputy's constituency office that the person concerned requires details of earnings and tax deducted while working for the company concerned. A statement of earnings for 2004 and 2005 in respect of the taxpayer's former employment has issued to her dated 15 June 2006.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	617	Stamp duty is a tax on certain documents, generally legal documents, used in transferring property or in creating rights for the parties concerned. The stamp duty code generally does not provide exemptions based on an individual's particular circumstances and introducing such a provision would represent a significant departure from normal stamp duty rules. However, I have been advised by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government that a scheme of disabled persons grants is operated by local authorities with capital provision from that Department. These grants are designed to meet the needs of persons who are either physically handicapped or are suffering from severe mental handicap or severe mental illness. Where a new dwelling is being bought or built a maximum grant of €12,700 is payable. In the case of adaptation of an existing dwelling, 90% of the approved cost of the works is available up to an effective maximum grant of €20,320. Full details of the scheme and the conditions applicable are available from the local authority in whose area the dwelling is situated.I would point out that there is no stamp duty on the purchase of new residential property for owner-occupiers where the dwelling is not greater than 125 square metres and complies with certain conditions in relation to building standards. If the property is over 125 square metres, stamp duty is charged on the site value or one quarter of the total value of the property (whichever is the greater).Stamp duty is a significant contributor to the Exchequer and stamp duty receipts allow for a broader tax base than would otherwise be possible. These receipts form an important element of State revenues which permits Government spending on services such as health and education.

The selection of staff for the advance office will in the first instance focus on surplus Department of Agriculture staff in the region who have expressed a preference for decentralisation to Claremorris through the Central Applications Facility (CAF). There are some 170 plus applicants on CAF for Claremorris of which 30 or more are based in Dublin.

A total of 171 first preference priority applications were received on the Central Applications Facility (CAF) for the 378 posts in Cavan. Of these, 109 were from people currently working in Dublin. I have recently announced my decision to relocate a small advance party of decentralising civil servants to temporary accommodation in Cavan this August.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	624	The Government's Decentralisation Programme, announced in December 2003, included proposals to relocate the Central Fisheries Board (CFB), an Agency of my Department, to Carrick-on-Shannon. This proposal involved the decentralisation of the 62 Dublin-based posts in the Board. The Programme also included proposals to decentralise part of the Department of Social and Family Affairs (220 posts) to Carrick-on-Shannon.The latest information my Department has received from the Public Appointments Service, based on the decentralisation Central Applications Facility (CAF), is that 42 first choice expressions of interest have been received for the CFB posts of which 18 are from persons working in Dublin.My Department and the CFB have liaised closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW) on the issue of accommodation. OPW has advised that while they have secured an accommodation solution for the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the availability of suitable sites and property in the town for the CFB remains a significant challenge. In this regard, the Decentralisation Implementation Group (DIG) has not yet set out a definitive timetable for the relocation of the Board.In addition, following a major review of the inland fisheries sector, the Government has decided that a fundamental restructuring of the sector is required. This will involve the establishment of a new National Inland Fisheries Authority (NIFA), which will subsume the executive functions of the existing central and regional fisheries boards. The Government's decentralisation policy will apply to the location of the NIFA's headquarters in the same way that it applies to all other public sector bodies.

The most recent call for proposals has now closed and I expect to launch further schemes of this nature shortly.My Department's website, www.broadband.gov.ie, gives full details of broadband availability in all areas, including ADSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless. The website also lists prices of the various service levels on offer and contact details for each service provider.

Rehabilitation of Gortmore tailings pond forms part of that project. North Tipperary County Council has agreed to undertake the rehabilitation works, operating as an agent on behalf of my Department.It is important that appropriate procedures and processes are followed for the procurement of services of this kind and I am pleased to inform the Deputy that consultants have now been selected.

The functions of the consultants will be to draw up detailed design plans, prepare tender documents, oversee the works, report on progress etc.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The primary responsibility for the development of the post office network rests with An Post. The current level of automated coverage is considered by An Post to be extremely comprehensive by any objective standard and this level of coverage makes it difficult to justify on either customer-service or economic grounds the extension of automation to all offices, regardless of their location or business volumes.Nevertheless, I have asked An Post to undertake a pilot project to automate a selected number of non-automated offices to gauge the effect on new business. Ten post offices have been automated as part of this project and a marketing campaign is under way in the localities where the pilot projects are being undertaken to support the initiative. Upon completion of the pilot, An Post will assess and evaluate the results of the project and the impact of automation on business.With regard to the provision of internet availability to the public, there are no plans by An Post, at this point, to provide this service to the public through the rural post office network. However, I would like to point out that, with the roll out of eGovernment services, the automated element of the post office network is ideally placed to capitalise on opportunities arising in this space, especially in the area of ePayments.A core objective for An Post continues to be the retention of access to post office services in as many locations as possible, in the manner which best meets customer needs, whether services are provided via post offices, postal agencies or the postpoint network.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The development and continued viability of An Post and the post office network is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post.This Government and the Board of An Post are committed to the objective of ensuring the continuation of a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network as set out in the Programme for Government. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size.I have asked the company to ensure that any strategy for the development of the company should ensure the long term viability of the post office network and in this light, An Post is currently working on a financial services initiative which could see the development and expansion of the range of financial services that it can deliver through its network of post offices.Following recent Government approval the board and management of An Post have now commenced exclusive negotiations with the company's preferred partner, Fortis, to expand the range of retail financial services available through the post office network with a view to increasing the levels of post office business. If the initiative proves to be successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the enhanced viability of the network.

The CFCA will coordinate fisheries control and inspection activities by Member States through the establishment of Joint Deployment Plans agreed in consultation with the Member States concerned, where a specific monitoring programme has been agreed at EU level and on the basis of control resources made available to it by Member States. The Member States remain responsible for the implementation and enforcement of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The establishment of the Irish Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority will not change the relationship between the Irish control authorities and the CFCA.Since then, Council Regulation work has been progressing on the development of the CFCA. An administrative board has been established comprising representatives of the Commission and of each Member State and the candidate countries of Romania and Bulgaria. At a meeting of the administrative board in Vigo last week, Mr. Harm Koster was appointed as Executive Director of the CFCA. Implementing rules under the CFP governing inspections and the reporting of infringements were agreed in May 2006. The CFCA is to commence its operations in Brussels before moving to Vigo in early 2008.

The strategy is designed to underpin the development of the marine sector for the coming years and aims to ensure that Ireland fully maximises the economic, social and environmental contribution of its marine resources.It is my intention to bring the report to Government in the near future and to have it published as soon as possible thereafter. As the Deputy will appreciate, until such time as the report is presented to Government, I am not in a position to comment further.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	636	The central strategic goal of the new NDP 2007- 2013 must be to ensure the long term economic, social and environmental sustainability of the seafood industry as a whole, thus maintaining the value of its activity to the coastal and rural communities who rely upon it, and to the economy as a whole.With regard to future priorities for aquaculture under the NDP 2007- 2013, given that Ireland is no longer a low cost economy, constant improvement in efficiency is required of this sector for it to remain competitive. Key to achieving this will be the application of technological innovation to further develop environmentally sustainable techniques, including organic farming, and achieve successful diversification into new species, while ensuring the highest international quality standards are met.Detailed priorities for aquaculture will be defined as part of the development of the overall programme for investment in the seafood sector under the new NDP, taking into account the final form of the European Fisheries Fund, which was agreed at the EU Fisheries Council on 19 June. In order to inform this process, I have proposed plans for the development of a comprehensive strategy to take the sector forward and inform funding priorities for the 2007-2013 period. The development of this strategy will involve a number of key elements including, the appointment of an independent leader of the strategy team, and the holding of regional meetings to hear views from all parts of the sector. There will also be a forum which will bring together industry representatives, key sectoral players and experts from the food and related sectors.

In addition sanction is in place for 45 additional posts and a significant recruitment drive is taking place at present. The Authority will be located in Clonakilty, County Cork, as will the seafood functions of my Department which are relocating there as part of the Government's decentralisation plans. The budget for the new Authority has yet to be settled.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	638	Ireland has been a firm supporter of the right to self-determination of the people of the Western Sahara, and the Government remains firmly committed to this principle.At the Fisheries Council in May 2006 which ratified the agreement, Ireland made the following statement to the Council setting down its position on the Fisheries agreement in relation to the Western Sahara situation: Ireland supports the conclusion of the Fisheries partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on the basis that it does not prejudice the long-standing position of the EU on the status of the Western Sahara. The EU continues to support the efforts of the UN Secretary General to encourage a negotiated solution which will allow the people of the Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination. Ireland emphasises the importance of the future dialogue within the EU-Morocco Joint Committee foreseen under this agreement. It is essential that the Joint Committee make use of all instruments under the Agreement to ensure that the Agreement is implemented to the benefit of all the people concerned and in accordance with the principles of international law. Under the terms of the Regulation, Ireland was allocated 2,500 tonnes of pelagic fish per annum. The conditions in place for Irish fishing boats will be the same as will apply to all EU fishing boats under the terms of the agreement.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	640	The telecommunications sectors in both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland are fully liberalised but regulated, by ComReg in the Republic and by OFCOM in Northern Ireland. While private sector broadband infrastructure is currently more extensive in Northern Ireland and the percentage of broadband subscribers is higher, the gap continues to narrow. My Department and Northern Ireland's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment are jointly implementing the €7.5 million, EU supported, INTERREG IIIa initiative, which is funding a number of projects to improve broadband connectivity in border areas.Broadband subscriber numbers have increased hugely in the last year. Almost 140,000 new broadband subscribers were added in 2005, a growth rate of 103% in 2005. This compares to 100,000 new broadband subscribers in 2004. The latest ComReg quarterly report states there are 270,700 broadband subscribers as of end-2005. This is equivalent to 6.6% of the population. ComReg estimate that there are 320,000 subscribers to the end of the first quarter of 2006.Home Internet penetration figures currently stand at 18.7% of households. DSL dominates the Irish broadband market (75% market share). However, Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) and cable are growing very strongly, albeit from a small base.The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high-speed, open-access Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) in 120 towns and cities nationwide. Phase One of this Programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.This Programme has been extended to over 90 towns in various locations nationwide. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the County and Group Broadband Scheme. The scheme is technology-neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, over 150 projects have been approved for funding under this Programme.Furthermore, a joint industry/Government fund of €18 million has been established for the Broadband for Schools Programme, which should provide every school in the country with broadband in 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning, and my Department's wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country. The installation phase is now almost complete, with over 90% of all schools broadband enabled.Today there are 68 broadband providers, a mixture of DSL, fixed wireless, satellite and cable, offering almost 300 different types of broadband products. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity, and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	641	Garnish Pier is owned by Cork County Council and responsibility for its repair and maintenance rests with the local authority in the first instance. Cork County Council submitted a proposal to the Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources for works at Garnish Pier at an estimated cost of €750,000. Last year, under the Small Fishery Harbours Programme, the Department allocated funding of €45,000 to Cork County Council towards pier improvement works at Garnish Pier costing a total of €60,000.Garnish Pier is in an area coming within the scope of the CLÁR Programme. However, the current project cannot be considered for funding under the coastal development measure of that Programme, which is co-funded between the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and this Department. One of the criteria for grant aid under this scheme is that only projects costing up to a maximum of €200,000 per project are funded.There was no funding available from the Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources in 2006 for this project. The question of providing funding in the post 2006 period will be considered in the context of the amount of the funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	642	Scientific advice indicates that the eel stock is highly depleted, not only in Ireland but worldwide. Indeed the entire European stock of eel is so seriously depleted that the EU Commission is proposing to introduce a regulation designed to assist in stock recovery. I understand that the life cycle of the eel is such that stock recovery will take several years. The EU regulation, as drafted, will require the preparation of management plans for the recovery of eels in river basin districts as defined under the water framework directive. The Commission proposal also includes emergency measures to be applied, which currently include at least a 50% reduction in exploitation.The key objective of each management plan will be to allow a minimum of 40% escapement, as would apply in pristine conditions, of adult eel from rivers to the sea to allow for spawning. The plan will set out the mechanisms by which this objective will be achieved and the methods to be employed to monitor their implementation. The Commission has proposed that under the current timescale, plans should be submitted by the end of 2006 and operational, subject to approval in the scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries, by July 2007.The methods of application and extent of the prohibition on fishing effort is the subject of on-going debate among member states. In the meantime, the options for implementation of the draft regulation are under consideration by a national working group of officials, even while clarification from the Commission on technical matters is awaited. The fisheries boards will communicate with the industry and keep it informed .
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	643	Ireland takes a consistently strong position on Burma, including in the European Union framework and at the United Nations. Together with our EU partners, we avail of all opportunities to condemn the abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Burma and deplore the lack of progress towards democracy.The recent visit by Mr. Gambari, the UN Under-Secretary-General, to Burma from 18-20 May, was the first high-level visit to that country by a UN representative in more than two years. I welcome the fact that he was able to meet with the most senior Burmese leaders as well as with Aung San Suu Kyi and representatives of her party, the National League for Democracy, during the visit. I also welcome the agreement by the Burmese government that the UN should play a role in promoting common ground between the government and the National League for Democracy so that the National Convention, which is due to resume its work in October, can proceed in a more inclusive way. I would appeal to the Burmese authorities to live up to their undertakings in this regard.While welcoming the above developments, I remain very concerned about the situation. On 26 May, the EU issued a statement which noted with deep concern that the process of democratisation in Burma had recently suffered a worrying setback as the Burmese government stepped up its pressure against ethnic groups and the two main political parties. The statement noted that these actions contradict the professed intention to establish a genuine democratic nation. The statement also urged the Burmese government to accelerate the democratisation process, a process which should engage all political and ethnic forces in the country in a genuine dialogue and lead to the speedy completion of a constitution under civilian rule, which commands popular support and promotes peaceful and sustainable development.I remain deeply concerned that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been detained continuously for three years without charge and, once more, urge the Burmese government to restore fully her freedom and civil liberties. UN USG Gambari's visit generated high hopes that her detention under house arrest, which was up for renewal a few days after he left Burma, might not be renewed by the authorities. This did not happen. On 27 May, the EU issued a further statement which deeply regretted the decision of the Burmese government to extend the house arrest of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and deplored the fact that international appeals, including that of the EU, had once again gone unheard. It said that this decision will be seen as yet another sign that the Burmese government is unwilling to compromise and move in the direction of an all-inclusive democracy.I will continue to raise concerns about Burma on all possible occasions and to call on the Burmese government to assume its responsibilities towards its people and to allow the fullest possible UN involvement in a genuine process of democratisation and reconciliation. I am also strongly supportive of the fullest possible involvement by the UN Secretary-General, and his representatives, in working with the Burmese authorities on a genuine process of democratisation and reconciliation and in responding to the humanitarian needs of the long-suffering Burmese people.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	644	The Government regrets the recent deaths at Guantánamo Bay. While the full circumstances surrounding the deaths remain unclear the fact that three detainees committed suicide is deeply troubling. I welcome the fact that the US government has promised a full review of procedures at the camp and that it has been agreed that the International Committee of the Red Cross may shortly undertake another visit to the camp.The Government has raised the issue of the detainees in Guantánamo Bay with the US Authorities on numerous occasions and we have always made it clear that we believe that those detained in Guantánamo must be treated in accordance with the requirements of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. This position is shared by the EU as a whole and at the meeting of EU Foreign Ministers that I attended in Luxembourg on 12 June, there was general consensus that Guantánamo should be closed as soon as possible. This is also the view of the UN Secretary General.As I have said previously, I fully endorse the UN Secretary General's view that those held in Guantánamo Bay should either be charged or released, and that the US should close this facility.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The new Iraqi national unity Government was approved by Parliament on 20 May 2006, and the outstanding positions of Defence, the Interior and National Security were filled on 8 June. Iraq now has a sovereign and democratic Parliament and Government, mandated for four years. This is a very significant step in the rebuilding of a democratic Iraq following years of brutal dictatorship.In order to underline the strong support of the European Union for the new Government, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari was invited to meet with EU Foreign Ministers, including myself, during the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Luxembourg on 12 June. We had a good exchange of views on the situation in Iraq and on the prospects for the development of a new relationship between Iraq and the EU. The European Council, on 16 June, emphasised the readiness of the EU to renew its engagement with the Government and people of Iraq and looked forward to rapid and early political dialogue with the new Government.The Government and our EU partners recognise the serious challenges facing the new national unity Government, and are committed to assisting it in its efforts to build security and prosperity for the Iraqi people. Our assistance will be based on the priorities established by the Iraqi Government. The recent opening of an office of the European Commission in Baghdad will enhance this cooperation.Since 2003, the EU has provided over €700 million in Community support for the reconstruction of Iraq. In the coming year, the Union's contribution will include support for the national reconciliation and constitutional review process, in close cooperation with the UN. The EU will also continue its efforts to promote the rule of law and respect for human rights, including through the Integrated Rule of Law Mission for Iraq. I also expect that the EU will be in a position to launch the negotiation of a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with the new Iraqi Government in the near future.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	646	Maintaining and strengthening links with Irish communities abroad is a key priority of my Department. Officials in our diplomatic missions and in the Irish Abroad Unit are very active in this regard and work closely with Irish community organisations across a wide range of issues.The Government's firm commitment to enhance support for our communities abroad is reflected in the very substantial level of funding now available for emigrant services. This year, the unprecedented amount of €12 million has been secured for this purpose. This amount follows on other large increases in recent years, so that funding is now 12 times the sum that was available when this Government came to office in 1997.While the primary emphasis of Government funding continues to be to support frontline welfare services, I am pleased that the additional funding has also made it possible to support a number of capital projects as well as initiatives which foster a greater sense of community.Supporting the Irish community in Britain, in particular our older emigrants and those at risk of social exclusion, is an area of great importance. In recognition of this, I expect that some 80% of this year's overall allocation will be disbursed to groups there. Grant applications are currently under consideration and I look forward to making an announcement shortly.Another priority area is that of the undocumented Irish in the United States. Over the St. Patrick's Day period, the Taoiseach and I availed fully of our valuable meetings with President Bush and Members of Congress to make known our strong support for measures that would enable the undocumented to regularise their status. I returned to Washington DC on 24 May to meet again with key legislators so as to reiterate the importance that we attach to this issue. The Ambassador and our officials in the US continue to raise the Government's views in their on-going contacts with key figures.During my visit to Washington in May, I was happy to meet again with representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform (ILIR). This group is proving most effective and the Government has been happy to provide it with financial support. I also greatly appreciate the important work of the Irish welfare and advisory organisations in the US which assist our community there.While most funding is directed to organisations abroad, I was happy to provide financial support recently totalling €200,000 to three organisations based in Ireland that are engaged in activities of benefit to Irish people abroad. The organisations in question are Emigrant Advice, the Safe Home Programme and the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas.Another positive development has been the recent decision of the Government to widen the eligibility criteria of the Centenarian Bounty scheme such that all Irish citizens born in the island of Ireland who have reached 100 years of age, wherever they may reside, are now eligible to apply for the Bounty.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	647	Presidential and parliamentary elections are now scheduled to take place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) on 30 July 2006. These will be the first multi-party elections in the DRC in over 40 years. A total of 33 candidates will contest the presidency while some 260 political parties and over 9,300 candidates will compete for the 500 legislative seats in the new parliament. Over 25 million people out of an estimated potential electorate of 28 million have registered to vote.Successfully conducted elections are absolutely critical to the consolidation of peace and security in the DRC and in the Great Lakes Region as a whole. The international community, including Ireland and its EU partners, is investing heavily in ensuring that the forthcoming elections are successful, given the major organisational challenge they represent for a country the size of western Europe with extremely poor basic infrastructure and ongoing security problems. The EU and its Member States alone are contributing some €235 million towards the overall cost of the elections which are estimated at well over $300 million. The EU will also deploy a 250-strong electoral observation mission to monitor the elections.Nationally, Ireland is also actively supporting the electoral process in the DRC. I was pleased to announce an initial contribution of €500,000 to the UNDP Trust Fund established to meet the costs of the elections, following my meeting last September with the Foreign Minister of the DRC, Mr. Raymond Ramazani Baya, en marge of the UN General Assembly. A further contribution of €800,000 was announced by my Department last month in support of the South African Independent Electoral Commission which is assisting in the logistical organisation and oversight of the elections. The Government has also decided to provide up to ten Permanent Defence Force personnel to serve with the EUFOR RDC mission which the EU is deploying, at UN request, to provide support, if required, to the UN MONUC peace-keeping mission during the electoral period. Ireland also provides three members of the PDF who serve with MONUC while the Government has also contributed over €11 million for emergency and recovery activities in the DRC since 2002, almost €5 million of which has been provided to date in 2006.Ireland's diplomatic relations with the DRC are handled through our Embassy in South Africa. Officers from the Embassy visit and regularly report on political developments in the DRC, including election preparations and the difficult security situation in eastern DRC, as well as the important role being played by South Africa in support of successful completion of the transition process in the DRC. My Department also maintains regular contact with representatives of the Congolese community based in Ireland.

Ireland has no representation in Belarus, but the Embassy in Moscow is accredited to that country. The vast majority of visas for Belorussian citizens are, as a result, issued by our Moscow Embassy. Figures for the numbers of visas issued to Belorussian citizens by the Embassy in Moscow are available only from 2003. Following are the available statistics: Visas Issued by the Embassy in Moscow for Belorussian citizens:740 visas were approved in 2003322 in 2004427 in 20051,201 in 2006 (up to 31 May).As a child protection measure, the visa-free status of children who are victims of the Chernobyl disaster was recently lifted and this accounts for the large rise in the numbers issued by the Embassy in Moscow in 2006. In addition to the above, some 89 visas were issued in 2005 by the Visa Office in Dublin for Belorussian citizens, and 56 up to 31 May this year.

In view of this, most of the Government's emigrant services funding is directed to organisations in Britain that are engaged in a wide range of activities of benefit to our community there.In 2004, the initial allocation to groups in Britain was €3.57 million. However, during that year additional resources were secured for emigrant services and the final amount distributed to groups in Britain reached €4.33 million. Details of the grants approved and paid out in that year are set out in the table.In 2005, a further substantial increase in funding for emigrant services was secured. I was happy to approve grants to groups in Britain totalling €7.06 million, an increase of 63% on the previous year. Details of these grant payments are also set out. While the primary area of funding was to support frontline welfare services, additional funding made it possible to also support a number of projects which assist our community in Britain in their wish to maintain and to develop Irish community networks.This year, €12 million is available for emigrant services worldwide. This figure represents an increase of 45% on 2005 and is twelve-times greater than the 1997 allocation. I expect that some 80% of this will be disbursed in grants to groups in Britain during the course of the year. Grant applications are currently under consideration and I look forward to making an announcement shortly.LocationActivities of organisation€Acton Homeless Concern, North London67,560LondonWelfareAge Concern Ealing51,600LondonWelfareAge Concern Hackney Borough26,160LondonWelfareAisling Return to Ireland Project49,980LondonWelfareArlington Action Group36,420LondonWelfareBirmingham Irish Community Forum40,500BirminghamWelfareBlackfriars Advice Centre47,580LondonWelfareBrent Irish Advisory Service120,000LondonWelfareBroadway — Day Centre & Night Shelter London44,800LondonWelfareCairde na nGael — Newham & District Friends of Ireland61,920LondonWelfareCamden Elderly Irish Networks66,660LondonWelfareCARA Irish Housing Association27,120LondonWelfareCoventry Irish Society93,240CoventryWelfareCricklewood Homeless Concern215,560LondonWelfareFederated Irish Association, Nottingham & Notts (FIANN)43,680NottinghamCommunity Networks & Heritage/CulturalFederation of Irish Societies403,080London2nd Tier organisation (supports frontline services)Finsbury Park Street Drinkers Initiative39,600LondonWelfareGAA London Schools Project38,400LondonSportGloucester Emergency Accommodation Resource15,600GloucesterWelfareHaringey Irish Cultural &Community Care Centre99,420LondonWelfareImmigrant Counselling & Psychotherapy (ICAP)110,400LondonWelfareIrish Centre Housing / Job Powerhouse39,120LondonWelfareIrish Charitable Trust/ ISAS Hammersmith124,000LondonWelfareIrish Commission for Prisoners Overseas132,000LondonWelfareIrish Community Care Manchester128,320ManchesterWelfareIrish Community Care Merseyside130,620LiverpoolWelfareIrish Democratic League clubs Lancashire and Yorkshire45,000Lancashire and YorkshireCommunity Networks & Heritage/CulturalIrish in Greenwich Project111,120LondonWelfareIrish Travellers Movement56,580LondonWelfareIrish Welfare and Information Centre Birmingham181,620BirminghamWelfareKilburn Irish Pensioners Club3,600LondonWelfareLeeds Irish Health and Homes100,440LeedsWelfareLeicester Irish Forum25,200LeicesterWelfareLewisham Irish Community Centre35,640LondonWelfare & Heritage/CulturalLondon Gypsy and Traveller Unit77,400LondonWelfareLondon Irish Centre Charity Camden291,580LondonWelfare & Heritage/CulturalLondon Irish Elders Forum50,400LondonWelfareLondon Irish Women’s Centre104,760LondonWelfareLuton Irish Forum42,180LutonWelfareNew Horizon Youth Centre38,400LondonWelfareNOAH Enterprise (Luton Day Centre for the Homeless)67,320LutonWelfareNorthampton Irish Support Group49,980NorthamptonWelfareRehabCare, Coventry65,760CoventryWelfareSafe Home Programme Ltd.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	650	The EU-Morocco Fisheries Partnership Agreement was adopted by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 22 May 2006. When Morocco has completed its ratification procedures, the Agreement will come into force following an exchange of notifications by both sides.The Agreement states that it applies to the waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco. As the Deputy will be aware, Morocco regards the Western Sahara and its waters as a part of its territory. However, Ireland and our EU partners do not recognise Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara. The Government strongly supports the right to self-determination of the people of the territory.The European Commission is responsible for the negotiation of such agreements with third countries. They are adopted by the Council by Qualified Majority Vote. In 2005, the Council approved the Commission's mandate for the negotiations with Morocco. At that time, Ireland raised concerns about possible implications for the overall issue of the status of the Western Sahara and regarding the exploitation of the resources of the Saharawi people. The Commission undertook to ensure that the Agreement would not compromise the issue of status, and would reflect exactly the terms in relation to territorial extent contained in previous Fisheries Agreements between the EU and Morocco.During consideration by the Council of the draft Agreement negotiated by the Commission, Ireland again focused on these issues. The Government proposed that, in order to clarify the situation beyond question, the EU might adopt a Declaration which would accompany the Agreement. However, it emerged that there was a qualified majority of Member States in favour of approving the Agreement without an EU Declaration.At the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 22 May, Ireland agreed to the adoption of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, which is regarded as very important by the European fishing industry, and made a National Statement in relation to the Western Sahara. The full text of the Statement is as follows:Ireland supports the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco on the basis that it does not prejudice the long-standing position of the EU on the status of the Western Sahara. The EU continues to support the efforts of the UN Secretary General to encourage a negotiated solution which will allow the people of the Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination. Ireland emphasises the importance of the future dialogue within the EU-Morocco Joint Committee foreseen under this agreement. It is essential that the Joint Committee make use of all instruments under the Agreement to ensure that the Agreement is implemented to the benefit of all the people concerned and in accordance with the principles of international law.

On the basis of my and my Department's discussions with the US authorities, I have no reason to believe that this was other than an isolated incident which arose from an administrative error. At my meeting with him on 12 June, the US Ambassador conveyed his deep regret for the breach of procedures, and confirmed his authorities' determination that the use of Irish airspace and airports by the US be completely transparent and in conformity with Irish law and the wishes of the Government.I am awaiting a written report from the US Embassy. In addition, to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent any recurrence of this incident, we are engaging in further discussion with the US authorities on arrangements for notification and information sharing, and the strengthening of verification procedures as necessary.As I have previously emphasised, this incident is quite distinct from the much more serious question of extraordinary rendition, and I remain confident of the continuing validity and weight of the clear assurances repeatedly given to us by the US authorities in that context.

Since those restrictions were lifted, people who were affected have been able to avail of Irish passport facilities in the same way as Irish citizens generally.The Department has been unable to locate a record of any individual passport having been withdrawn from an Irish citizen in the then Rhodesia during that period. However, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will be happy to have the position checked out further.

This provides for the establishment of a fund which is derived from the revenues accruing to the Exchequer from the excise duty collected as duty on off-course betting. This provides for a guaranteed level of funding each year up to an aggregate total for horse and greyhound racing which is independent of the amount provided for sport in the annual estimates process.The development of professional football is a matter for the Eircom league and the FAI itself and while over €9 million has been provided by the Irish Sport Council in grants to the FAI since 1999, much of this has been aimed at supporting programmes aimed at increasing participation in football by young people.My Department has provided grants directly to Eircom league clubs under the sports capital programme to assist with improvements to league grounds. In the period 1998 to 2002, over €11.4 million has been allocated in funding to 17 Eircom league clubs of which about €10million of this amount has been paid out to date. Following the advent of club licensing in 2004, which aims to improve standards across all aspects of the Eircom league, I announced further funding in 2005 of €5.275 million in respect of 16 Eircom league clubs.Overall my Department has allocated over €84 million to soccer clubs under the sports capital programme since 1998 which underlines my commitment to the development of facilities for soccer in Ireland at all levels.

All applications received before the deadline, including one from the organisation in question were evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. I announced details of the provisional grant allocations for local projects on 6 June last.The application referred to by the Deputy was successful this year and the club were granted a provisional allocation, subject to the terms and conditions of the programme, of €100,000 towards their project. A letter advising the organisation of this allocation, together with details of how the grant may be drawn down, will issue in the near future.

These are, in order of progress, Feasibility Study/Preliminary Report, Contract Documents, Tender and Construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works (OPW), evaluate each stage and prior approval is required before local authorities can proceed from one stage to the next. Grant aid is formally allocated when the tender for the project is approved.I approved the Preliminary Report for the replacement public pool in Castlebar in April 2005, thus allowing Mayo County Council to prepare Contract Documents for the project. These documents are awaited. It should be noted that progress of projects under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme is largely determined, not by my Department, but by the speed at which individual Local Authorities progress their projects.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	660	The Deputy will be aware of the background to this matter from replies on 28 September 2005, 25 January and 16 February 2006. Limited inspections of meat plants are continuing to be undertaken; fourteen plants have been visited since January 2006 and no breaches of the legislation requiring prosecution were found. However, a full programme of inspections of weighing equipment in meat processing plants will not be possible until an industrial relations issue relating to the hiring of private hauliers for the conveyance and lifting of test equipment is resolved.A Labour Relations Commission hearing on 27 March 2006 was unsuccessful in resolving the matter and further negotiations are ongoing between management and staff representatives. An external facilitator has been engaged but due to the non-availability of some of the parties to the negotiation over the coming weeks the facilitation process is not expected to take place for a number of weeks. Failing resolution at that stage, the matter will be referred back for hearing by the Labour Relations Commission.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	661	Community Employment is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed term basis. CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment. The programme is managed within this context and with consideration to the needs of participants and the community and the demand for CE resources from those Organisations delivering services.On 10 November, 2004, following a review of FÁS Employment Schemes (Community Employment, Job Initiative and Social Economy Programmes), I announced that Community Employment places supporting the delivery of health services, including those for people with disabilities would continue to be ring-fenced.Decisions regarding the provision of core funding for the health services generally are a matter for the Minister for Health and Children.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	662	The total amount of grants paid by Enterprise Ireland and its predecessors to the company in question over the period 1995-2005 was €424,065. In addition, the company received payments of €824,324 under the FEOGA Programme.The company has not returned any grant aid to Enterprise Ireland. Discussions concerning grant aid to the plant at Rooskey, County Roscommon are still continuing. Progress is being made on the negotiations and I understand that a conclusion will be reached shortly. This will take account of a very significant investment which is being undertaken by the company in its pork division in Ireland. In addition, Enterprise Ireland is continuing its efforts to stimulate further investment at the Rooskey plant.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	663	The Deputy will be aware that there have been significant employment developments for Donegal recently. In March 2006, I announced the establishment of a new Enterprise Managed Service Centre by AssetCo in Buncrana. The project involves an investment of €5.2 million and will lead to the creation of 130 new jobs. Also, in March 2006, I announced that Abbott, one of the world's largest healthcare companies, is to make a further high value healthcare investment in Ireland of €36 million, to establish a manufacturing facility in Donegal town which will create at least 155 high quality jobs with over 45% requiring a third level qualification. I announced 210 new jobs last September being created by Zeus Industrial Products, Letterkenny and PowerBoard, Burnfoot. These projects are being supported by the Industrial Development Agency and Enterprise Ireland.I can assure you that the State development agencies under my auspices, IDA, EI, FÁS and Donegal County Enterprise Board, are fully committed to supporting and promoting job creation and job retention in Donegal. In addition to recent job announcements, this commitment is also evidenced by ongoing development and support by the Agencies for a number of business parks and enterprise centres in Donegal. These include the completion of the IDA Letterkenny Business Park, the provision of a 25,000 square foot advance office building at Windyhall, the completion of site development work at Ballyshannon for a new facility and also a development at Buncrana, where IDA is working with a local developer to provide new manufacturing and office buildings. In addition to providing support for nine Community Enterprise Centres in Donegal, Enterprise Ireland has also provided substantial support for the expansion of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology Business Development Centre and the development of a Marine Biotechnology Centre.However, I also recognise that there have been significant job losses in Donegal in recent years, particularly in traditional sectors such as textiles and clothing. The Government is doing all in its power to create structures through its Enterprise Development and Training agencies, which will facilitate those who have lost jobs to gain new ones, particularly ones that offer more opportunity both in terms of skills and permanence.This Government recognizes the particular difficulties in Donegal and is working to assist in improving the overall environment to increase the attractiveness of Donegal as a location for enterprises. In that context, I established the Inter-Departmental Group on Donegal, which is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. I intend to announce the findings of the Group in the very near future, having consulted my Cabinet colleagues.Finally, I can assure the Deputy that support for job creation in Donegal will continue to be a priority for the State development agencies under the auspices of my Department.

Ireland signed and ratified the Revised Social Charter on 4 November 2000. The Revised Social Charter has 31 Articles. In preparing Reports, the Department has to consult both internally and with most other Government Departments in relation to updating material on any relevant legislative and/or administrative changes that have taken place which impact on our implementation of the Revised Social Charter. Given the range of issues to be covered and the number of Departments to be consulted, gathering and clarifying up- to-date responses on a wide range of topics can be quite demanding, having regard to the steady growth in other reporting obligations on all Departments.In light of the substantially increased reporting requirements under the Revised Social Charter — 31 Articles compared with 19 in the original Social Charter from 1961 — the Department undertook to review criticisms of the Irish response made by the European Committee of Social Rights — who examine in detail, individual Member States' Reports on the implementation of the Revised Social Charter — and how implementation might be made more effective in the future. As part of this process, officials of this department had a meeting in Dublin on 4 October 2005 with a Delegation from the Council of Europe, including their Secretariat and members of the European Committee of Social Rights.At that meeting, the delays in submitting our Second and Third Reports on our implementation of the Revised Social Charter were discussed. It was acknowledged by the Council of Europe delegation that 3 of the Articles in our Second Report had already been submitted to Strasbourg. However, as we had in parallel done some work on our Third Report — which updates Ireland's reporting on the 9 "core" Articles for the period ending 31 December 2004 — the Department agreed with the Council representatives to prioritise the completion of the Third Report, before reverting to the completion of the Second Report.The reason for this approach is that the Third Report is effectively, an update of our First Report submitted in May 2004 on the 9 core Articles, and it was anticipated that this Report could be completed quickly. In fact, I am happy to say that the Department submitted the completed Third Report last month. This Department will now complete the Second Report on the outstanding 21 Articles as the material involved is received from Departments and Agencies and edited by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Having due regard to other pressing demands, I expect that this process should be completed by mid July. Accordingly, there is no question of information being withheld from the Council of Europe and the Department is determined to eliminate backlogs in reporting developments as soon as possible. If, in effect, Ireland has been remiss in relation to any aspect of the European Social Charter, it has been in relation to some reporting requirements and not in relation to the substance of the Charter.I consider that the Revised Social Charter is being properly implemented by Ireland, having regard to our national legislation and administrative practices. Any queries raised by the European Committee of Social Rights are, and will continue to be, addressed as part of the Reporting procedures laid down by the Council of Europe.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	665	The Government has decided that the Headquarters of Enterprise Ireland, including 300 posts, will relocate to Shannon as part of the Decentralisation programme. The timing of the major move of Enterprise Ireland staff to Shannon Town is dependent on the assembly of sufficient suitably qualified and experienced people volunteering to transfer to Shannon, within the terms of the Government decision, to undertake the work of the areas scheduled for location in Shannon. This, in turn, is dependent, inter alia, on the outcome at national level of negotiations between the Department of Finance and the unions representing public sector staff in relation to the key issues of concern to the staff in the Agencies scheduled to transfer to regional locations.The most immediate implementation step for Enterprise Ireland is to provide for a new HQ building, designed to meet the business needs of the organisation. Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), has identified but not yet acquired a preferred site from the submissions received by the OPW in relation to the Shannon location. The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development. In addition, and in co-operation with Shannon Development and OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out. The site occupies a prime position near the centre of Shannon and is considered suitable for a major landmark building or civic structure related to the town centre.The most recent information from the CAF indicated that 19 Enterprise Ireland staff have applied for decentralisation to Enterprise Ireland in Shannon. Of these, 15 are Dublin based and 4 are based outside Dublin.

The report puts forward radical proposals for reform of the income support system for all parents on a low income. The report proposes the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents, the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents, focused provision of childcare, improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new Parental Allowance for low income families with young children.The Government has asked the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations of the discussion paper, including those related to childcare, education, training and activation measures and work on this has already commenced in consultation with the Departments and agencies concerned. Issues including the impact of the proposals on the qualified adult allowance, the limitation rule, part-time unemployment payments and age related poverty traps, will all be taken into account in the implementation of the proposals.As a follow-up to the publication of the discussion paper, I hosted a National Consultative Forum on 27th April 2006. This Forum was attended by social partners, representatives of organisations dealing with lone parents and the unemployed, representatives of Government departments and State agencies who will be responsible for the implementation of the proposals in the discussion paper and members of the Oireachtas. At the Forum, I heard the views of each organisation on the proposals including their comments on the proposed parental allowance and invited them to make a formal written submission setting out those views.The Government will listen closely to the views expressed and will give very serious consideration to them. As soon as I am convinced that we have reached conclusions that are fully workable and equitable, it will be my intention to bring forward proposals for legislation in the course of this year.

The mailshots form part of the Department's control activities on the Child Benefit scheme. In the past 5 years a total of 6 mailshots have issued to Child Benefit recipients. One result arising from the mailshots has been savings of some €22m in Child Benefit expenditure. A single claim termination can result in annual savings of up to €10,000.Mailshots result in a significant number of letters being returned undelivered by An Post, thus indicating that the customer is not at the address notified to the Department. The customer may simply have moved address and not notified the Department or alternatively could have left the country, in which case Child Benefit may no longer be payable.Details of the mailshots carried out over the last 5 years and resultant action are as follows: July 2001 — A mailshot issued to all Child Benefit customers informing them of budget changes and information concerning the upcoming EURO conversion and how it would affect their payments. The total number of forms issued was 511,000 at a cost of £219,498. Over 10,000 letters were returned undelivered by An Post as the customer was not at the address. Subsequent investigation of these cases resulted in 353 claims being terminated as the whereabouts of the customer could not be established.In July 2002 and again in July 2003, a mailshot was issued to Child Benefit customers being paid by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT), informing them of recent budget rate changes. A total of 171,000 customers were contacted. The total cost was €68,773.00 in 2002 and €72,618 in 2003. As a result of these mailshots over 5,000 letters were returned. Following investigation, 605 claims were terminated as the customer was found to have either left the state or their whereabouts could not be established. In August 2004, an information mailshot issued to the then 195,580 EFT-paid customers informing them of the most recent rates increases. The total cost was €83,950. A total of 6,186 letters was returned undelivered. On investigation of these cases some 1,065 claims were terminated.During 2005 a targeted mailshot was issued, for control purposes, to a group of over 10,000 customers to confirm their residency status. The cost of this was €5,993. A total of 816 letters was returned and after investigation some 250 claims were terminated.In April 2006, an information leaflet was issued by the Department, on behalf of the Office of the Minister for Children, to the 259,000 Child Benefit customers who will qualify for the Early Childcare Supplement (ECS). This provided information to customers regarding claim and payment arrangements in connection with the scheme. The total cost of this was €135,000. To date 4,500 letters have been returned and investigations are ongoing to establish the present position of these customers.

The allowance is paid in respect of the main claimant and is not available to those receiving social welfare support as qualified adults on the pension of their spouse or partner. There is no necessity for a person to make an application for payment of the allowance as it is applied automatically to their pension when they reach 80 years of age. At present, there are approximately 5,500 qualified adults who are over 80 years of age on old age contributory and retirement pensions. The cost of extending the allowance to this group would be about €3 million per annum.

Currently some 55% of customers have chosen to receive payment through their local post office. Payments are also made by cheque to the home address of the customer and direct payment to the customer's bank or building society account. Some 9% are paid by cheque through the postal system and 36% have chosen to receive direct electronic payment to their bank or building society account.My objective is to ensure that a wide choice of payment options is available to customers of my Department and that service is continually improved by providing access to an increasing range of payment services. Customers opt for a particular payment method having regard to their own circumstances.It is Government policy to facilitate the greater use of electronic payment systems in the economy in the interests of developing a world class payments environment in Ireland. In this context, I have initiated a strategic review of my Department's payment requirements with the aim of identifying a payment solution for the future, which will be flexible, cost-effective and customer focused. I am aware that An Post is conscious of the need to introduce modern payment systems and my expectation is that An Post will respond to developments and product innovation in the money transmission market so that it can maintain its position as a leading player in this area of commercial activity and thus ensure a viable network of post offices serving the needs of local communities throughout the country.An Post and my Department have been partners in the delivery of social welfare payments since the foundation of the State. I am confident that An Post and the network of post offices will continue to play a key role in the delivery of social welfare payments in the future.

Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Division of the Health Service Executive, a weekly or monthly rent supplement is available to assist eligible people who are unable to meet their immediate accommodation needs through their own resources.In recent years, a significant number of people have come to rely on rent supplements for extended periods, including people on local authority housing waiting lists. In response to this situation, the Government has introduced new rental assistance arrangements giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis. When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, the new rental accommodation scheme.The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that at the beginning of June 2006 over 1,200 tenants have been accommodated under the Rental Accommodation Scheme, with a further 770 accommodated in local authority housing. This is the first step towards having the new arrangements fully operational nationwide by September 2008. These arrangements are intended to be a long-term housing option for the people concerned. In order to finance this initiative €19 million was transferred from my Department's Vote to the Environment, Heritage and Local Government Vote in 2005 and a further €19 million has been transferred for 2006. Similar arrangements will apply in successive years as the new arrangements are fully implemented.The new rental assistance arrangements provide an imaginative additional approach in supporting people with longer-term housing needs. By definition, people on rent supplement for extended durations have a long-term housing need that they cannot otherwise meet, and many of them are on local authority housing lists. The new scheme, particularly the rental accommodation component, will reduce housing waiting lists by providing a useful additional mechanism for providing social housing, alongside more traditional social housing construction programmes and the expansion of the voluntary housing sector.At the end of 2005, 60,176 households were in receipt of assistance under the rent supplement scheme. Over half of these, almost 33,000 tenants, have been on the scheme for 18 months or more. My Department and the Health Service Executive are actively assisting the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in implementing the new arrangements. I am satisfied that the difficulties faced by long-term private sector tenants are being tackled and all of the relevant agencies are co-operating actively to make the new system work successfully.In recent weeks I have mentioned the concept of some form of housing supplement as a possible alternative to rent supplementation. I am conscious that the rent supplement scheme has become a form of social housing in its own right and for this reason, I am anxious that all avenues are explored to provide financial support for people on long-term rent supplementation who may be in a position to purchase their own home. In this regard my Department and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are together overseeing a study which will examine possible approaches. I have asked that the study be undertaken as a matter of urgency and I expect to have a report in the Autumn.

These agreements came into effect between 1989 and 1999, except for that with the UK which came into effect in 1971. Ireland also has a bilateral understanding with Quebec since 1 October 1994.All of these agreements are currently in operation and working satisfactorily. The main purpose of the agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both in Ireland and the other country to which the agreement applies. In the case of certain countries they have limited application as the EU Regulations normally apply in these cases.Liaison procedures have been established with each country and are kept under constant review. Regular contact is made with the appropriate agencies to ensure the smooth transfer of the necessary information required to decide on claims. At present, no significant difficulties are being experienced in relation to any of the agreements.For all schemes, the time taken to process claims that fall to be examined under bilateral agreements is longer than that for standard Irish entitlements, reflecting the added complexity that arises in determining entitlements under these agreements. While every effort is made to minimise processing times, the overriding objective in dealing with these claims is to ensure that people receive their full entitlements.I am satisfied that overall the procedures are working effectively and efficiently.

People aged over 70 years of age can qualify regardless of their income or household composition.Widows and widowers aged from 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.A range of proposals, have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of free schemes. These proposals are being kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.

Any person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an on-going basis is not entitled to an unemployment payment.Part-time fire-fighters are entitled to an unemployment payment in respect of days that they are engaged in fire-fighting or training. They are, however, required to satisfy the statutory conditions for the receipt of an unemployment payment i.e. they must continue to be available for and genuinely seeking work and, in this respect, Deciding Officers do not treat them differently to any other unemployment benefit or assistance claimant.In applying the legislation, Deciding Officers have regard to the availability of job vacancies in the locality, the age and educational qualifications together with the family circumstances of the particular claimant. Regard is also had to the extent to which a claimant has sought to take advantage of existing labour market opportunities in their locality.The legislation does not impose any restriction or limitation on the right of a person to the opportunity to engage in the employment of his or her choice. Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment and there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature she or he would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment.After a period of unemployment, a person must be prepared to accept any employment for which she or he is qualified. It is a cardinal principle of the availability for work condition that a person's unemployment must be involuntary and it is not possible for an unemployed person to hold herself or himself available exclusively for employment that is within a restricted distance from a fire station where she or he is employed as a part-time fire person. Such action would be taken as placing an unreasonable restriction on his/her availability to secure full-time employment.While the importance of retained fire brigade personnel is fully recognised, the introduction of special arrangements exempting them from the requirements to fulfil any of the statutory conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit or assistance would raise equity issues vis-à-vis other claimants to unemployment payments and there are no current plans to make any changes to this legislation

This is a long-standing provision and it mirrors similar exclusions under employment protection legislation. This applies to both men and women in family employment and recognises the practical difficulties in establishing the nature of a genuine contract of employment in such circumstances.The person concerned applied for Maternity Benefit. During an examination of her application it became clear that she was employed by her husband and the case was referred to Scope section in my Department for determination of the insurability of her employment. A deciding officer issued a formal decision that her employment was not insurable under the social welfare acts as it was excepted under the above legislation. The person appealed this decision and an Appeals Officer upheld the deciding officer's decision.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	680	Under the Maritime Safety Act 2005 local authorities have been given the necessary powers to control the operation of jet skis and other fast powered craft in their functional areas.The framework for regulating such craft came from the 2000 Report of the Action Group on Small Powered Recreational Craft (including personal watercraft) which concluded that the primary public policy response should be the use of local bye-laws. Conditions and issues vary in different parts of the country and it makes sense that those closest and with local knowledge regulate for the particular circumstances.Section 6 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005, provides that by-laws may be made regulating or controlling the operation of craft or specified craft, including jet skis, by local authorities in waters in their functional areas, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland in waters under their control or management. The by-laws can be used to prohibit or restrict in specified waters or at specified times/periods the use of such craft, for the purposes of, amongst other things, preventing nuisance to persons.The Maritime Safety Directorate of my Department has issued guidelines to the relevant authorities, including Dublin City Council, on the powers available to them to regulate craft under the 2005 Act.Furthermore, any person who feels that noise from a watercraft is causing a serious nuisance may raise the matter with the local authority or harbour authority concerned for consideration having regard to the provisions of the 2005 Act.Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a local authority or any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal options available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and on that Department's website, www.environ.ie.

One of the specific objectives given to the Commission in the 2003 Act is to promote access to small public service vehicles by people with disabilities.The Commission for Taxi Regulation has published a detailed Action Plan 2006-2007, Driving Forward, which sets out a range of changes the Commission proposes to make over the next two years in relation to the control and regulation of taxis, hackneys and limousines and their drivers. Among the specific proposals being developed by the Commission are measures aimed at improving accessibility. I understand that in July 2006 a further consultation process will be undertaken by the Commission in relation to vehicle standards, with a particular emphasis on improving accessibility.The Sectoral Plan for Transport under the Disability Act 2006 is currently being finalised for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas by end July 2006, as required by the Act. The Plan will also set out a programme for action on accessibility in a number of key transport areas, including the taxi and hackney sector.Data in relation to the overall number of taxis licensed to operate and the percentage of that total that are wheelchair accessible taxis is available from the Commission for Taxi Regulation.

One of the specific objectives given to the Commission in the 2003 Act is to promote access to small public service vehicles by people with disabilities.The Commission for Taxi Regulation has published a detailed Action Plan 2006-2007, Driving Forward, which sets out a range of changes the Commission proposes to make over the next two years in relation to the control and regulation of taxis, hackneys and limousines and their drivers. Among the specific proposals being developed by the Commission are measures aimed at improving accessibility. I understand that in July 2006 a further consultation process will be undertaken by the Commission in relation to vehicle standards, with a particular emphasis on improving accessibility.The Sectoral Plan for Transport under the Disability Act 2006 is currently being finalised for presentation to the Houses of the Oireachtas by end July 2006, as required by the Act. The Plan will also set out a programme for action on accessibility in a number of key transport areas, including the taxi and hackney sector.

South Kildare Community Transport Ltd. is one of the pilot projects being funded under the RTI.While Pobal administers the RTI on behalf of the Department of Transport, the individual RTI groups are responsible for the operational aspects of the initiative, such as route planning and related matters. My Department has no role in these matters. However, I will convey the Deputy's concerns in the matter to Pobal.The pilot period for the RTI comes to a close at the end of 2006 and the Minister of Transport, Martin Cullen T.D., has already announced his intention to put the scheme on a permanent footing from 2007 onwards, following a consultation period later in the year to which the public will be invited to respond.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I propose to take Questions Nos. 331, 332, 334, 335, 336, 337 and 338 together.Limerick docks are owned and operated by Shannon Foynes Port Company. The company is a State-owned company established under the Harbours Act 1996. The Act provides that the principal objects of the company include the provision of such facilities, services and lands within its harbour for ships, goods and passengers as it considers necessary. The company is required to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour.The company manages six different port installations at various locations within the Shannon estuary and it projects significant increases in the volume of trade within the estuary over the coming years. The company has stated that investment in new modern facilities that can handle bigger ships is required to accommodate this growth in trade in the region. In line with the company's commercial mandate under the Harbours Act 1996, decisions regarding the use of the land within the port estate are primarily a matter for the port company and its board.The company is required to comply with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, which states that disposals of land must be by competitive tendering, other than in exceptional circumstances. The company's latest annual report for 2005 confirms compliance with the code for that year. These guidelines are in place to ensure that State companies carry out transactions with the maximum openness and transparency with regard to value for money for the taxpayer.Accordingly, it was not necessary for me to give approval to decisions the company has taken thus far on Limerick docks, nor is an impact study required before a final decision is made. I am aware that on 15 March last Shannon Foynes Port Company announced that it was conducting a strategic review of its property portfolio, which the company states could result in a major expansion and upgrade of its facilities in the Shannon Estuary at a cost of over €100 million.As part of this Strategic Review the company sought tenders for two sites within the Limerick docks, and has also sought expressions of interest regarding the entire docks. However, no decision has been taken with regard to the sale of lands or indeed the closing of the port facilities within the docks.Whatever the conclusions of the strategic review, the company has said it will continue to work in partnership with other stakeholders in the region and that a comprehensive consultation will take place in advance of any final decision being made with respect to the future of Limerick docks.The company has informed me that the port users have already been afforded regular opportunities to interact with the management and Board of Shannon Foynes Port Company since the inception of the Limerick Dockland Initiative. The company states that it has formally met with the Limerick Port Users Group on a number of occasions since 2003.The Government's Ports Policy Statement from January 2005 outlines that the disposal of non-core assets is a potential source of funding for new port developments. It also identifies as a key challenge the provision of additional port capacity to meet the demands of the growing economy.A process is underway in my Department to examine future port capacity requirements at a national level, particularly for unitised trade. Seven project proposals to increase capacity have been received from the ports, including one from Shannon Foynes Port Company.Shannon Foynes Port Company's plans are to increase both short sea and deep sea port capacity within the estuary, and in that sense such plans are consistent with both national and EU maritime transport policy.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	691	I am aware of the National Safety Council Newsletter of August 2003 referred to by the Deputy which indicated that research into child vehicle occupant fatalities in the period from 1996 to 2000 and showed that 77 per cent of child fatalities were not wearing a child restraint or seatbelt.The latest report on the wearing of seat belts, the National Roads Authority 2005 Survey of Seat Belt Wearing Rates, was published earlier this year and is available from the NRA. The survey indicates that overall front wearing rates in 2005 improved to 86% (an increase from 84% in 2003, 72% in 2002, and 57% in 1999.) Overall rear seat-belt wearing rates in 2005 was 46%. This is the same as the level estimated in 2003.A survey was conducted into the seat-belt wearing practice of primary and secondary school-goers and front seat belt wearing rates averaged 70% for children attending primary school (68% in 2003), and 68% for those attending secondary school (62% in 2003).Rear seat belt wearing rates also improved showing an average of 60% for children attending primary schools (increase from 48% in 2003), and 55% for those attending secondary schools (increase from 44% in 2003).The driver of a vehicle in which safety belt use is compulsory is responsible for ensuring that passengers under 17 years are restrained by a safety belt or appropriate child restraint. Failure to comply with this requirement is a penalty point offence. The ultimate aim is to have full compliance with seat belt wearing.The Road Safety Authority (RSA) will have a significant input into advancing the road safety agenda in the future. The functions assigned to the Road Safety Authority include a mandate in relation to the collation of data and statistics as well as policy research and development.

Agreement on the issue was finalised earlier this year and the Board of Foras na Gaeilge was subsequently asked to bring forward firm proposals in relation to the phases of locating a staff complement of 30 in Gaoth Dobhair, as well as the precise sections and functions to be located there.I have been informed by Foras na Gaeilge that the issue was discussed at their Board meeting on 8 May 2006 and that it will be discussed further at their next Board meeting which is scheduled for 26 June 2006. I look forward to these proposals being made available shortly after that meeting.

The selection process to fill a further 2 posts is ongoing. The full complement of staff will be relocated when Pobal's permanent offices are complete, which is expected early in 2008. One post was filled by an officer relocating from Dublin and the remaining posts have or are being filled by way of local recruitment.As regards decentralisation to Mayo, the Department is committed to relocating 140 posts to Knock Airport. OPW have indicated that the Department's headquarters building will be in place by mid 2008. To further the decentralisation process, 65 posts will be relocated into temporary accommodation in Tubbercurry from next month. Those posts will then be relocated to Knock Airport when the new building is ready.We have received 145 applications to decentralise to Knock Airport, 48 of which came from officers located in Dublin.

In these circumstances, the participant must transfer to the RSS within 15 months of the cessation of CE.In this particular case, the applicant's UB claim is on the basis of a CE Scheme which finished in September 2004 and is, therefore, outside the 15 month limit. Notwithstanding the above, the applicant can re-apply for participation on the RSS after he has exhausted his UB entitlement if he is subsequently in receipt of a qualifying Social Welfare payment.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	698	Firstly, I wish to advise the Deputy that, in accordance with the provisions of the legislation, all provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003 will come into operation automatically on the 14 July 2006. Consequently, the following provisions of the Act which have yet to be commenced will come into effect on that date:•Section 7, which relates to the publication of Acts of the Oireachtas simultaneously in both Irish and English.•Section 8, which relates to the right of a person to be heard and to use the Irish language in court proceedings.•Section 9(3), which relates to communications by public bodies with the public in writing or by electronic mail for the purpose of providing information.As the Deputy is aware, the Act seeks to provide a framework and mechanism with a view to ensuring that the State's constitutional obligations with respect to providing public services through Irish are met in a coherent way with progress being achieved in the context of existing resources over time. The Act provides for this to be achieved in three ways:(i) Through directly applicable provisions of the Act which are applicable to all public bodies, including the provisions outlined above and also, the duty of public bodies under section 9(2), to reply to correspondence — in writing or by electronic mail — in the language in which that correspondence was written.(ii) Through the agreement of language schemes with individual public bodies that provide for significant improvement in the level of public services available through Irish over time subject to the level of demand; and(ii) Through Regulations to be made by me as Minister in accordance with the terms of the Act.To date, I have agreed language schemes with 27 public bodies and have requested a further 70 public bodies to prepare such language schemes.In relation to the issue of contemporaneous publications of Government papers I assume that the Deputy is referring to the obligations placed on public bodies under section 10 of the Act. Section 10 provides for the simultaneously publication in both official languages of a what is in fact a very limited number of key documents such as annual reports, annual financial statements/ accounts and documents setting out public policy proposals (examples of this last category would include Green Papers and White Papers published by Government Departments).These are all key documents by which public bodies account back to the general public, to their specific customers and to us as members of the Oireachtas in relation to how they have in the previous year or propose to in future discharge their public functions.It is the case that many Government Departments and other public bodies do not have translation capacity in-house and that external expertise has to be bought in. As the Deputy will be aware, I have requested Foras na Gaeilge to develop an accreditation system for Irish language translators. This will be the first such accreditation system to be made available for Irish language translators. As part of the system, it is intended that a panel of accredited translators will be established, and I understand the panel will be available to the public and private sectors shortly.

In this regard, nine local authorities funded 52 sets of lights at a cost to CLÁR of €154,177.I subsequently introduced a fully funded Flashing Amber Safety Lights measure in 2005 for schools without same under CLÁR and all proposals received from the local authorities in the original CLÁR areas were approved at a total cost of nearly €1.7m for 242 schools. Five local authorities claimed €236,531 in respect of 37 completed projects. Any residual projects in the original areas, that may have been inadvertently omitted by the local authorities in the first round, can continue to be submitted.In May 2006, I announced that funding in the region of €3m for 2006/2007 is being made available for the provision of Flashing Amber Safety Lights at all primary schools in the extended CLÁR areas that do not have some already. This measure is fully funded under the CLÁR programme and all the relevant local authorities have been asked to submit proposals. The maximum cost per set of these lights is €7,000. Should a local authority opt to install electronic speed limit signs with the amber lights, the maximum funding under CLÁR stands at €7,000 towards the cost.

Community Services Programme The Social Economy Programme transferred to my Department on 1st January 2006. I have re-named this Programme the Community Services Programme, to reflect the fact that I have changed the nature of the programme from a labour market training scheme to a scheme to provide support for essential community services. I have also secured an additional €5 million to fund new projects in 2006. Eligible activities include:—Community Childcare Services—Community Services for the Elderly (Excluding Health Care Provision)—Community Services for People with Disabilities (Excluding Health Care Provision)—Supervising Community Halls & Facilities in disadvantaged communities (RAPID etc.)—Island Projects—Rural Tourism-Heritage Centres and Managed Walks—Community RadioThe overall budget for 2006 is now €42 million.White Paper fundingFunding under the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and for Developing the Relationship between the State and the Community and Voluntary Sector was published in September 2000. It sets out the rationale for developing the relationship between the State and the sector and the principles, which should underpin this relationship. The White Paper included a wide range of cross-cutting recommendations and a number of funding initiatives detailed as follows:•Funding Scheme to Support the Role of Federations, Networks and Umbrella Bodies in the Community and Voluntary SectorThe White Paper provided for an allocation of funding over a three-year period to end of 2006 for a scheme to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies in providing support services to their member groups and in representing their interests. There are currently 32 groups being funded in 2006 at an annual cost of €2.6m.•Funding Scheme for Training and Supports in the Community and Voluntary SectorThe White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity recognised that the growth of the Community and Voluntary Sector in recent years has created increased needs for training and supports for the Sector. The White Paper provided for multi-annual Training and Supports Grants. There are currently 20 groups being funded in 2006 at an annual cost of €600,000.The Department is engaged in a review of funding provided under the White Paper. It is expected that a new Scheme will be advertised later this year.National Anti-Poverty NetworksThe National Anti-Poverty Networks scheme assists National Anti-Poverty Networks to develop their capacities to contribute to policy development at national level and to develop the capacities of the National Anti-Poverty Networks members to draw policy from the experiences at local and national levels. 9 groups are currently being funded at a cost of €1.4m in 2006.Supporting VolunteeringIn 2005 the Department decided to fund an interim three-year package of volunteering initiatives to promote and develop volunteering in Ireland at the local level. Funding in 2006 totalling €954,594 is being provided to 8 Volunteer Bureaux, Volunteer Centres Ireland, Focus Ireland, Boardmatch, Young Social Innovators, and the Community Learning Programme Project. Under the LDSIP, €500,000 has been ringfenced for a range of local volunteering initiatives by Partnership Companies. In addition, €1.4m from the Department's Volunteering Cohesion Fund was provided to County Development Boards (CDBs) in December 2005 for a range of volunteering initiatives; €70,000 from the volunteering Cohesion Fund has also been provided to Carlow CDB in 2006 to date.PhilanthropyMy Department has committed funding to Philanthropy Ireland totalling €300,000 over three years to 2008 for the promotion of philanthropic giving.Community Development Programme (CDP)The Community Development Programme (CDP) is designed to reduce poverty and social exclusion in both urban and rural areas through targeting support at disadvantaged and socially excluded communities. €23.95 million has been allocated to the programme in 2006, providing funding to 182 community development projects nationwide.Funded projects:•have an anti-poverty focus and promote the participation of people experiencing poverty and exclusion at all levels of the project•act as a resource within the communities of which they are a part•are managed by local voluntary management committees made up predominantly of people from the local area/target groups who themselves have experience of disadvantage and social exclusion•promote co-ordination and co-operation between community, voluntary and statutory groups in their areas.Some 30,000 people use the services and resources of their local CDP on an annual basis, with 15,000 of these participating in CDP-based training and education courses. CDPs also provide resources/facilities for over 700 local community organisations. These include groups representing lone parents, people with disabilities, the elderly, youth groups, childcare groups and other miscellaneous groups working with disadvantaged communities.Programme of Grants for Locally-Based Community and Voluntary OrganisationsThe Programme of Grants for Locally-Based Community and Voluntary Organisations is funded by this Department and operates throughout the country, supporting the activities of local voluntary and community groups who are addressing disadvantage in their community.The Programme makes funds available for small-scale refurbishment of premises, for the purchase of essential equipment, including I.T. equipment, and for education, training and research. The maximum grant for refurbishment under the 2005 Scheme was €40,000; equipment €10,000; and for training, education and research also €10,000.The 2006 Programme will be advertised in the coming weeks in the national and provincial newspapers and a copy of the guidelines and application form will be available on the Department's website at that time.Scheme of Community Support for Older People (CSOP)The CSOP Scheme is also funded by this Department and aims to encourage and assist the community's support for vulnerable older people, aged 65 years and older, by means of a community-based grant scheme. This Scheme provides funding for door locks, window locks, door chains, security lighting, smoke alarms and towards the once-off cost of installing socially-monitored alarm systems. Any local voluntary or community-based organisation in any part of the country, especially those working with or providing support for older people, can apply to the Department for funding under the Scheme.RAPID programmeThe RAPID programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 45 designated RAPID areas. The priorities for each RAPID area are identified locally by each RAPID Area Implementation Team (AIT), and are incorporated into a plan for each area. Each of the nine Departments represented on the RAPID National Monitoring Committee, which I chair reports on a quarterly basis on progress in relation to the proposals from these plans that fall within their remit.It is estimated that over €337m has been invested in extra infrastructure in RAPID areas in social provision under the NDP since the programme's inception. In 2004 a new funding mechanism, RAPID Leverage Fund, was introduced which supports small-scale local actions through co-funding with other Departments/Local Agencies. This fund which is administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs allows many small-scale actions to be dealt with more effectively at local level. In 2006 a sum of €7.8m was allocated by my Department for these schemes.LDSIP (Local Development Social Inclusion Programme)The LDSIP is a series of measures designed to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion. The programme is delivered at local level by 38 area partnerships, 31 community partnerships and 2 employment pacts. The following groups are specifically targeted: long-term unemployed, socially and economically disadvantaged women, young people at risk, travellers, people with disabilities, homeless people, ethnic minorities, lone parents, ex-prisoners, low income households.€48.8 million is being spent on this Programme in 2006.Dormant AccountsDisbursements from the Dormant Accounts Fund are designed to tackle economic, social and educational disadvantage and to assist persons with a disability. In line with the commitment in the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Plan, allocations from the Fund are prioritised towards those areas designated as most disadvantaged (i.e. RAPID, Local Drugs Task Force and CLÁR areas). Under the initial round of funding, 521 projects were approved involving a total allocation of approximately €60 million. 84 of these projects are based in CLÁR areas and the allocation in respect of these projects exceeds €10 million.All of the various programmes, measures and schemes outlined above make due provision for the participation of the communities or targeted groups or individuals in the relevant decision making processes.

Eligible projects include amenity areas and parks, footpaths and walking areas, playgrounds and other recreational facilities, local heritage projects, tidy town projects, public lighting, enhancing streetscapes, church car parks etc. Projects promoted by Sporting Clubs/Organisations, which are outside their mainstream sporting activities and of general benefit to the local community, can also be considered for funding. The funding may also be used for the establishment of farmers' markets or the upgrade of existing farmers' markets in CLÁR areas. The average cost per project is €100,000 funded as follows:•33.33% to be funded by CLÁR to a max of €33,333•16.66% to be funded by the LEADER Group to a max of €16,666•16.66% matching local contribution.•33.33% to be funded by the local authority.As per LEADER Operating Rules, voluntary labour and donations i.e. buildings, land etc., can be included as part of the local matching funding. However, 10% of the local contribution must be in the form of cash. In the event of a project costing more than €100,000, the excess private funding can be sourced from either the local contribution and/or the local authority.Expenditure to dateThis expenditure relates to projects approved in 2005 and early 2006 when the maximum cost per project was €30,000. The same percentage funding ratios applied.

It comprises twenty-five mainly Irish grant-making trusts and foundations, with disbursements to a wide variety of causes and needs and community and voluntary organisations in Ireland.I hope to be in a position to announce further measures in the near future.

The intention is that, from 2007, there will be one structure delivering services in any given area and fewer structures overall in the country.The Boards of Partnerships established under the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme are required to have a broad representation of locally based representatives which includes the community and voluntary sectors, statutory agencies, social partners, and public representatives. Arrangements are in place to ensure that Boards maintain a balance level of representation across these sectors during the course of the annual funding cycles and regular reviews.With respect to the Community Development Programme (CDP), Community Development Projects are required to have a Board structure drawn from the local area within which they operate. This includes representatives of the target groups served by the Project. The Department reviews the composition of Boards regularly and ensures compliance with guidelines on this matter during site visits and ongoing inspection and audit work.The boards of all local development structures, including any new entities, will be expected to continue to operate in accordance with good governance principles and to have appropriate mechanisms in place to enable accountability to their communities and their funders. To this end, it is intended to address the procedures for the establishment of the boards of the new bodies and their membership in the context of the cohesion process, with particular reference to ensuring that genuine community representation is secured. It is also intended to have public representatives on these boards. It is in this way I see the democratic legitimacy of the local boards being achieved.

Category D (new entrants to farming) continues to be a non-mandatory category.The time frame for allocations under the 2006 National Reserve will depend on the volume of applications to be processed.

Following an inspection dated 31st March 2003 it was decided that the application could not be processed as it was not in compliance with Article 7 of Regulation EC 1259/1999. The Department were also not satisfied that the applicant's flock was managed independently and therefore the allocation of a Flock Number in this case was denied.The person named appealed this decision at an oral hearing on 6th July 2004 where the Department explained that the application for a Flock Number was rejected on the grounds that the applicant did not have proper holding facilities which should have conformed to Sections 7, 8, 9 and 11 of the Health and Safety Act of 1989 along with the problem of not having the perimeter stock proofed at the time of inspection.It was decided following this appeal hearing that, as the applicant had addressed the questions of stock proofing and handling facilities, complied with the EU Regulations and submitted applications for the 2003 and 2004 EU Ewe Premium Schemes in respect of twenty-six and forty-four animals respectively, the Department would issue a Flock Number backdated to December 2002. All monies due to the applicant will issue shortly.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I presume that this Question relates to the compensation package available under the agreement on reform of the EU sugar regime. There are three elements to the compensation package. The first element is the compensation to beet growers of up to 64% of the reduction in the minimum price for beet. This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing Single Payment Scheme and will be payable from this year, is worth approximately €123m to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.The second element is the restructuring aid covering the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry involving factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland's case, this would be worth up to €145m. This aid is subject to the submission by the processor of an aid application including a detailed restructuring plan for the industry following consultations with the beet growers. Where restructuring takes place in the first year of the new sugar regime, as in Ireland's case, the application must be submitted by 31 July 2006. The third element of the package is the diversification aid, worth almost €44m in Ireland's case, which would be drawn down in the framework of a national restructuring programme.With regard to the second element of the package, the Council Regulation provides that at least 10% of the restructuring aid shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That percentage may be increased by Member States after consultation of interested parties provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured. In that context, my Department issued an open call for submissions last month with a closing date of 2 June. These submissions are subject to scrutiny by Indecon International Economic Consultants, who have been appointed by the Government to provide me with independent expert advice on matters relating to the implementation of the restructuring fund. A final decision on the percentage will be made in due course having regard to this advice and the recently-adopted Commission Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the restructuring aid. Payment arrangements will then be announced.

Full payment of €1,434.67 in respect of these entitlements issued to him on 1 December 2005. Prior to 2 August 2000, the herd number was in the name of the late brother of the person named. In accordance with the provisions of the Single Payment Scheme, 65.73 standard entitlements, at a net unit value of €11.27, were established in the name of this late brother. An official from my Department has been in direct contact with the person named requesting him to submit an application for the transfer of his late brother's entitlements by inheritance. As soon as the completed application form is received in my Department, it will be processed immediately.It is also noted that the late brother of the person named was a participant in the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS), which, in some cases, required partial de-stocking. My Department is currently reviewing these cases with a view to granting the higher sheep numbers prior to joining REPS in the calculation of Single Payment Entitlements. In this case, the years 1997 and 1998 are being used to re-calculate the entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme and this measure will only be implemented where it proves more financially beneficial. If the inheritance application of the person named is successful he will also inherit these Single Payment Entitlements.

I submitted a proposal to the Commission requesting co-funding and approval for a range of measures to assist those in the industry who suffered financial losses arising from the recent disturbances in the poultry market. These proposed measures included schemes of payment to breeders who had to destroy hatching eggs and reduce their breeding stock capacity, to growers and processors who had to reduce throughputs and to operators who had to carry unusually high stock levels of poultry meat due to a virtual collapse in our export markets.The Commission has now presented its first outline of a draft regulation for the information of Member States. This draft includes only some of the measures in my proposal. I along with a number of other Member States raised the issue at Council this week and pressed for the extension of the range of measures being considered by the Commission. The matter will come up again for discussion and probable vote at the meeting of the management committee for poultry meat and eggs on 21 June. My delegation to that meeting will present the case for further measures to be included. The Commission will be aiming for consistency across all Member States who have proposed schemes as regards the types of measures that will be allowed and the rates of funding. It is my intention that once any measures are approved by the EU, we will expedite implementation of the appropriate schemes here as soon as possible.

Currently, two hundred and twenty eight people work in my Department's office in Cavan, including 57 job sharing staff. These staff are fully engaged in work on Accounts, Legal and Land Services, Livestock Breeding, Integrated Controls, BSE, Scrapie Medicines, District Veterinary Operations, Feed Fertiliser Grain Pigs and Poultry, Beef and Sheepmeat and on the residual processing of the old coupled livestock payment schemes. However, the Department does foresee some changes to the work areas in Cavan arising over the next months into 2007. Overall this will result in a net decrease of up to 25 staff in Cavan or approximately 10%. This will occur through natural wastage and the transfer of staff to offices in other Departments in Cavan.

The proposals, which the Minister has outlined, were developed in conjunction with my Department and with the input of Teagasc and address a range of important issues identified in the Teagasc submission and raised by the farming bodies. I am satisfied that the changes proposed to the Commission will be of major benefit to Irish farmers, in that they will provide them with greater flexibility in complying with fertiliser limits and simplify certain aspects of the Regulations.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 to 371, inclusive, together.Community rules have been established to ensure the protection of animal and public health in the importation of animal products into the EU. These harmonized controls are applied at the main points of entry into the EU at approved Border Inspection Posts (BIP). Importers are required to demonstrate compliance with the requirements that such products have been sourced in approved countries from approved establishments, that they travel with the required health certification issued by the competent authorities of the exporting country and that prior notice of import has been given to the BIP at which entry into the EU is proposed. They also apply in the case of the personal import of animal products from third countries for one's own personal consumption. In such cases they may only be released on to the market where they have undergone BIP control and are accompanied by the Common Veterinary Entry Document (CVED) endorsed by the BIP veterinary officer.Application of these EU controls is risk based and they are operated in close co-operation with the Customs services. BIPs would also assess for risks and carry out their random controls on consignments based on experience, instances of previous non-compliance in relation to importers, countries of origin, particular animal products as well as on consignments where no declaration of animal product content is provided. Commercial consignments seized at Irish BIPs for return to the country of origin or destruction at the importers expense have been recorded as follows:YearTotal Number of Seized ConsignmentsTotal Quantity of Animal Products Seized (kgs.)20052137,110.122006 to 31 May1956,942.5To enforce its personal import rules the EU has regulated that at all points of entry into the EU a general ban on passengers importing meat and meat products and milk and milk products be applied, that this ban be brought to the attention of passengers and that Member States operate controls on the personal baggage of passengers arriving into the EU at these points. Transport operators who bring passengers from third countries into the EU are required to bring these regulations, including the ban, to the attention of passengers. Announcements are made on airlines and posters are on display at arrivals halls in airports and at the disembarkation points for sea passengers. Amnesty bins have been provided in the main airports for surrender of any animal product that has been inadvertently carried. My Department has put information on to its web site and transport operators, foreign embassies accredited to this country and Irish embassies abroad have been requested to inform travellers to this country and have been invited to include a link to my Department's web page.Officers of my Department are deployed to carry out passenger interviews and bag searches on a random basis at ports and airports where travellers from third countries arrive. This approach is risk based and is intended to focus on in the identification of passengers coming to this country from third countries as most of these arrive here through hub airports located in other Member States of the EU. My Department is also considering extension of the personal baggage import control through the deployment of a specially trained dog and its handler. The interception of illegal imports from passengers whose journeys commenced within the EU is also carried out. The following activities associated with this deployment have been recorded:YearNumber of Passengers InterviewedNumber of Bags SearchedNumber of Food SeizuresQuantity Seized (kgs.)200558,88414,1831,1755,156.752006*30,2786,7397924,310.5*To 31 May 2006.The Commission also monitors operation of personal import controls by the Member States through its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO). It is considering proposals including the introduction of a requirement for a written declaration to be made by each third country originating passenger concerning meat and milk products in their personal possession and extending the personal import ban to cover egg and egg products. Currently import of such animal products are banned under the EU Safeguard Decisions imposed wherever outbreaks of high pathogenic avian influenza are suspected or have occurred in third countries.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	721	The person named submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the Single Payments Scheme National Reserve under category C. Category C caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, sold the milk quota into the Milk Quota Restructuring Scheme and converted their enterprise to a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia or Arable Aid Schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002.The intention under this category is to compensate farmers who, having disposed of their milk quota, were unable to avail of the new dairy premium element of the Single Payment Scheme which was introduced for the first time in 2004, decoupled from production on 31 March 2005 and added to the existing Single Payment. The allocation represents the difference between the Single Payment established and the potential Single Payment that would otherwise have been established if the dairy premium element was included.

For all categories it is a requirement that a veterinary inspector must be satisfied, inter alia, that the sheep were resident on the holding of origin for 30 days (21 days for slaughter sheep) and that no sheep were moved onto the holding during the previous 21 days. However, as part of the development of an all-island animal health strategy, a derogation is applied from these requirements in the case of trade in sheep to and from Northern Ireland which are for immediate slaughter.There is no derogation from the requirement that all sheep for intra-community trade must be accompanied by the necessary intra-community health certification. I understand that specific measures are operated by the Northern Ireland authorities to control the movement of sheep into Northern Ireland from other parts of the United Kingdom and, under EU rules, sheep from Great Britain may be imported legitimately into this State provided they are accompanied by the necessary intra-community health certification.

That Department has now advised the Irish Prison Service that the essential requirements of the competition from which this individual was appointed would not have precluded anyone from being appointed by the age of thirty i.e. in sufficient time to acquire the maximum service of thirty years required for optimum superannuation benefits.Accordingly, the person in question (or anyone else appointed from the same competition) is not entitled to an award of professional added years.

This directive codifies in a single instrument the complex legislative provisions and the case law on free movement and residence. This directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 which came into force with effect from 28 April, 2006.The detailed information required by the Deputy, including a report listing the countries of origin of applicants for EU residency permits, is not maintained in the format requested. This would require an inordinate amount of time to obtain and an inappropriate expenditure of limited resources.The statistical data that is readily available is set out in the tabular statement below and only relates to cases where the application was made in writing to my Department (the data does not include persons who report to their local registration office to register and obtain the appropriate permission to remain).YearApplications receivedApplications processedApprovedRefusedCould not be processed200122018313702422200228836121112514200328823917606323200435537425107746200575756836618121There are a number of applications that have not been processed within the stipulated six month time frame laid down in the Directive.

There has been concern for some time about the scope that casinos offer for money laundering and the concealment of the proceeds of crime. This was highlighted in a recent report of an evaluation by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — the leading international anti-money laundering organisation — of Ireland's anti-money laundering legislation and other measures. In that Report, the FATF evaluation team expressed their concern and stated that ". . . . . this system [of private clubs operating as casinos] does create the potential for real AML/CFT (Money Laundering/Financing of Terrorism) risks.I also indicated in that reply that I intended to bring forward proposals for further changes to the gaming and lotteries legislation that will facilitate the prosecution of offences and the closing down of establishments engaged in such illegal operations. It is my intention to seek Government approval within the next few weeks for these changes, to be included, by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2006.My officials recently met with representatives of The Gaming and Leisure Association of Ireland in connection with this matter and the Association made a written submission to the Department following that meeting; in both those contexts the matters referred to in the Deputy's question were raised.

Following recommendations from the Garda authorities, I have approved the implementation of six new Garda CCTV systems. With the addition of these 6 new locations a total of 17 Garda Town Centre CCTV Systems, including Kilkenny, will be implemented in the following locations: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dungarvan, Ennis, Kilkenny, Kinsale, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tallaght, Tullamore and Waterford.As I have indicated previously I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of this CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. I believe that the answer is to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest extent possible, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector.In recent months the Garda Síochána have conducted a thorough examination of all aspects of Garda involvement in CCTV Systems. Following this review, I have recently received a comprehensive and innovative proposal for the project management and the outsourced service provision of Garda CCTV systems, including Kilkenny, from the Garda Commissioner.The Garda authorities wish to commence the initial public procurement process and I am also anxious to proceed urgently with this comprehensive request for tender to source the best CCTV service possible for Kilkenny and the other 16 locations selected. This will happen in conjunction with Section 38 of the Garda Síochána Act, 2005, which provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV in public places.My Department is currently in consultation with the Department of Finance with a view to proceeding as quickly as possible with the procurement process to contract the project managers and outsourced service providers for the development, installation and management of these CCTV systems.My ambition is to have a Garda CCTV system operating in Kilkenny and in the other locations, at the earliest opportunity, subject to compliance with relevant procurement legislation and procedures.

The traditional approach to sentencing is for the Oireachtas to lay down the maximum penalty and for a court having considered all the circumstances of the case to impose an appropriate penalty up to that maximum. This approach reflects the doctrine of the separation of powers. The Executive lays down the possible punishment range but it is for the Courts to decide the punishment to be applied to the offender taking account of the seriousness of the crime and all the circumstances of the case and of the offender.Statistics are, of course, compiled by the Courts Service, in relation to the business transacted by the Courts including, inter alia, sentencing, but it is recognised that more focussed information than is at present available is needed to inform sentencing policy. To this end, the Board of the Courts Service has established a Steering Committee chaired by Mrs Justice Susan Denham with the task of planning and providing a system of information about sentencing. The work of the committee is still underway.

The Bill, as agreed by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 14 June 2006, empowers a senior member of the Gardaí to apply to the District Court by way of a civil procedure for an order which will prohibit an adult from behaving in an anti-social manner. Specially tailored provisions, fully integrated into the Children Act 2001, are being provided for young people engaged in anti-social behaviour.The enactment of this Bill is a top priority and I hope to see it complete its passage through the Dáil and Seanad without any undue delay. Once the Bill is enacted I intend to consult (as provided for in section 1 of the Bill) with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána before commencing the provisions relating to anti-social behaviour. The purpose of these consultations is to ensure that the Gardaí have the systems and personnel in place to operate these provisions and that any necessary arrangements about, for example, training for Gardaí in relation to these provisions, will have been addressed.

Section 182 of the Bill as amended by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights amends section 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. Section 19 currently provides for specific offences relating to assaulting or obstructing a peace officer, that is, a member of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces or prison officers acting in the execution of their duty. Section 182 of the Criminal Justice Bill expands the definition of ‘peace officers' to include members of the fire brigade.In addition the Bill further amends section 19 in order to create specific offences of threatening, assaulting, resisting, wilfully obstructing or impeding doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists, other health service workers and any persons assisting them in or at a hospital. The penalties in relation to an offence under section 19 of the 1994 Act are also being increased. The maximum penalty for assault or threats to commit assault will be a fine and/or 7 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty in relation to wilful obstruction or impeding health service workers will be a fine of €2,500 and/or 6 months imprisonment.Although the law already provides for a range of assault type offences, I believe the special demands of acting in an emergency situation necessitate explicit statutory protection for this essential group of workers and those assisting them. That is why I brought forward my proposals to extend the existing offences relating to assaulting or obstructing peace officers to other workers providing emergency services. I am pleased that the Select Committee agreed my proposals on 14 June 2006.I am concerned that ambulance personnel acting in the execution of their duty outside the hospital environment should be comprehensively covered by these special statutory provisions. Accordingly I intend to bring forward a Report Stage amendment to include ambulance personnel in the definition of "peace officer". This will put them on the same footing and give them the same protection as members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces and prison officers.

In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.I understand the application from the person concerned was received in the Immigration Division on the 2nd June 2006 and will be dealt with in chronological order.

The areas where the allowance was to be paid were determined on the basis of Districts. These are Garda administrative areas, each comprising a number of Garda Stations, under the supervision of a Superintendent. It was not regarded as practicable to arrange for members of the force in any particular Station to conduct all their duties in Irish if Irish was not also in use at the District Headquarters.Garda Districts in the Division of Galway West were approved by the Government for payment of the Gaeltacht allowance in 1934, followed by Garda Districts in the Divisions of Donegal and Kerry in 1935. No other Districts have been approved for payment of the allowance since that date.The arrangements for the payment of Gaeltacht allowances are among the issues being examined at present by an Interdepartmental Group on the use and promotion of the Irish language in An Garda Síochána, particularly taking into account the needs of Gaeltacht areas and the requirements of the Official Languages Act 2003. This Group consists of senior representatives of An Garda Síochána, my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. I expect to receive the report of the Interdepartmental Group shortly, and I will carefully examine whatever recommendations are made.

These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target. This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. The first group of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March and the second such group did so on the 8th of June. Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of Community Policing will be given the fullest consideration.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	767	I wish to advise the Deputy that the case of the person concerned falls under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003. Consequently, I wish to preface my reply by briefly explaining the workings of this Regulation.The Dublin II Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of 'asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one State. At the same time it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of 'refugees in orbit', a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, namely the Dublin Convention. Under the Dublin Convention, and now the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other State.The person concerned lodged an asylum claim in this State on 3 March, 2006. Following investigation, it was determined by the ORAC that, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, the United Kingdom was the appropriate State to process the application as the person concerned had previously been issued a visa in Islamabad on 12 September, 2005, to enter the United Kingdom, which was valid up to 9 March, 2006. He entered Heathrow Airport, London on this visa on 7 October, 2005.Article 9.2 of the Dublin II Regulation provides, inter alia, that 'Where the asylum seeker is in possession of a valid visa, the Member State which issued the visa shall be responsible for examining the application for asylum—'. The U.K. Authorities accepted the transfer of the person concerned pursuant to the terms of Article 9.4. of the Dublin II Regulation which provides, inter alia, that 'Where the asylum seeker is in possession only of one or more residence documents which have expired less than two years previously or one or more visas which have expired less than six months previously and which enabled him actually to enter the territory of a Member State, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply for such time as the applicant has not left the territories of the Member States.'The person concerned claimed asylum in this State using a different name and date of birth than that which appeared on his British visa document. The person concerned was offered an opportunity to appeal the determination of the ORAC, to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, but did not do so. The person concerned was kept informed of developments throughout the course of his asylum application in this State and was made aware as soon as it was possible to do so that his case came under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation.Following the acceptance by the United Kingdom of responsibility for the case of the person concerned, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of him on 7 June, 2006. This Order was issued to the person concerned on 15 June, 2006, requiring him to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, on 20 June, 2006, to make arrangements for his transfer to the United Kingdom. The enforcement of the transfer order is now an operational matter for the GNIB.In accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, the United Kingdom, and not Ireland, is responsible for examining the asylum claim of the person concerned. As a result, it is not my intention to grant the person concerned any period of leave to reside here. Given that the person concerned had been issued a visa to enter the United Kingdom and not Ireland, it is entirely appropriate that he be transferred to that State.

The provision of this information is complicated by two factors. Firstly, two data sources — the Irish Prison Service and the Garda National Immigration Bureau — must initially compile and then cross reference data from separate recording systems.

I can assure the Deputy, however, that there will be no unavoidable delay in providing the available information to him.

This funding was in addition to the ongoing funding that that organisation received for the provision of services to victims of crime. This funding was provided subject to the conditions that no funding beyond the year 2003 should be implied and audited accounts should be provided to my Department on a calendar year basis. To date, no audited accounts have been received in my Department.The Victim Support organisation received financial support from my Department from 1985 to 31 March 2005, during which period almost €5.5 million was made available.The Missing Persons Helpline operated from the headquarters of Victim Support alongside Victims Support's own helpline for victims of crime. The conditions under which the Department provided funding did not include any requirements concerning the operational activities of the Helpline, such as the strategy of the Helpline. Any decision relating to the operation of the Helpline were made by Victim Support which managed the operation of the Helpline in conjunction with the Helpline itself.As a matter of good practice in the handling of public money, my Department required that an independent evaluation of the Helpline should be undertaken after the first year of its operation and submitted to my Department. The operational details in relation to the evaluator and costings were a matter for Victim Support.In March 2005, I decided that continued funding of the Victim Support organisation could no longer be justified due to serious concerns in relation to governance, accountability for public funds and poor service levels, after a lengthy period of instability within the organisation. I understand that Victim Support closed down its headquarters operation during 2005 and that a number of staff were made redundant, including the person employed to operate the Missing Persons Helpline. My Department had no role in the decision of Victim Support to make a number of its staff redundant, other than to insist that statutory requirements (notice, holiday pay, etc.) be met and that the interests of the staff be protected.Also in March 2005, I established a new Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to devise an appropriate support framework for victims of crime into the future and to disburse funding for victim support measures. The Commission is entirely independent in its decision making and examines each application on its merits. The Commission received an application from Missing in Ireland Support Service for €71,600 to establish, staff and operate a helpline for missing persons. After careful consideration of the application the Commission decided to offer funding of €25,000. However, this offer was rejected by the Missing in Ireland Support Service. It should be borne in mind in this context that the Commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.It remains open to the Missing In Ireland Support Service to make an application to my Department for assistance if they so wish. I have been advised by the Commission that no request has been made to them by the Missing in Ireland Support Service to review the funding as allocated in 2005 nor for funding in 2006.The disappearance of any person is traumatic for their family and friends, and for this reason I am anxious to assist them in any way I can. I am of the view that a helpline for this purpose is best set up on an independent basis and by a non-official, voluntary organisation. Any proposals for funding for such a purpose which are made to my Department will be carefully considered on their merits.The Missing Persons Bureau in Garda Headquarters is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons. All cases of a person reported missing in suspicious circumstances remain open and under ongoing review and investigation until the person is located or, in the case of a missing person who is presumed drowned, a verdict to that effect by the coroner.At present, local Garda management take direct responsibility for missing person cases, and special investigation teams are appointed as necessary. All missing persons are recorded on the PULSE system. When a person is reported missing, the local Garda Superintendent will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, for example, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the Technical Bureau. The systems put in place by An Garda Síochána to manage and deal with reports of missing persons are in line with best international police practice, and Garda management have assured me that they are satisfied that the systems in place are adequate to deal with any reported case of a missing person.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the investigations into the whereabouts of missing persons are undertaken as part of normal duties and that separate cost entries are not established to track the cost of missing person investigations.An Garda Síochána interacts fully and as appropriate with all of the media outlets — print, radio and TV — in highlighting cases involving missing persons. The services of other external agencies such as Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in the investigation. In addition, every Garda District has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality. The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore, and is also a subject covered in in-service training.The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed. If their professional judgement is that some change in the existing legislation, protocols or structures would be of assistance in improving investigations, this would be considered by me.I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the number of untraced persons recorded at the end of 2005 was 395. I regret that it has not been possible in the time available to obtain the specific statistics requested by the Deputy. I will revert to the Deputy in relation to this matter when the information becomes available.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	782	The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. If the Deputy would like information on a particular school or schools, my officials would be happy to provide it.Major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. With the thousands of extra primary teachers appointed, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule at primary level. Primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes. Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, when the matter of why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade is looked into, very often the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it. Splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.

The project consists of the following: (1) The restoration & refurbishment of the original 19th century school building at St. Peter's National School, which is a protected structure; (2) The demolition of buildings to the rear of the retained building; (3) The construction of eight new classrooms, a special needs room, library, general purpose room and associated stores and toilets. The construction will also include a larger playground, retaining and boundary walls.A two storey temporary school building, located within the grounds of St. Peter's Church, Dalymount Road, Phibsboro and accessible from the North Circular Road has been provided for the pupils during the construction phase. The provision of the temporary accommodation is included as part of the overall contract for the project.Contracts have been signed and the Main Contractor has recently commenced works. The estimated project completion date is September/ October 2007.

The extent of service provided to these classes is a matter for the HSE and this information is not available in my Department.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	787	I propose to take Questions Nos. 453 and 454 together.In light of the reality that pupils in the high-incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of learning support/resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories.The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The logic behind having a general allocation model is to reduce the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments, and put resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. This will allow for better planning in schools, greater flexibility in identifying and intervening earlier with regard to pupils' special needs, as well as making the posts more attractive to qualified teachers.The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: It facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; it will automatically adjust a school's general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.This is a model for resource allocation to schools. These resources may in turn be allocated, as appropriate by schools to those pupils with special educational needs in the categories mentioned and to pupils with learning support requirements.Staffing levels under the general allocation model are allocated on the basis of the following categories of school: Larger schools: Differing pupil teacher ratios apply to boys' mixed and girls' schools; schools for boys with 135 pupils or more get their first post at 135; second post at 295; third post at 475, fourth post at 655, and so on. Mixed schools with 145 pupils or more get their first post at 145; second post at 315; third post at 495; fourth post at 675, and so on. Schools for girls' with 195 pupils or more get their first post at 195; second post at 395; third post at 595; fourth post at 795, and so on. All designated disadvantaged schools get their first post at 80; second post at 160; third post at 240; fourth post at 320, and so on.It should be noted that schools qualify for a pro rata part of a post for pupil numbers below the enrolment point for the first post and between the first and second post, the second and third post, and so on. Small schools: To ensure that small schools are not disadvantaged by the introduction of the general allocation model, the point at which smaller schools can appoint their first post is significantly reduced. For the purposes of the general allocation model, a boys' school is considered to be small if it has an enrolment of fewer than 135 pupils, a mixed school is considered to be small if it has an enrolment of fewer than 145 pupils, and a girls' school is considered to be small if it has an enrolment of fewer than 195 pupils.Small schools for boys will qualify for their first post at 100 pupils; small mixed schools will qualify for their first post at 105 pupils; and small schools for girls will qualify for their first post at 150 pupils. However, no additional general allocation will be made to small schools for boys on the basis of an enrolment between 100 and 135, to small mixed schools on the basis of an enrolment between 105 and 145, or to small schools for girls for an enrolment between 150 and 195.For the purposes of this model, my Department categorises schools that had an enrolment of at least 30 percent boys in the 2003/2004 school year as a mixed school with the allocations in accordance with the ratios for mixed schools above, otherwise the ratios for girls' schools is used. The ratio for schools designated as disadvantaged for the general allocation is 80:1 irrespective of the gender breakdown of the enrolment.Additional resource teacher support to schools in respect of pupils with low-incidence special educational needs are made on the basis of applications, supported by certain professional assessments and recommendations, to special educational needs organisers, officials of the National Council for Special Education.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	789	In my opinion, it is desirable that parents and the public in general have information about schools that is meaningful, fair and fully rounded. Data on school retention in respect of individual schools or local areas are not provided by my Department as these could be used to create statistical comparisons that take account of only one dimension of school performance and outcomes and do not adjust for the varying social and educational background of students entering these schools as well as the range of learning outcomes not captured in measures of examination performance or school completion. In the absence of a broader range of outcomes such comparisons could therefore impact in a negative way on schools in disadvantaged areas.It is my policy to facilitate the provision of the broadest and most meaningful information based on school performance through the progressive publication of school inspection reports at primary and post-primary level. My Department provides the funding for the education co-ordinators in Pobal who work with Area Partnerships throughout the country. They concentrate on target groups in need of alternative or supplementary educational supports and interact with RAPID co-ordinators to help bring a more integrated and co-ordinated approach to educational services for young people at risk of educational disadvantage. The Department will continue to work with the Area Partnerships to achieve the best possible educational outcomes for the communities they serve.

Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching time-table and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.The school in question applied for curricular concessions amounting to 6.6 whole time equivalent posts for the 2006/07 school year. My Department granted 6.33 whole time equivalent teaching posts and advised the school that, in the event of its not being satisfied with this allocation, it could appeal to the independent Appeals Committee. The school subsequently appealed this decision. However, the Appeals Committee decided that no further teaching allocation was warranted for the 2006/07 school year. The decision of the Appeals Committee is final. The total teaching staff allocation to the school for the 2006/07 school year is 65.14 wholetime equivalent teacher posts including an allocation of 5.84 wholetime equivalent teacher posts to cater for its pupils with special educational needs. Based on an enrolment of 781 pupils, this level of allocation leaves the school with an actual pupil teacher ratio of 11.98:1.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	801	I am providing the Deputy with the total expenditure incurred by my Department on both the purchase and rental of temporary accommodation for primary and post primary schools nationally since 1998. It is not possible to readily provide this information for years prior to 1998; or to provide the information in the format that the Deputy has requested.Nationally, between 1998 and the end of 2005, a total of €88.997m has been expended on the purchase of temporary accommodation for primary and post primary schools. This expenditure was for the supply and installation of prefabricated buildings including associated site works, and other costs such as for compliance with planning permission conditions, professional fees, connections for water, electricity and sewage. This represents less than 5% of the total expenditure on school buildings (€2.101billion) between 2000 and 2005. In the period since 1998 to the end of 2005, my Department spent €58.55 million on renting temporary accommodation for primary and post primary schools. This represents less than 3% of the total expenditure on school buildings between 2000 and 2005.The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new Gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools. The current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible, by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money.My Department has also used other innovative solutions to deliver urgently required permanent accommodation for schools in rapidly developing areas. An example of this is the new 16 classroom primary school for Griffeen Valley Educate Together National School in Lucan which was delivered through the use of a design and build contract within 13 months.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	802	I propose to take Questions Nos. 469 and 483 together.My Department's Inspectorate carried out an Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) which has recently been published and can also be accessed through my Department's website.This inspectorate report describes an evaluation of the education that is provided for children with ASD in a variety of settings nationwide. The elements of good practice identified during the evaluation process and in the literature review form the basis for the report's recommendations which will make a positive contribution to policy development and to the continuing improvement in the quality of education that is available to children with ASD. The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all children, including those with autism receive an education appropriate to their needs and in this regard my Department currently provides the following facilities for the education of children with autism: approximately 162 Special Classes for children with autism, attached to special and mainstream schools; 15 pre-school classes; 5 Special classes for children with Asperger's Syndrome; 12 Stand-Alone facilities providing an Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) specific methodology. The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/ special needs.My Department supports the education of individual students with autism in various second level schools throughout the country. The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. In general where a special class for pupils with autism is established by my Department though the number in attendance can vary as pupils attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.In addition, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally. My Department continues to develop and co-ordinate services between the SENO, the HSE and the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) in relation to multi-disciplinary support teams for children with autism.My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	803	My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs, including pupils with Downs Syndrome. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from the Department of Education and Science in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of the Department of Education and Science but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/ special needs.The NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs. The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following: Deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; Deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours; Processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.In the case of the school in question, 73.48 hours additional teaching support per week and 82 hours special needs assistant support per week have been allocated for the 2005/06 school year to cater for the special educational needs of its pupils, including the pupil to whom the Deputy refers. The NCSE has also confirmed that the school's resources for special educational needs will shortly be reviewed for the 2006/07 school year. The school will be notified directly by the SENO when the review has been finalised. My Department will continue to ensure that the necessary resources are made available for the education of children with special needs. I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require, when and where they require it.

To that end the School Books Grant Scheme may be used by school authorities for the support of book loan/rental schemes. In respect of the 2005/2006 school year, primary schools operating book rental schemes were paid €23.20 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and €31.20 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes.In respect of the 2006/2007 school year, primary schools operating book rental schemes have been paid €28.40 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and €38.10 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes. In respect of the 2005/2006 school year primary schools designated as disadvantaged that operated book rental schemes were paid €26.20 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and €36.20 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes. In the 2006/2007 school year primary schools designated as disadvantaged that operated book rental schemes have been paid €32.00 in respect of each eligible pupil in the infant classes and €44.30 for each eligible pupil in the 1st to 6th classes.An additional €0.5m has been made available under the School Books Grant Scheme in respect of the 2006/2007 school year to primary schools in the School Support Programme under DEIS. Schools participating in the SSP that indicate that they will operate a book/loan rental scheme in 2006/2007 will, in the case of primary schools, receive grant aid at a higher rate per eligible pupil than will apply in the case of schools generally and will, in the case of targeted second level schools, receive a seed capital allocation. The extra funding will be aimed at supporting the establishment, development and ongoing operation of book loan/rental schemes.The Seed Capital Grant for second-level schools is based on the number of needy pupils in the previous academic year as submitted to my Department under the School Books Grant Scheme. The returns for the 2005/2006 academic year are currently being processed and the rate for 2006 will be finalised shortly.

The Nationality requirement as set out in Clause 4.5 of the Vocational Education Committee Grant Scheme 2005 states that candidates must: hold E.U. Nationality; or have Official Refugee Status; or have been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; or be nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland. As the candidate referred to by the Deputy does not satisfy the nationality requirement I regret that she is ineligible for grant assistance under the grant Scheme.There are no plans at present to extend the nationality clause of the student support schemes. Any extension to the scope of the maintenance grants scheme, can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.

An approved course for the purpose of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full time postgraduate course of not less than one years duration pursued in an approved institution.The decision on eligibility for third level grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears that no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. The student referred to by the Deputy should request the grant application form from their local authority with a view to being assessed for grant assistance for the Higher Diploma Course.

The call for expressions of interest is a preliminary stage in a process that will eventually lead to the placing of contracts for the design and construction of accommodation for the 300 posts in my Department to decentralise from Dublin to Mullingar.The OPW has previously indicated to my Department a target date of Quarter 1 2009 for the completion of the construction of the accommodation for Mullingar. This timetable is contingent on a successful outcome to the tender competition which will follow on the call for expressions of interest, on planning permission being obtained and on no delays being experienced during the architectural planning and construction stages. While there has been some examination of the feasibility of relocating a number of the posts scheduled to decentralise to temporary accommodation in Mullingar in advance of the main move, no decision has been taken on this matter to date.

Special fees for repeat candidates were introduced in 1987 on the basis that it is not unreasonable to expect those who have already benefitted from the normal course of second level education, and who wish to take an extra year, to make a contribution towards the cost of providing the necessary resources. A course fee is also payable in respect of such candidates.Generally, examination fees cover only a fraction of the cost of running the examinations, and these costs have been spiralling in recent years as new methods of assessment are introduced in various subjects. There is an alleviation scheme in place whereby current medical card holders and their dependents are exempt from the payment of fees. This exemption applies to approximately 30% of all examination candidates each year. This alleviation scheme also applies in the case of repeat candidates in respect of both the course fee and the repeat examination fee.

In its submission to the Review Group, Tipperary Rural & Business Development Institute (TRBDI) included a proposal to develop a permanent campus in the planned Clonmel Technology Park (Ballingarrane Estate). The Report of the Review Group stated that the proposal, which involves the disposal of an existing property in Clonmel and the building of alternative facilities without incurring any Exchequer funding, has merit.In March 2005, my Department gave TRBDI approval to proceed with seeking expressions of interest from private sector property developers to determine what could be provided at Ballingarrane in exchange for the Institute's current property in Clonmel. The request for expressions of interest was advertised publicly in June 2005. An evaluation committee, set up by TRBDI to evaluate the expressions of interest, met on the 2nd June 2006. The evaluation committee reviewed the expressions of interest and a shortlist of candidates was drawn up. The Institute will now enter into more detailed discussions with each of the shortlisted candidates with the objective of identifying a preferred bidder.These discussions with the shortlisted candidates will represent a crucially important phase in this evolving process. Accordingly, it is not possible to specify the likely duration of these discussions. If successfully concluded, and a preferred bidder is selected, it is to be expected that still further and more specific discussions are likely to follow with the preferred bidder. It is at these discussions that significant points of detail including matters such as the appointment of a contractor, duration on site and associated issues shall be firmly resolved such that they can be incorporated into binding legal agreements.

My Department is using a generic repeat design for this project to facilitate the early lodgement of planning permission and progression to tender and construction as soon as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	817	The most recent information on class sizes for County Clare is for the 2005/2006 school year and is as follows:Classes of 19 and under — 1,890 pupils:Classes of 20 to 29 — 6,746 pupils:Classes of 30 to 39 — 3,116 pupils:Classes of 40 plus — 41 pupils.As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in primary school staffing in recent years. Next September there will no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002. Not only is the average class size in our primary schools down to 24, but there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level, including resource teachers etc.Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school. Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.As you know all schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children. Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007/2008 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. So, as I have pointed out the general rule in the current school year is that at least one classroom teacher is provided for every 29 pupils. Furthermore, the actual average class size nationally is 24.It is important to appreciate that there are a number of different reasons why a particular school may have a large class in a given year. Reasons why there are large classes include a significant fluctuation in enrolments from one year to the next and/or a decision by the school principal not to have multi-grade classes.Regardless of the reason why there is a large class in a particular school one year, it should be noted that in the majority of cases this is not the situation in the following year. In the main, the same schools do not have large classes year after year and so the same children are not in large classes year after year.Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is often because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes. Indeed, I often find that when I look into why a particular school has a class of 35 in a particular grade, the answer is because there is another class in the same school with a much lower than average number of pupils in it.I appreciate that splitting classes may not always be an option for a particular school, because for example there might be a large group in junior infants and a small group in sixth class and so on. But where it is possible, I believe that principals should consider the benefits of having smaller multi-grade classes as against having large differences in class sizes at different levels in the school.This Government has clearly demonstrated its commitment to improving staffing in our primary schools by hiring thousands of extra teachers in recent years and we will continue to make progress on this issue.

This recognition is contingent on the proposed accommodation meeting the criteria as set out in the Department's guidelines under the Criteria for the Recognition of New Schools. These criteria state that "In accordance with Section 10 (2) (e) of the Education Act 1998, the proposed interim accommodation complies with the Local Government (Planning and Development) Acts 1963 to 1996, the Building Regulations 1991 to 1997 (including the Building Control Regulations), the Health, Safety and Welfare Act, 1989 and any modifications, statutory instruments or orders made in accordance with these Acts."School Planning Section of my Department is of the view that the school has not, as yet met the accommodation criteria and this view has been communicated to the Patron of the school.There are three sites reserved for Primary schools in the Balbriggan area. One of these sites has been earmarked as the permanent location for Balbriggan Educate Together N.S. Ownership of this site is currently being transferred to my Department through Fingal County Council. Neither of the two other reserved school sites is in the ownership of Fingal County Council or my Department at present and no proposal has been received from the promoters of the new school regarding any of these sites.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	820	I propose to take Questions Nos. 489 and 491 together.As the Deputies will be aware, differing funding arrangements have evolved for the different school types at second level. At the core of all arrangements is a reliance upon capitation as the principle determinant of funding. There are however significant differences in the approaches to the funding of back-up services such as for secretaries and caretakers. Following on the Blackstock Report, which reviewed this area including the matter of equity of funding between the different sectors, a range of equalisation measures have been introduced that are designed to reduce the historic anomalies in the funding arrangements.In addition to the increases in the standard per capita grant that now stands at €298 per pupil from January last, voluntary secondary schools have benefited additionally by the introduction of grants under the School Services Support initiative. The standard support services grant that was increased to €107 per pupil from January 2006, now stands at €159 per pupil since January 2006 in the case of voluntary secondary schools. This equalisation measure of €52 per pupil for voluntary secondary schools, is paid in addition to grants of up to €15,554 per school. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.I am committed to improving further the funding position of second level schools in the light of available resources and to addressing the issue of equity highlighted by the voluntary school sector.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	821	Insurance costs for schools are entirely a matter for the managerial authorities of individual schools. My Department provides funding to primary and secondary schools by way of per capita grants, which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is in my view a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as insurance.There have been significant improvements in the level of funding provided to primary and post-primary schools. Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level has been increased from €57.14 per pupil to €133.58 with effect from 1st January, 2005 and has been further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1st January, 2006 bringing the standard rate to €145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level since 1997.At second level, the standard per capita grant, which stood at €256 per pupil in the school year 2001/02, has been increased by a further €12 to €298 per pupil from January, 2006. Under the School Services Support Fund initiative secondary schools will also benefit from further significant increases. The grant that was increased for secondary schools from €131 per pupil to €145 per pupil in January, 2005, has been increased by a further €14 per pupil to €159 per pupil from January, 2006. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils now receives annual grants of up to €270,000 towards general expenses and support services as against annual grants of up to €237,000 in 2002.These significant increases in the funding of primary and post primary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.

Section 1 of the Act provides for sections to be commenced at different stages.As I advised the Deputy previously, a sub-committee of the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, representative of both statutory and voluntary sectors, has been steadily progressing the groundwork, including the development of detailed guidelines and procedures, which are vital for the further rollout of the Act in a planned and structured manner. To date work has been completed on the following:1. Criteria for the Approval of National Voluntary Youth Work Organisations2. Criteria for the Designation of Local Voluntary Youth Work Organisations3. Guidelines for the Establishment of Voluntary Youth Councils.Work on other areas including Standing Orders for Local Voluntary Youth Councils, Terms of Reference for Youth Work Committees, and Criteria for The Authorisation of Organisations is nearing completion. The sub-committee is also addressing other provisions of the Act.It is my intention that the additional €2.839m secured in 2006 for the main funding line for the youth work sector will be used to develop the youth work service in a strategic manner and will include the progressive roll out of the Youth Work Act, 2001. The resourcing of VECs, including the appointment of Youth Work Officers, to carry out the functions set out for them under the Act has been agreed in principle by my Department and the IVEA. My Department is currently finalising the detail involved. This will be a significant step forward which will allow for the development of local youth work plans and ensure co-ordination of youth work programmes and services in the area with education and other programmes for young people.I identified the capacity development of voluntary youth work organisations to assist them in preparing themselves organisationally for the implementation of the Act as a priority for 2005. To this end I established a Development Fund to help ensure that youth work organisations can achieve the new standards for approval and engage effectively with the new structures arising from the Youth Work Act, 2001. Some 30 national and major regional youth organisations received once-off grants amounting to over €300,000 to help develop their ICT capacity in 2005. I am making similar funding available to national and major voluntary youth work organisations in 2006 and my Department is currently discussing priority areas for development with the various youth work interests.With regard to the roll-out of more services for young people, my Department is currently identifying priority areas for development and expansion in 2006. It is my intention to announce the allocation of funding to youth organisations and youth projects very shortly. The establishment of a National Youth Work Development Unit in the National University of Ireland in Maynooth will be a key element in the development of youth work. Its functions will include researching and developing guidelines for best practice in youth work and assisting youth organisations to implement same, as well as managing and coordinating research. Another new and important development is the imminent appointment of an Assessor of Youth Work. This post is viewed by all involved in youth work, both in the statutory and voluntary sectors, as an essential step forward.In addition, I would like to point out that my Department has secured an additional €2m in 2006 from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs which is responsible for the disbursement of Dormant Accounts (via the Economic and Social Disadvantage Committee). This provision will focus on small capital grants for equipment for local youth clubs and will complement my Department's existing Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.

The move will enable the Institute to provide better academic and support services for its nearly 20,000 students. It also has great potential to regenerate an underdeveloped area of the North Inner city.I recently appointed Mr. John Fitzgerald, City Manager, Dublin City Council as Chairman of the Grangegorman Development Agency and I am now actively considering the other appointments to the Agency. The general aim of the Agency is to oversee the Development of the lands at Grangegorman on behalf of the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Health Service Executive.The Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 provides for a total membership of 15 in the agency including the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer. There is no specific provision for a student or staff representative from the DIT.The legislation does provide that 2 ordinary members of the agency will be nominated by the President of DIT and it is clearly a matter for the President to determine who to nominate having regard to the functions of the agency set out in the Act and its governance role in relation to the development.The legislation recognises the student body of DIT specifically among the stakeholders that should be represented on the Consultative Group provided for in Section 22 of the Act. Up to 2 members of the Consultative Group can come from the student body.My officials recently met the President of DIT Students' Union and explained how the Consultative Group will give the stakeholders an opportunity to outline their views and participate fully in the Grangegorman development. The Act also provides for the Consultative Group to hold as many meetings as may be necessary to maintain an adequate communications strategy concerning the development of the Grangegorman site. The Consultative Group reports to the Chairperson of the Agency.As the Docklands (Rail) Development Authority is not under my remit I am unable to comment regarding appointments to that Authority.

The application is currently being assessed. A decision in the matter will issue to the school authority as quickly as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	827	There is no absence of a direct liaison between schools and my Department.The evaluation of all school policies, including a policy to deal with bullying behaviour, is part of the Whole School Evaluation process. WSE involves a full examination of all the varied activities of a school — from teaching standards to the availability of extra-curricular activities, the ethos of the school and the implementation of policies in areas such as bullying and health and safety. The inspection process also includes consultation with parents, staff members and students.I am acutely aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has in place a multi-faceted strategy to tackle the issue. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communication skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In Primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum in the Strand "Myself and Others" from Infant classes onwards. In Second-level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE Curriculum at Junior Cycle, in the Module on "Belonging and Integrating".Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. Recently, when I addressed the annual conference of the Irish Primary Principals Network, I asked school principals to ensure that effective policies are in place in their schools and that bullying is not tolerated in any way, shape or form.My Department, in its "Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in schools", has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school. My Department will keep these Guidelines under review with a view to updating them where necessary.In recent years, there have been a number of pilot programmes which have also addressed this issue. Pilot programmes are utilised as a means of informing possible new initiatives or how best existing provision may be improved upon. The function of pilot programmes is to test and evaluate different ideas and approaches in order to aid and enhance existing provision. Pilot programmes, when completed, are evaluated in terms of programme content, effectiveness and appropriateness and the recommendations and findings are considered in the context of developing existing programmes and structures which are designed to meet the needs of schools at local level.My Department also participates in an OECD "International Network on School Bullying and Violence". Sharing good practice and the most up to date approaches to addressing issues in this area is a key objective of the group.An effective framework is in place whereby schools are given guidelines and support in how to tackle bullying. I urge all schools to ensure that they have the procedures in place to deal with bullying so that all children can feel safe and happy at school.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	828	I propose to take Questions Nos. 499 and 500 together.The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in my Department. If the Deputy would like information on a particular school or schools, my officials would be happy to provide it.The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30th September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule. The staffing schedule for the 2006/07 school year is outlined in Primary Circular 23/06 which issued to all primary schools recently.Within the terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent Appeal Board is now in place to decide on any staffing appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department Primary Circular 0024/2006 which is also available on my Department's website.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	830	I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 to 504, inclusive, together.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including children with Down Syndrome. The precise level of support is determined by the special educational needs of the particular child.Children with Down Syndrome are entitled to additional provision in primary school, either under the terms of the general allocation system of teaching supports if the assessment places the child in the high incidence disability category or through an allocation of additional resources if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's circular.Children with Down Syndrome who have been enrolled in a pre-school are not precluded from being allocated special needs assistant support (SNA) in the primary and post primary school system. The need for SNA support is determined by the special educational needs organisers in the context of the criteria outlined in my Department's circular.The position at second level is similar in that my Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for pupils with special educational needs including pupils with Down Syndrome. The supports in question include learning support and additional teaching support, SNA support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.My Department's policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special educational needs into ordinary mainstream schools. The precise model of provision made available will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Pupils attached to these special classes at post primary level may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.Specific data in relation to the number of Down Syndrome pupils attending primary and post-primary schools nationwide is not available in my Department. Similarly, it is not possible to confirm the numbers of those pupils attending mainstream schools who are either integrated into mainstream classes or alternatively enrolled in special classes. As indicated above, the precise model of intervention is based on the assessed needs of the individual child. Pupils assessed as being Down Syndrome do not attend special classes specifically for Down Syndrome pupils. Rather it is the case that, if appropriate, they would enrol in a special class for pupils with an assessed general learning disability (GLD) e.g. a class for pupils with a mild GLD or moderate GLD.I am satisfied that the mechanisms are in place to provide appropriate resources for children with special needs in our schools, including those with Down Syndrome.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	831	I have previously indicated my willingness to make the facilities at St. Bricin's Military Hospital available to the public health service, in the event that the public health service would wish to secure access to these facilities.Representatives from the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Department of Health and Children visited St. Bricin's Hospital in 2005 to inspect the facilities. I inspected the hospital facility myself in late April 2005. The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive have given some very detailed consideration to the possible utilisation of the facilities at St. Bricin's for public health purposes. Following this detailed consideration, their view was that St. Bricin's was not suitable for use as an acute or sub-acute facility.Specialist engineering/architectural surveys carried at St. Bricin's in 2001 indicated that total capital expenditure in the region of at least €20 million (2001 prices) would be required to bring the entire St. Bricin's Hospital facility up to the standard of acute health board and public voluntary hospitals. While some upgrading work has taken place at St. Bricin's since 2001, the building overall, however, remains essentially un-modernised.The actual expenditure required for full upgrading and modernisation would of course depend on the nature of the intended use of the facility. Any such expenditure would be a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health and Children.Any future proposals for possible public health care use of the St. Bricin's facilities will be considered positively by me. My Department remains available to do everything possible to co-operate with the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive in that regard should such a consideration arise in the future.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government agreed on 16 December, 2003 to the release of circa 2.5 acres at St. Bricin's Military Hospital for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress affordable Housing Initiative. The legal formalities in relation to the transfer of the site at St. Bricin's Military Hospital to Dublin City Council are nearing completion.

Each City and County Council was invited to submit expressions of interest for grant assistance towards the provision of a skateboard park in its area. Applications were assessed in my Department in conjunction with the National Children's Office and some 21 projects in 21 different local authority areas were recommended for grant aid. A sum of €1 million had initially been earmarked for the scheme in 2005 but, in light of the number and quality of submissions received, I approved all 21 projects in November 2005 and increased the funding allocation to over €2 million which is expected to be spent over a two year period.Grants for skateboard park facilities are not provided by my Department directly to bodies other than local authorities.

To ensure that the public are well informed regarding the nature of the application, the newspaper notice must contain as a heading the words "APPLICATION TO [NAME OF THE RELEVANT LOCAL AUTHORITY] FOR A WASTE COLLECTION PERMIT RELATING TO ACTIVITIES IN [NAME OF RELEVANT LOCAL AUTHORITY AREA or AREAS]".I am satisfied that the requirement to include details in the heading of the newspaper advertisement both of the administering local authorities and the local authority within whose area the activity will take place provides clarity to the public as to the area(s) to which a particular permit application relates.The consideration of waste permit applications and the decision making process in relation to the granting of waste collection permits, as well as ensuring compliance with the requirements of the regulations, is a matter for the relevant local authority and my Department has no function in the matter.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	848	Under the Improvement Works in Lieu of local authority housing scheme, a local authority may improve or extend a privately owned house to eliminate defects or to provide additional accommodation where it is necessary to eliminate overcrowding or to accommodate a person not at present residing in the house. Persons benefiting under the scheme are required to pay a weekly or monthly charge calculated in relation to their means and the cost of the works carried out by the local authority. My Department is not aware of difficulties at local authority level in the operation of the scheme regarding the issue of the first charge on the property.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	849	The Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003, provide, inter alia, for the supply of specified documentation to Oireachtas Members by the local authority such as local authority budget, draft development plan etc. In addition, equivalent systems, procedures and timeframes to those used in relation to correspondence from local authority members apply also in respect of Oireachtas Members.As indicated in earlier replies to Questions on this topic, I am concerned that local authorities should at all times facilitate parliamentary representatives, in both the spirit and the letter of the regulations in relation to the timely provision of local authority documentation to members of the Oireachtas carrying out their work on behalf of local communities.My officials have been engaged in gathering information from local authorities on the practical application of the arrangements to date and arising from this, I will, if necessary issue supplementary guidance to local authorities taking account of the responses on the matter.

These floor areas and room sizes were re-examined and amended in 2002 in light of changes to Part M of the Building Regulations which require that all new dwellings be visitable by people with disabilities. These Design Guidelines along with the 2002 amendments are available on the Department's website at www.environ.ie. The Design Guidelines are currently under review and it is expected that draft revised guidelines will be issued shortly for consultation with a view to publication by end 2006.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	852	The principal statutes governing animal welfare are the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965. Responsibility for that legislation, including any proposals for amendment, is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food.My Department's functions relate to the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992. The main focus of these Acts is the control of stray and dangerous dogs, such as guard dogs, which could present nuisance or danger to the general public or to other animals. The implementation of the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 is vested in local authorities who have power, inter alia, to appoint dog wardens, to provide shelters for stray and other dogs, to impose on-the-spot fines for a number of offences and to take prosecutions. This legislation is kept under review in my Department.The report of a Working Group which was established to review the management of dog breeding establishments contained a number of recommendations including recommendations in relation to the introduction of statutorily enforceable standards for the dog breeding industry in Ireland and proposed the introduction of a registration system for dog breeding establishments. On 30 May 2006, I announced my intention to proceed with implementation of the majority recommendations of the Working Group. My Department will now, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and Food, develop the new system as quickly as possible. This process will include the development of standards for relevant dog breeding establishments and the drafting of new Regulations under the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	853	My Department understands that copies of the assessment reports referred to have not yet been made available to member states by the European Commission.The forthcoming Environment Council of 27 June 2006 will provide for an exchange of views on GMOs, including specifically on the role of the precautionary principle in the authorisation and risk assessment of GMOs and GMO products. The precautionary principle is already a central component of Ireland's national policy on GMOs; this policy is positive but precautionary based on the Report of the Inter-Departmental Group on Modern Biotechnology published in October 2000.The EU Commission has recently decided to introduce practical changes to the GMO approval process employed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to enhance the scientific consistency and transparency of GMO decision-making. These will include a requirement that the potential long-term effects of GMOs, as well as bio-diversity issues, are to be addressed more explicitly and with due regard to the uses of the product.The Commission's approach represents an attempt to bridge the different positions adopted by Member States. I also acknowledge the good work of the Austrian Presidency in organising expert meetings on co-existence and the precautionary principle as these apply to GMOs. Ireland broadly welcomes these developments as contributing to a better understanding among member states of these issues and a more transparent and consistent regulatory regime.

Mayo is in the ownership of Coillte. Any proposals for works there would be a matter for Coillte as owners and any limited grant assistance by my Department would be dependent on discussions with Coillte on the costs involved and an assessment of the future use to which the property might be put.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-06-20 00:00:00	Prelude	855	The Affordable Homes Partnership, established in August 2005, has been assigned responsibility for, inter alia, taking steps to bring forward additional land in the Dublin area for housing development, including land that, although not currently zoned for housing, may be suitable for that purpose. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has issued guidelines in relation to the exercise of this function by the Partnership; and further guidelines for planning authorities, designed to support the outcome of the Partnership's work on this initiative, are currently under consideration.The Partnership published advertisements in November 2005 inviting interested parties to come forward with proposals for the provision and development of lands mainly for affordable housing. I understand that the Partnership has identified a number of proposals which it considers would be appropriate from a planning point of view and is now engaging with the sponsors of these, with a view to concluding agreements which will secure the delivery of a significant affordable housing yield on the lands in question.It is expected that the Partnership will conclude this process in relation to a number of sites in the next few weeks and, where necessary, make recommendations to the relevant planning authorities in relation to any appropriate variations to their Development Plans that may be required. Decisions on the making of recommendations in relation to individual sites are a matter for the Board of the Affordable Homes Partnership. Decisions on any consequential Development Plan variations that may be required will be taken up by the planning authorities concerned, taking account of the relevant guidelines referred to above.

This programme is intended to address issues raised by the Commission on Electronic Voting (CEV) and demonstrate that the system operates reliably, securely and accurately.The programme includes the commissioning of a security and risk assessment of all aspects of the system (security measures and in-built protections of the voting equipment hardware and the integrated election software, a review of PC security and system hardening, and a risk analysis of the potential for internal or external interference) and the development of a programme of additional testing. The consultancy has been commissioned by my Department and, following an open procurement process, is being undertaken by Rits Information Security. The work to date has included liaison with officials from my Department, the CEV, Returning Officers, the Local Government Computer Services Board and the system manufacturers.
