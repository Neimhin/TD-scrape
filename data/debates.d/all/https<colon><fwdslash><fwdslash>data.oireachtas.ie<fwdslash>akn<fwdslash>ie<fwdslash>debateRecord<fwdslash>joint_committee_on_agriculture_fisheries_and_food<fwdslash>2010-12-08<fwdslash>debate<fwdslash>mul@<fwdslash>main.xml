          <p eId="para_10">On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Professor Gerry Boyle, who is the director of Teagasc, and Dr. Thia Hennessy, who is the head of Teagasc's agricultural economics and farm survey department.

          <p eId="para_11">Before I ask Professor Boyle to make his opening statement, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Professor Boyle to make his opening statement.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I thank the Chairman and the members of the joint committee for inviting us to attend this morning's meeting.  I understand that some members were anxious to hear from my colleague, Dr. Cathal O'Donoghue, who is the head of Teagasc's rural economy and development programme, which is based in Athenry.  Unfortunately, Dr. O'Donoghue had planned a vacation before he received the invitation to attend this meeting.  He sends his apologies.  Dr. Thia Hennessy, who is a senior colleague of Dr. O'Donoghue, is attending in his absence.  The committee secretariat has asked us to focus on four matters: the future of the Teagasc advisory service, the implications of the Food Harvest 2020 report, the area of artisan food and the poultry sector.  We will endeavour to deal with any other relevant issues members may wish to raise.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I begin by talking about the advisory service.  I have updated the numbers, and so on, for the committee.  At the end of 2008, Teagasc employed 340 permanent advisers and 65 fully funded contract advisers, most of whom were REPS planners.  The moratorium on public sector recruitment and the increase in the number of staff taking early retirement have had a significant impact.  We now have 271 permanent advisers working in our local area offices.  It is a significant reduction.  No contract staff are employed as REPS planners at present.  Therefore, we have lost 69 permanent advisers and 65 contract advisers since 2008.  Despite this reduction in front line staff, we have maintained our number of paid clients at approximately 44,000.  We continue to provide a reasonably high level of service to the entire sector.  I pay tribute to my colleagues, who have responded to the challenges associated with a substantial increase in workload by increasing their productivity.  As staff have left the service, their clients have had to be handed on to their colleagues who have remained.  It is fair to say the service is now under considerable strain, especially in some area units.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The figures for the years to come are of most concern to us at the moment.  Based on retirement at the normal retirement age, we estimate that the number of advisers will have declined to 237 - a reduction of 34 on current levels - by the end of 2014.  I do not mean to be alarmist, but there is real concern that this number could decline further to approximately 200.  It is possible that a significant number of advisers who are due to retire between now and 2016 could choose to retire before 2012.  I refer to people who have added years of experience as a result of their service in the county agricultural officer system.  As a consequence of the full pension entitlements they have as a result, they can retire before the end of 2012.  We have to try to deal with the emergence of this pressure on the service.  We have to plan for this scale of early retirement even though it might not happen.  While there is considerable pressure on the advisory service in all area units, the pattern of retirement is having a particularly adverse impact in some areas, including east Cork, west Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Kilkenny, which are among the most commercial farming areas in the country.  This pressure will be especially apparent in the spring, which is the time of year when commercial farmers have the greatest need for these services and a number of schemes have their deadlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I ask for the advice of the committee in one respect.  If the number of staff employed in the advisory service evolves as we believe it will over the next four or five years, it will have major consequences for the operation of the service and the level of service that can be offered.  In the short term, we are prioritising education and our service to commercial farmers.  This requires advisers to be highly flexible as needs arise.  As a result of the public service recruitment moratorium, we were recently unable to replace two teachers at the agricultural college in Mountbellew who became seriously ill at the beginning of the recent college term.  We had to juggle the advisory roles of eight advisers with teaching responsibilities to fill the vacancies in question.  That is not sustainable.  We are concerned that if similar problems arise in other colleges, we might not be in a position to put similar arrangements in place.  As a result, we will have to restrict student enrolment at a time of unprecedented demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">To relieve some of these pressures, we hope advisers from less pressurised areas can be relocated temporarily to advisory units that are under particular pressure.  This strategy will be feasible for a couple of years only, as many of the area units that are not under excessive pressure at present will face such pressures over the next three to five years as retirement kicks in.  We are also considering longer-term approaches.  We are considering how the advisory service's well-educated, trained and dedicated administrative staff could be used to ease the pressure on front line advisory staff.  As the committee is probably aware, demanding administrative requirements are associated with much of Teagasc's scheme-related work.  We are examining how administrative staff can take on some of that workload.  A pilot scheme is in place to that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">In the absence of a relaxation of the moratorium, or the addition of some flexibility to its operation, we will have to consider exiting from some activities.  The REPS workload will slacken substantially by the end of 2012 as we work through the remaining REPS clients.  If there is a significant level of early retirement in the interim, we will have to contemplate off-loading some of this work to the private sector.  In addition to REPS, advisers are heavily involved in servicing other scheme and regulatory requirements that are highly valued by farmers.  I refer to the single farm payment and the nitrates derogation plans and so on. We will have to consider transferring such work to the private sector if the moratorium is maintained rigidly in the medium term.  While it would be unrealistic to talk about removing the moratorium in the current circumstances, more flexibility is necessary in light of the needs of the advisory service.  We are conscious that if we off-load much of our scheme-related work, it could harm the technology transfer work being done.  If we have to off-load a substantial amount of our scheme support work, the impact of such work on the welfare of farm families could be severely damaged.  If farmers were to leave the Teagasc advisory service, they would lose a substantial amount of the support that is important in the context of farm incomes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_22">When one considers the projected figures for the period up to 2014 - not to mention the staff reductions which might or might not occur up to 2016 - the number of advisers employed by Teagasc will be reduced from 400 to 200.  The key issue here is that the moratorium is completely inflexible and does not allow for any organisations, including Teagasc, to remain within their budgets while retaining targeted recruitment plans.  The remainder of the presentation relates to the business potential of the agrifood sector, Food Harvest 2020, and so on.  If the agriculture industry is not to be supported by the Teagasc advisory service - in conjunction with, for example, Bord Bia and the National Dairy Council - in the context of marketing and selling its products, then progress will not be made and a void will be created.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The policy being followed must be reconsidered and should be replaced with one which allows for selective recruitment.  There should not be a blanket ban on all recruitment.  The current moratorium has implications for the advisory and education service which Teagasc provides.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Professor Boyle stated that the areas which are most under threat - from east Cork across Munster and into south Leinster - are those in which the greatest level of production occurs.  If the void is not filled, what will happen?  Will the potential of Food Harvest 2020 and the agriculture sector as a whole be realisable if Teagasc's advisory service is not working to its full capacity?  Will Professor Boyle indicate the minimum number of advisers that must be retained to ensure that the service continues to operate?  In light of the fact that certain schemes will be closed down or will come to an end, will it be possible for administrative staff, rather than advisers, to assist farmers in completing forms?  Would it be possible to allow such staff to do this so that advisers might be in a position to concentrate on their primary task?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_25">I thank Professor Boyle and Dr. Hennessy for coming before us.  There is a clear message being sent to the committee - via the statement presented by Professor Boyle - in respect of the advisory service.  The question that arises is whether a properly funded State advisory service should remain in place or a privatised model should be adopted.  A political challenge arises in that regard.  We must take cognisance of the fact that if we are to achieve the targets relating to Food Harvest 2020, a strong advisory service will be required.  Such a service is already in place at Teagasc.  As already stated, there is a challenge to be met and we must be aware of it.  The position is self-explanatory in that sense.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_26">I welcome Professor Boyle and Dr. Hennessy.  I find this matter alarming.  I come from an agricultural background and I am aware of the contribution Teagasc has made towards the development of agriculture and the education of those involved in the sector.  I have major concerns with regard to anything being sourced out to the private sector.  Farmers are hostage to the will of those involved in the public sector, from the point of view of cost as much as anything else.  I am particularly concerned by Professor Boyle's statement to the effect that when two teachers at Mountbellew Agricultural College - which is already under-staffed - fell ill, it was necessary to draft in advisers to provide cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">The Government and the Opposition face a challenge in the context of ensuring that Teagasc's advisory service, which has served the country so well, will be maintained and that there will be no diminution of it.  There must be no question of the service being subtly moved in the direction of the private sector.  I am sure most members have some connection to the agriculture sector and understand the role Teagasc plays.  I hope we can use our collective influence to ensure that the optimum level of service will be maintained so that those involved in farming will be in a position to obtain the advice and assistance they require.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NedOKeeffe" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Edward O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_28">I welcome Professor Boyle and Dr. Hennessy.  I am disturbed by what has been said in respect of the advisory service, which is independent.  The last thing that should happen is that responsibility for the provision of advice should be transferred to the private sector.  This is not a function of the private sector.  What is required is a public advisory service is funded by the State and paid for by farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Speakers referred to the embargo.  Long before the embargo was introduced, there was a policy or a hidden agenda to make cutbacks in this area and comments were made to the effect that the service was not cost-effective and so on.  When I attended agricultural college in the 1960s, an adviser was a jack of all trades and was involved in every aspect.  Now we have specialist advisers who deal individually with matters relating to dairying, pig farming, sheep farming, the growing of grain and other cereals, and so on.  The current service is quite different in nature and more productive than that which went before it.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">If the private sector becomes involved, it will provide advice on many other matters.  As already stated, we have an independent advisory service in place.  Certain private sector interests were involved in providing advice to certain farmers in recent years and they are now experiencing difficulties.  The private sector would promote certain machines, tractors, and so on, in respect of which people might receive concessions but which might not suit the needs of particular farmers.  The Teagasc advisory service is independent and those who provide it do not become involved in such activities.  If an adviser were involved in activities such as those to which I refer, I am sure Professor Boyle would dispense with his or her services.  Transferring responsibility to the private sector would give rise to an appalling state of affairs.  This was done in England a few years ago and England now has no advisory service.  That is a matter of some regret to everyone involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">Too much emphasis is being placed on production research.  Why?  Where is the payback in respect of such research?  Why is it not possible to transfer those who carry out such research into the advisory service?  I live near the Teagasc food research centre at Moorepark where some 800 cows are being milked in the interests of research.  Why in the name of God are so many cows housed at the centre when in the region of 200 would be sufficient for the purposes of research?  Deputy Doyle, some other members and I had hoped to visit New Zealand on the committee's behalf this year to discover how things are done there but we were not in a position to do so because money is scarce.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">There is an entirely new agenda in play and steps have not been taken to address that fact.  In his Budget Statement yesterday, the Minister for Finance indicated that agriculture had a good year and that it represents the way forward.  If we are to develop the agriculture sector and ensure that family farms are retained, then there must be an independent advisory service.  Discussion groups are all very well but they take up too much of the time of the advisory service, the members of which wish to concentrate on making preparations for farm visits.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">I request that this matter be addressed in an entirely new way.  Is Professor Boyle in a position to indicate what level of payback has been obtained in respect of production research, particularly in the context of what happens at farm level?  I do not believe he will be able to provide information in that regard.  For example, nothing much appears to be happening at Teagasc's research centre at Grange.  The Dutch were previously heavily involved in production research but I understand they are now moving out of it.  Consequently, this is a new scene.  I refer to east Cork, as could Deputy Sherlock, who knows a good bit about farming, and, in fairness to him, he has a good background in it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Edward O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_37">The Deputy and I are together on this point.  I come from east Cork, which is the most productive part of Ireland for agriculture.  To be told today that the advisory service there faces shortages frightens and worries me.  All forms of agricultural activities, including dairying, take place in east Cork and the service is being run down there.  At the same time, the dairy research unit at Moorepark is supposed to be the most innovative such unit in the world, even though I have been critical of the number of stock it has.  How much money is Teagasc spending on leasing land?  Why not transfer that into the advisory service?  Were I running the service, that is how I would do my business.  Teagasc has offices and many other things and there are many ways in which it could make savings to provide a proper advisory service.  There is an agenda whereby Teagasc does not believe it is productive and people in the Civil Service, perhaps in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, do not believe it to be productive, but that is far from true.  The programme recently launched by the Minister stated that agriculture would be developed into a new scene and this must be considered seriously.  If milk production is to be doubled or increased by 50%, assistance will be needed in an advisory capacity to farmers in a man-to-man approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I do not wish to be overly critical but research does not mean a great deal to me.  Where is the payback?  Where is the payback from the research centre located in my constituency?  What new food has come out of it?  Where have the new products gone?  Can the delegates indicate what companies have taken them on board?  Consequently, the expenditure of all that money does not strike me as being very productive.  I know the farming scene and never have had a private adviser on our farm.  I do not wish to boast but we do a great deal of farming and have used the advice of the Teagasc advisory service, of which I am very proud.  However, the only way to save the advisory service is to go back to the way it was 20 or 30 years ago.  The advisory service should be separated from the research and funded separately.  One then will find out what is cost-effective, who is making the money and who is losing it.  It was done in that fashion in the past.</p>

        <speech by="#BobbyAylward" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_39">I also welcome Professor Boyle and Dr. Hennessy to the meeting.  In common with other members I am alarmed by the figures presented.  I have the greatest of praise for Teagasc and appreciate the fantastic advice I have received at home in Mullinavat from the first day I went into farming up to now.  I am alarmed that from a starting point of 340 advisers on the permanent staff, the number has fallen to 271 with a possibility of it falling further to 200 advisers.  There is an onus on members of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to stop this.  All members agree with the moratorium and acknowledge there must be cutbacks in the present economic climate but there is a limit to how far one can go and maintain a service.  If the number falls to 200, it will not be possible for Teagasc to provide this service that will be needed for the future.  How will the Food Harvest 2020 programme be attempted in the absence of advisers or a system to implement it?  This will start with the advisory service and the research undertaken by Teagasc for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">I am alarmed that the number of advisers could fall to 200 were some of those who work for Teagasc to take early retirement.  The joint committee must ensure this does not happen.  No matter which party forms the next Government, whether it be my party or another, there is an onus on Members to ensure that a service can function properly.  This may mean lifting the moratorium when people retire.  A minimum number of advisers should be set, perhaps at 250 or whatever would be required, and the moratorium should work down to that number but thereafter people must be replaced.  The joint committee must deliver this message to the Ministers for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Finance, even in these stringent times.  Whatever cutbacks must be undertaken, one must not be permitted to go below a certain threshold of service that must be maintained.  I propose that the joint committee write to the Ministers concerned to request that the number of advisers should not fall below a certain figure, as no service would be available otherwise.  I seek members' support in this so that Teagasc can function properly and give the farming community the service it requires, especially in respect of its ambitions for  Food Harvest 2020.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_41">I apologise for my late arrival, which was due to other commitments, as I have not yet received the gift of bi-location.  I welcome Professor Boyle and Dr. Hennessy to the meeting.  It is a nice to attend a meeting at which a fellow county man is present as there may be some back-up for County Tipperary.  After a brief glance at the presentation, I note it mentioned agricultural colleges, which are of huge concern.  It is an ill wind that blows no good and the current recession has put the focus on agriculture, which now is perceived by many as the main hope to bring the country out of the mess it is in.  I recently spoke to the manager of Gurteen College, who told me that he could provide at least a further 100 courses there, had he the staff and facilities to so do.  While Gurteen College is a private institution, I am concerned about the cutbacks in budgets and the inability of agriculture to deliver such services to young people who cry out for such courses, which offer huge potential in this area.  What is the role of Teagasc in this regard?  In particular, what is its role in respect of the supply of teachers or advisers in this case?  A number of young people in my county were greatly disappointed when they were unable to secure a place there and the manager of the college has told me that he could deliver the courses, were he given the resources to so do.  Moreover, the resources involved would be minor as he stated he could make room for such students by converting part of the building but that there was a lack of staff to deliver the courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">In addition, I refer to the impact of Teagasc's budget on the provision of advisers on the ground.  Deputy Edward O'Keeffe continually blames Teagasc for not having a sufficient number of advisers on the ground.  I salute the outstanding work such advisers do in the form of giving classes to farmers to modernise their methods and keeping them in the picture.  Teagasc runs excellent courses that help farmers in many ways regarding the manner in which technology is developing and the way different schemes evolve for which applications must be made.  How are the cutbacks in Teagasc's budget affecting the service?  What is required to provide the level of service Deputy Edward O'Keeffe demands for farmers and to put Teagasc advisers on the ground to deal directly with farmers?  One is led to believe that Teagasc now is moving towards providing training courses to technicians who in turn will advise farmers.  Professor Boyle should indicate whether this is the route Teagasc is taking and whether this is its own policy or that of the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_43">I will deal with the comments as raised, if that is all right.  Deputy Doyle raised a number of points that also were picked up by other members.  A significant number of the 340 advisers who were employed in 2008 were involved in REPS planning and as the REP scheme is being wound down, I would distinguish that work from the traditional work of advisers.  It is important to make that point and to put it in context.  I greatly regret that Teagasc was obliged to let go a number of good and dynamic young REPS planners, but this is something to be borne in mind in respect of the workload.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">Deputies Doyle and Aylward picked up on the question as to the optimum number of advisers.  The concern of Teagasc is that a policy driven by the moratorium and retirement is a policy of drift because one will run to stand still.  There would be merit in looking first and foremost at the politically determined need for the service.  The political system must decide what is wanted or required from the service and then, having done that, the resources that are needed and the efficiencies that are required would follow from it.  It is very difficult to answer the question as to the optimal number of advisers unless one has a clearly articulated view on the level and nature of the service needed.  Such a dialogue would be highly useful because it may well lead to an outcome like that suggested by Deputy Aylward of agreeing that the numbers cannot fall below a certain critical level if there is a commitment to deliver on a certain level of service.  I perceive the numbers issue as being important but subsidiary to the most important question, which the type of service sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Deputy Sherlock raised the issue of the privatised model.  We have enough experience from the UK to know that its decision to go private was a disaster, which is well appreciated by all commentators in the UK.  We are fortunate in Teagasc in that in recent years we were able to recruit those who came from that service.  We have first-hand knowledge of what happened there.  The privatised service fulfils a niche requirement but is a very different type of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">Typically, one will see the private service engaged in activities such as advice on tax and planning permission, which have very little to do with advising farmers on technology or giving them independent advice.  I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that the value of the service has been the fact that we tried to maintain independence continuously.  Farmers have been bombarded on every side on the merits of particular products and so forth and appreciate independent advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">An area which has proved to be very important in recent years is the environment.  Advisers are appreciated for the technical and complex advice they give in that area, which is becoming more complex.  In regard to the private model, we have to be sensible and see that there are opportunities for public private partnerships.  There are certain tasks the private sector is better able to do and tasks it will not do.  Determining the overall level of service requires that some relationship be identified whereby we could work in harmony with the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Deputy O'Keeffe raised these matters with me before in regard to research and I am very familiar with them.  I appreciate his strong support for the advisory service and I agree with everything he said.  I disagree with him completely, which will not come as a surprise to him, in regard to his comments on research.  I wrote a book on the returns to research.  Of all of the investment in the knowledge economy, there has been more written and published on the quantifiable returns on research than on any other area.  I can give the Deputy countless examples of research on agriculture and food.  Overall, the payback in terms of an internal rate of return which is published in peer-reviewed journals is 44%, which has been verified by scientific studies.  Within Teagasc we identified several areas.  The most recent, which has gone under the radar, are the benefits from genomic selection.  We were the second country in the world to introduce it in dairy cows.  The cost of the research, in conjunction with our colleagues in ICBF, was approximately €1 million.  We estimate the payback to be in the order of €8 million for the dairy sector and if that was extended into beef, as it is hoped it will be over the next few years, the payback could be tripled.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Another very good example of payback is the work we have done on potato breeding.  It is a very real return because it depends on the royalties we generate from the sale of potato varieties.  The Chairman and committee will be aware of the varieties that have been produced at Oak Park by Harry Keogh, who has now retired, and his colleagues.  The Rooster brand is the most significant and the Cara is another.  All of those continue to generate royalty streams and the payback is evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Other examples of the work done in Oak Park is the sowing date of spring barley, where we identified substantial gains in yields by bringing forward the sowing dates.  Examples from Moorepark of work done on milking machine liners showed benefits not alone in terms of mastitis reduction but in terms of milk yield.  I could go on and on.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Food is an interesting issue.  Deputy O'Keeffe will be aware that recently we had the very welcome announcement of the Danone investment in Macroom in infant food formula.  I extend an invitation to all members of the committee to visit Moorepark because it has state-of-the-art facilities in regard to infant milk formula.  Ireland is currently exporting 16% of the world requirements and Moorepark research is playing a very important role in production and technology. We were involved in the background with Enterprise Ireland for more than a year promoting Macroom.  I would like to think we played a significant part in persuading Danone that we had the technological capability to support not just it but more importantly Irish dairy companies such as Dairygold and others which supply ingredients.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">I may seem to be biased towards Cork but the best example I could get, which is not the only one, of where our food research has delivered real dividends is our involvement with the Carbery Group.  The classic Dubliner cheese product was developed by Moorepark scientists in collaboration with others.  There are several other examples.  As far as I am concerned there is evidence of payback, which is not just idle talk on my part.  The evidence is backed up by peer review journals.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Equally complimentary to research are advisory services, and we have done the same level of analysis.  My colleague, Dr. Hennessy, has examined the impact farmers get from contact with the advisory service and we can demonstrate the payback.  We track it continuously in our surveys.  We investigate and correlate the income generated on farms with farmers that are involved with advisory services.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">Discussion groups were mentioned.  We have 6,000 farmers involved in dairy discussion groups, which is a phenomenal number.  Many have come in under the new scheme.  We have examined the benefits farmers get from discussion groups.  Dr. Hennessy quantified it in euro at a recent dairy conference and there is a real benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Will the committee to consider what has happened this year, which was the first year of the scheme.  The number of dairy farmers - I can refer to my area of the country which is a very difficult dairy farming area - who became involved in discussion groups started taking on technology that they would never previously have considered.  One very good development concerns the re-seeding of grasslands.  It was a good year, which I accept, but I have no doubt it was influenced in part by the involvement of discussion groups and the role of Teagasc in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Deputy Coonan raised important issues in regard to the Teagasc educational service and referred specifically to Gurteen College.  I probably had representations from the people who contacted the Deputy in regard to admission to the college this year.  There was excess demand for places and I regret very much that we had to turn down 250 applicants, which is something we never had to do before, purely because we did not have the teaching staff to accommodate the students.  The reason is very simple; it is not a policy of Teagasc, rather, it is the moratorium.  We cannot recruit staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">Even if we could create the resources to recruit staff it is still not the issue.  In other words, if we identified other savings, which we continue to do throughout the organisation, we cannot use those resources to recruit teachers or other advisers.  That is the impact of the moratorium and is something I emphasise.  If we were to get external funding for teachers from a generous co-operative or company which said it wanted to support a particular college and subvent a number of teachers we would not able to recruit staff under the moratorium.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Private colleges are in a particularly difficult situation, something which I discussed previously at the committee.  Most of the teachers that work in those colleges are not Teagasc staff, that is, public employees.  They are employees of the private institutions that own the colleges.  They are subvented by Teagasc and their pensions come out of the Teagasc grant in aid.  Therefore, we cannot require them to move location or change role, as we can with our staff.  They have a particular difficulty which is compounded by the fact that if a college such as Mountbellew loses teachers through early retirement, illness, maternity leave or whatever, we cannot hire a teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">It is also very difficult for us to transfer staff from the advisory service into those colleges because it takes away from the service.  It also creates complications that could arise subsequently in regard to the so-called transfer of undertaking legislation.  We have been strongly supported by the Department in these difficult situations.  Yesterday's outcome in regard to our budget is recognition of the contribution Teagasc has made and is making.  The biggest difficulty we are facing is in dealing with the moratorium on recruitment.  I am not for a minute suggesting that, in the current circumstances, that can be fundamentally changed - and I would not argue for that - but there is a big difference in an organisation which depends on specialists to deliver a service and an organisation whose dependency is on general staff or administrators who can be more flexibly moved around the system.  For example, last year we lost our plant pathologist through retirement.  One cannot say to somebody else that he or she should become a plant pathologist - no matter how good a researcher he may be.  If one does not have a plant pathologist, one cannot have an effective advisory service on cereals either.</p>

          <from>Dr. Thia Hennessy</from>
          <p eId="para_65">I will speak about the research we have conducted in Teagasc to look at the feasibility of meeting the food harvest targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">As members will be aware, the three high level targets set out in the Food Harvest 2020 report are to increase the value of primary output in the agriculture sector by €1.5 billion, about 33%, from the average level in 2007-09, which was a poor period; increase the value added by €3 billion, 40%, and achieve an export target of €12 billion, an increase of 42%.  These high-level targets are broken into specific targets for the different farm sectors.  In dairy, the target is to increase milk production at farm level by 50% from the 2008 level to 2020, following the removal of milk quotas; in the beef and sheep sector, to increase the value of output by 20% - values in the form of value added as well as increased actual output; in the pig sector, a 50% increase in value of output; and in poultry, a 10% increase in the value of output.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Teagasc research to date has focused on three key issues: the feasibility of growing the dairy sector by 50% by 2020; the environmental implications of achieving all the Food Harvest 2020 targets in terms of our commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and the value of growth in the agri-food sector for the wider economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">Recent figures indicate there are approximately 18,000 dairy farmers actively supplying milk in Ireland.  During the past ten years, numbers have declined by an average of 3% to 4% each year, usually due to retirement and non-succession, economic reasons and so on.  We have good reason to believe this pace of structural change will continue between now and 2020 and may accelerate somewhat when quotas are removed, but decline subsequently, and average out at 3% over the next ten years.  It is important to bear this mind when talking about expanding the sector.  If the population of dairy farmers declined by 3% each year we would be left with approximately 13,000 in 2020.  The targeted growth in terms of expansion is based on a higher productivity output per cow of about 2% per annum.  That would be an improvement in productivity over what has been achieved during the milk quota period.  There will be increased stocking rates on existing farms.  The 13,000 farmers could increase the national output of milk by about 17% but each individual farmer is increasing production by an average of 65%.  Based on the existing population of farmers and those likely to be lost in the next ten years national production would increase by about 17%.  To achieve the targeted growth of 50% a significant number of new entrants will be required.  For existing farmers, access to additional land adjacent to their current facilities will be important.  Expansion beyond their current capacity in terms of investment in housing and milking parlours would have to be cost effective and the uptake of technology, especially output enhancing technology, improvements in productivity per cow, will be key to achieving the 50% target.  That is a good follow-on from the previous discussion.  There is a need to return to higher productivity gains than 2% per annum per cow to achieve the 50% outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">On the environmental consequences, as members may be aware Ireland is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 relative to the 2005 level, although no specific targets have yet been set for agriculture.  In this example, we assume that agriculture would have to reduce by 20% by 2020, relative to the 2005 level.  Since 2005, Ireland has reduced greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture by about 8%, driven mostly by a decline in the suckler cow herd.  If the Food Harvest 2020 targets were to be achieved we would regress to our 2005 position, in other words 20% over the limit of where Ireland should be by 2020 under this environmental policy.  If we had a continuation of current policies or if the Food Harvest 2020 targets were not met, the levels would be between 10% and 12% lower than those for 2005.  It is important to bear in mind how we can achieve the targets set out in the Food Harvest 2020 report while meeting our commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">If all the Food Harvest 2020 targets were achieved, agricultural income would increase in the sector by 50% between 2008 and 2020.  The actual value of extra output from the sector would be €1 billion.  We are aware from previous studies that the multiplier effect on this is about €1.5 million; therefore, the wider economy effects in terms of the benefits upstream for input suppliers and downstream for food processing are about €1.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">In the food processing sector the targets, if achieved, would mean an increase in value added of about €1.4 billion.  This has a higher multiplier effect of €2.2 million so that the wider economy benefits would be €3.2 million.  This results from increased employment through the processing of additional milk and better value added in terms of products being produced from the beef and sheep sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">That is a summary of the research we have conducted to date in achieving the food harvest targets.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_23">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_73">It is great to see a document that summarises what can be achieved and what needs to happen on a page.  To achieve 50% growth by 2020, new entrants will have to come into the market and there will probably be conversions by people in other areas of production at present.  It will also probably involve dairy farmers only milking cows, and dry heifers and some feed will be produced off farm, either on leased lands or through some partnership arrangements with people who, heretofore, may have been dry-stock farmers.  It will have implications, however.  We do not need to go there, but we must be aware of disease control and other such issues.  With regard to greenhouse gas emissions, we should concentrate on growing the agricultural output by 50% and consider how we can mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions that will occur, regardless of the targets.  This committee has been involved in producing a paper on forestry, and the use of forestry in calculating the mitigating effects it has on the current and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  Forestry will have to come into the picture.  Enterprises such as dairy or off-dairy farming will piggyback on research, and both beef and cereal production have benefited from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">I know that marketing is not Teagasc's role directly.  The role of Teagasc is intertwined with that of Bord Bia and the Irish Dairy Board.  These bodies, in particular, have to go out and get the markets.  Professor Boyle mentioned the investment Danone has made in Macroom and this highlights exactly the sort of initiatives that need to be taken.  Mr. Lane said recently that there is no point in producing more if one does not have a place to sell it.  The markets are out there, but it is a matter of going out and finding them.  Bord Bia produced and published ‘Pathway for Growth' for Ireland's food sector and one of the points it makes is that Irish exporters should be encouraged to collaborate rather than compete, as there is no point in three different bodies going out and selling three different cheeses to the one supermarket chain in Spain or any other market when we should work in "co-opetition".  I welcome this strategy.  This report will work as an implementation plan to grow the business.  This is exactly what is needed.  I would hate to see environmental issues being seen as an excuse not to grow the industry.  We should look outside the box to allow the growth of 50% be achieved and then deal with the green issues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_75">This is what I call progress.  From our perspective we are beginning to drill down into the Food Harvest 2020 report and recognise the challenges facing us arising from it.  As we see it, we have set ourselves political targets which in themselves present serious challenges.  The challenges have been summarised, but the question that comes to my mind relates to the improved restructuring of land.  From the research I have carried out, the number of farms has decreased from 223,000 in 1980 to 170,000 in 1991 to 128,000 in 2007.  The average farm size has increased to 32.3 hectares.  If we are to achieve the economies of scale necessary to achieve the targets, then obviously, as stated in the submission, there must be an improved restructuring of land.  The question that follows is whether there is recognition by farm owners or land owners as to the need to restructure the land.  If that restructuring is to take place, how will it take place?  Will it take place through farm partnerships or some type of collectivisation?  I do not mean that in a loaded political sense of the word.  Are we talking about people selling their holdings to achieve those economies of scale?  Will the traditional family farm - which is an emotive term - as we know it cease to exist to achieve those targets that are necessary?  The next question is how does one get farmers to take up new technologies to achieve the efficiencies and the returns that are necessary.  If the demographic is older and the age profile is older now, how do we achieve a greater throughput of younger farmers who are more inclined to taking up the challenges than the more traditional farmers?  Perhaps I am wrong - perhaps older farmers are more open minded to scientific knowledge.  My perception is that the older one is and the longer one is in the sector, the more traditional is the individual's output and the less likely one is to take on board new technologies to improve one's holdings.  There are a great many challenges.  What I am driving at is whether there is a view in Teagasc as to how these targets can be achieved in practice.  What is the political input and what decisions need to be taken by policy makers with a view to achieving these targets?</p>
          <p eId="para_76">I am a regular reader of the Teagasc magazine <i> Today’s Farm.</i>  I find it invaluable and the T research document that comes out on a regular basis is invaluable as far as I am concerned.   In one article on greenhouse gases in the current edition where Mark Gibson, the environment specialist in Athenry talks about the international research.  He states that international research has established that the fairest and most accurate way of measuring greenhouse gas emissions is on a per unit product basis so that for example total greenhouse gas emissions from a litre of milk or a kilogramme of meat by reducing the carbon footprint of our produce would enable all countries to compete on a level playing pitch and work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions from global agriculture.  If I track back from there as a layman, the question is what research is going on, how is the multidisciplinary internal working group working at the moment to achieve those targets and is there something concrete arising from it that will feed into the end game or the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020,  to which we all subscribe at some level.  Greenhouse gases, as far as I am concerned, are one of the major challenges and I know there is a great deal of work going on in Moorepark on that issue.  That is well recognised and well established.  The question is whether we will achieve the targets and where are we scientifically in that sense.</p>

        <speech by="#BobbyAylward" eId="spk_25">
          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_77">We have had two presentations, the second of which goes to show the importance of a good functional agricultural service.  The first presentation set out what was needed and the second presentation set out how to meet the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 report.  We need an agricultural service and we need people to conduct research.  The argument was proved by the second presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">Will Teagasc still be involved in the AEOS scheme?  I know that REPS 2 and 3 are finished but REPS 4 is still alive.  The AEOS scheme is still ongoing so Teagasc will need manpower to give advice and fill out forms on the AEOS scheme.  We got a guarantee yesterday that the 10,000 farmers leaving REPS 3 will be allowed into the AEOS scheme at a cap of 5,000.  That is good news for the future viability of the farm family.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">I will now comment on the targeted increase of 50% in dairying and the 20% increase in beef and sheep and 10% increase in poultry, that is our great ambition.  I had an opportunity in recent weeks, in particular, to meet many farmers because of the budget.  I met representatives from the IFA, ICMSA and Macra na Feirme.  The downturn in the economy presents a golden opportunity for the future viability of farming and improvement in farming.  Young people who would have moved away in the past ten years, are looking at farming, .  When the building industry was booming they looked in that direction for reward.  Now that the building industry has died, they are looking at farming again.  There is potential to increase output and meet the targets that have been set out in the document.  I honestly believe that with the abolition of the CUIS system in 2015, Ireland has a golden opportunity to reach these targets, because we produce natural grass.  The population of the world is increasing.  It is predicted that it will grow by a further 1 billion in the next 20 years.  I am not sure of the exact numbers.  We have an opportunity to meet the demand for quality food to be produced to a certain standard.  We are doing that in Ireland and we can improve it.  There is a golden opportunity for young farmers to get these enterprises up and running.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">I agree that the family farm will not disappear.  It is the backbone of Irish agriculture and will be for years to come.  Perhaps we will see fewer small farms.  The average farm size will continue to rise.  The average farm is now more than 30 hectares, or approximately 80 acres.  There will be more bigger farms.  The tradition of handing farms down from father to son, or from mother to daughter, will continue.  The family farm needs to be supported because it drives agriculture here.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">On the question of greenhouse gases, like Deputy Doyle, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  It will be problematic to marry the increase in production in the cattle sector with the need to decrease greenhouse gas emissions.  Afforestation is one way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Some 7,000 hectares are being planted each year.  There is talk of increasing that figure to 15,000 hectares within a couple of years.  Ireland's farming output should continue to be grass-oriented.  I accept the annual target of 15,000 hectares, but that is the maximum we can achieve.  How can we marry the need to increase the production of milk in the cattle sector with the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the next ten years?  I appreciate that such a target has been set, but how can we marry one with the other?</p>

          <p eId="para_82">This is something of a mixed bag.  The targets set are exciting.  Glorious opportunities are presented by the increase in the world's population.  The document furnished by Teagasc predicts that over the next five years, the number of dairy farmers will decrease by 5,000.  That raises the question of the future of the family farm, which was discussed by Deputy Aylward.  Just as I was never really convinced that the Kilkenny hurling team could not be beaten-----</p>

          <p eId="para_84">-----I am not convinced that family farming will continue if family farms are not given the help they need.  It is all about incomes.  These targets are exciting and the opportunities are great, but they are no use if farmers cannot derive from them an income off which they and their families can live.  I would like to hear more about incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">I am a little concerned about the need to achieve a balance between making land available for food production and making it attractive to use for alternative energy and bioenergy.  Do the delegates see a conflict here?  It might not be right to use the word "conflict".  Perhaps we can be given an idea of Teagasc's research into alternative energy.  I refer, for example, to the conversion of wheat or sugar beet into ethanol.  Land prices have rocketed in my local area because people are buying up grass to convert it into a source of heat, using anaerobic digestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">I am concerned about the future of the forestry sector, which was mentioned by another speaker.  Forests are being planted on good land that should be used for top-class food production but instead is being taken out of the system.  The amount of land that can be used for food production is a finite raw material.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Do Professor Boyle and Dr. Hennessy envisage that genetically modified foods will play a role in the achievement of the targets mentioned?  Is genetic modification on the agenda?  Has it been brushed aside?  What are the positions of the Department and Teagasc on genetically modified crops?</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I do not want to go back over old ground by speaking at length about the need for farmers to take advantage of the opportunities presented by modern technology, which has a role to play in increasing production.  Are incentives being offered to encourage farmers to avail of education and training in modern technology?  What is the current role of farm apprenticeship schemes, which were of excellent value at one stage?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NedOKeeffe" eId="spk_29">
          <from>Deputy Edward O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_89">I welcome Dr. Hennessy's presentation.  I will speak first about greenhouse gases.  If we increase the number of bovine animals to the level that has been suggested, there is not an answer from a greenhouse gas perspective.  When I discussed this matter with a Dutch farmer who visited my farm recently, he told me the Dutch authorities are overcoming this problem by raising concentrate feeding and getting higher yields from their dairy cattle.  He could not see any way we could have the proposed livestock numbers without making our greenhouse gas problem worse.  The expenses of dairy farmers may also increase.  At present, a huge cost factor is associated with the cereals sector.  I understand the price of soybean has increased to €400 a tonne.  What is the future for genetic modification in Ireland?  Where do the delegates think it will go?  What kind of research have they done on that?  It is all related to what we are discussing.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">While I welcome the debate on the dairy industry, I am concerned that the industry here is too commodity-based.  All we have in the cheese area is white and red cheddar, mainly.  We have to look at what other countries are doing.  The Dutch authorities send ships and ferries across the North Sea to the UK every day of the week.  They are marketing their dairy industry and their bacon products to the 4 or 5 million people who live in the greater Manchester area.  We have a long way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">I mention another frightening thing.  Ireland should not pursue a model of agriculture being promoted, which involves herds of 500 or 600 cows.  I strongly support my colleague, Deputy Aylward, who pointed out that the more farmers who benefit from the land, the better it is for everyone.  I can explain clearly how that argument is supported by the Constitution.  I should let it be known, in case people think I am saying otherwise, that I milk a substantial number of cows.  I am making the point that I do not envy those who are milking 50 or 60 cows.  They can make a substantial living as long as their bank borrowings are not above a certain level, which can happen.  There is a great deal of work to be done in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">Deputy Sherlock spoke about land.  We will have to look at long-term leasing as the way forward.  We do not have any legislation in that area.  There is no protection for either side.  That has to be considered in a legislative context.  It is a matter for the parliamentary counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">I welcome what the delegates have said.  There is no added value in the pig industry.  It is all commodity-based.  There are no jobs there.  Jobs have to be related to any expansion.  I have always believed that we have to look after the people in the other sectors as well.  I come from a background in which we always looked after them.  My family has always been involved in farming and outside the farm gate.  I have to admit the number of jobs in the beef area will not increase.  One cannot do much with it as a commodity.  Dairying, pigs and poultry are fantastic areas for job creation.  Commodities are no good to the 400,000 people who are unemployed during this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Rural towns throughout the country had huge industry based on agriculture and food.  It is all gone, for some reason.  It is not gone because it was not productive, or because people did not want to eat the food that was produced.  It happened for some reason.  When I look at the north Cork area, I get sick and tears are brought to my eyes as I am reminded of what has happened there.  The whole food industry, with the exclusion of the sugar company, was based there.  We had added value in the cheese and bacon industries.  There was a huge number of jobs, but they are all gone.  We have to get back to where we were.  I know there is a capital requirement.  Work has to be done in that area.  There is no point in increasing milk production if it does not benefit our community and our people.</p>

          <from>Dr. Thia Hennessy</from>
          <p eId="para_95">Deputy Doyle outlined his concern that the limits relating to greenhouse gases would curb our ability to increase production.  In the context of the implications relating to greenhouse gases, we must consider the current level of technology and the standard coefficients that are applied in respect of animals in the context of the amount of such gases they emit.  A large research programme is ongoing within Teagasc in respect of the actions farmers can take to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions per cow.  Such actions include lengthening the grazing season, using grass better in the diet of animals, and so on.  The problem in this regard relates to how this can be measured at an aggregate level.  This is a matter for policy makers rather than anyone else and work must be done in respect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">I will be obliged to ask Professor Boyle to provide clarification but I understand that any gains which may be made in forestry in terms of carbon sequestration may not accrue back to agriculture.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">Deputy Sherlock referred to the actions required to improve access to land.  Mechanisms such as partnerships would be extremely useful but, to date, the uptake in respect of them has been quite limited.  We must wait to see whether greater incentives will be provided, whether quotas will be removed, and so on.  This will be extremely important because when one examines the analysis in the context of where the expansion potential lies, it is obvious that it is concentrated regionally - in the south and south east - and is focused in the area of dairying.  The competition for land will be greatest in the south and south east.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">As Professor Boyle stated, we have considered levels of technology adoption in discussion groups.  When one examines the position of discussion group members against that of those who are not members, it is obvious that the level of technology adoption is much higher among the former.  I refer, in particular, to the adoption of new technologies such as those which utilise genomic selection for artificial insemination.  What is interesting about the discussion groups is that even before any financial incentives were provided for participation, farmers of all ages were members of such groups.  While the Deputy is correct to state that, traditionally, older people are less likely to adopt new technologies, the discussion groups are targeting the full spectrum of farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Deputy Aylward referred to the great enthusiasm among young farmers in respect of entering the dairy sector and growing family farms.  We must be conscious of and stress the importance of cost-effective investment in the sector.  The dairy sector has become extremely volatile in recent years and this position will become worse in the future because the price protection supports that were previously in place are no longer present.  The average income on dairy farms in 2007 was €51,000.  This fell to €22,000 last year.  In the space of two years, therefore, incomes have more than halved.  That is an important consideration with regard to investment in future expansion.  I will ask Professor Boyle to reply to the question relating to Teagasc's position on genetically modified foods.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">Deputy Ned O'Keeffe referred to how the greenhouse gas issue might be circumvented through the use of cows with higher outputs or by increasing productivity per animal.  It should be borne in mind that the greenhouse gas emissions that are applied in respect of individual animals are based on the level of output.  An animal with a higher output would, therefore, produce a higher level of emissions.  However, it is still a more efficient way of expending output than taking on additional animals.  It is also obviously more efficient from the point of view of labour, economics and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Deputy Ned O'Keeffe also referred to the dairy industry being too commodity-focused.  The major difficulty with regard to the dairy sector relates to seasonal supply.  We are extremely limited in terms of what we can produce because so much of our milk is supplied in the period March to June or July.  That is why the majority of production is focused on milk powders and butters.  We have, however, benefited from this type of product portfolio in recent years because most of the growth in demand from developing countries relates to products such as milk powders.  These are the products which have increased most in price in recent years.  I have covered most of the points that were raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">I will make a brief point and I accept that it is somewhat tangential in nature.  I refer to carbon leakage and the issues raised in Mr. Mark Gibson's article in <i>Today’s Farm</i>.  The question that arises for many people outside the committee is whether we should reduce the numbers in the national herd.  My view is that, particularly for economic reasons, we should not do so.  There is also a scientific opinion which indicates that, because of carbon leakage, we should not do so.  Will Dr. Hennessy provide a brief outline regarding how Teagasc defines carbon leakage?</p>

          <p eId="para_106">If one considers that the world has a demand for food at a certain level, countries in Europe can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%.  However, Brazil, Argentina and other non-European countries that are large exporters can take up that market, supply food and increase their greenhouse gas emissions, possibly by even more than we would have because their environmental practices are poorer.  That is what constitutes carbon leakage.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">It is important that an equivalence of standards should obtain in respect of all production.  A certain young person presented a calculation on total inputs which shows that Ireland, if not in the lead, is certainly among the top two countries in the world in terms of efficiency with regard to the production of a litre of milk.  Carbon leakage means that it goes somewhere else but it also means that more carbon is used to produce a litre of milk in other countries.  That is a good point to stress in defence of our system.  As stated earlier, it would be good if the calculation to which I refer could be built in to the system.  Ireland produces milk as efficiently as any other country and we should not apologise for that or for increasing production, as envisaged in Food Harvest 2020.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">Would it be possible to double the number of bovines if we were not completely dependent on grass and if we moved to feeding animals on concentrate feed?  In such circumstances, a cow which currently produces 1,200 gallons of milk would produce perhaps 1,600 gallons or more.  The animal would be more productive but the same level of cost would apply.  A Dutch farmer who visited my farm recently informed me that in his country they are cutting back on grass consumption and focusing more on concentrates.  Since his visit, the price of concentrates has almost doubled.  So an issue arises in that regard.  I understand the price is currently rocketing towards €400 per tonne.  Would it be possible to have 5 million cows if we moved toward increasing the consumption of concentrates and moving away from grass?</p>

          <from>Dr. Thia Hennessy</from>
          <p eId="para_112">Compared to other countries Ireland has a very low use of concentrate feed for the amount of milk produced per cow.  This is because cows graze for a much longer part of the year and consume more grass than would be the case in mainland Europe, where they may be in a feed lot or where there may be greater reliance on concentrate feed.  The coefficients that are applied in respect of the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by a cow depend on the amount of milk the animal produces.  On average, cows in this country produce approximately 5,000 litres of milk.  Increasing the yield to 8,000 or 9,000 litres would present a number of difficulties in itself but if it was possible, the greenhouse gas emission coefficient that would apply would be higher.  It would still be more efficient than having two cows produce 4,000 litres each but it would increase the output of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_115">We have already appeared before that committee.  I wish to make one point about a matter which is often forgotten.  The calculations relating to so-called carbon footprinting are extremely complicated.  It is our view that a whole-system assessment must be carried out.  If one considers a system that would be intensive in the use of grain, one must examine the carbon footprint involved in the production of that grain in the context of milling, transport, and so on.  This is often not taken into account.  When a full system analysis is carried out, there is no doubt that per litre of milk produced, the grass system is much less intensive with regard to the production of carbon.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">I agree with the Deputy in one respect and there is no point in trying to deny it.  We will continue to make efficiency gains and there will also be gains in respect of carbon.  That is a very important consideration.  Every unit gain in terms of efficiency represents a corresponding gain in carbon reduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Obviously, the volume of animals will increase and one would need massive gains in efficiency to offset it.  At present, the carbon target is an aggregate total target and is not calculated per unit of production.  Consequently, one almost is talking about apples and oranges.  The current model is an aggregate target and realistically, something like a significant reduction in the beef herd, for example, would be required.  Although our presentation contains a modest proposal regarding an increase in the value of beef output, a reduction in the beef herd to offset the dairy herd increase would be a way of compensating on carbon.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">It is important that I refer to GM technology, as the issue has been raised.  Obviously, public policy is clear in this regard at two levels.  First, the policy is completely opposed to the production of grains or other crops using GM in Ireland.  Second, particularly arising from the Pathways for Growth and Food Harvest 2020 proposals, a clear view is emerging that from the perspective of marketing our food produce, there is benefit to being able to retain a green image and so forth, which is associated with having a GM-free technology.  This is the policy and the only point I would make from a scientific perspective is that as a scientific organisation, Teagasc believes it is very important that science continues to be conducted within Ireland in respect of these matters.  For example, it is regrettable that Teagasc is unable to conduct land trials using GM technologies because that is quite separate from the commercial use of such technology.  However, it is very important in terms of advancing our scientific understanding, not least in respect of the impact that GM technologies might have on humans or on livestock in the case of the production of feed.</p>

The Deputy raised the question of the potential conflict between land for food versus land for energy and forestry.  My only observation is that in a free market, people are free to decide on the manner in which they wish to use their own resources.  Economics ultimately will determine that, unless policy wishes to intervene.  For example, I recently visited Finland and have noticed that its Government tries to override private decision-making by determining that in certain areas, only certain types of activity can be conducted for environmental and other reasons.  Ultimately the market will drive how resources are allocated and clearly, if this is to be interfered with, it is a matter for the political system to decide whether there are conflicts that must be addressed.</p>

It is important to understand what drives added value.  While seasonality is a constraint, it fundamentally is driven by innovation.  One cannot have value added products unless one invests significantly in innovation.  That is the big difference with commodity products.  Competitiveness in respect of commodity products is driven by the cost of producing the raw material.  We are very good at that and will continue to have profitable businesses and employment.  However, if one wishes to drive added value seriously, especially given our seasonality, I strongly make the point that one requires significant investment in innovation.  Members could look to other countries and consider companies such as Valio in Finland, for example, and its phenomenal but costly commitment to innovation.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">Absolutely.  The issues pertaining to Food Harvest 2020 and the challenges posed to Teagasc by the moratorium probably were worthy of a meeting on their own.  The artisan food sector has a role.  It is a niche sector and relates to the point about added value made a few minutes ago by Deputy Edward O'Keeffe.  There is a role for a co-operative structure in respect of artisan products and added value in which local growers and producer groups could get involved and select markets.  Artisan products do not tend to be export-driven in the same way that value-added conventional food production is.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">With regard to poultry, out of all of the factors of production mentioned, that industry is probably the most challenged by imports.  It is also subject to feed price volatility in the same way as pigs.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland and EU regulations on gas flushed fillet imports state that the slaughter and package date does not have to be indicated; rather, it can be one or the other, which distorts the true sell by date of the product.  It is undermining Irish industry with the result is that we have lost probably two thirds of the poultry processing sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I am not sure we need to discuss the role of Teagasc.  It is more of a monitoring role and it would be interesting if we did a strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis, on a few other sectors.  It is a very useful exercise.  We could examine the beef and sheep sectors, in particular, where a 10% growth in value has been identified in 2020.  On the comments on land use, it needs to be in the value-added area.  I am veering from the point a little, but there are 2,000 hectares of grass in the country, one quarter of which is in dairy production and three quarters of which is in dry stock production.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">We will have to change the dynamic.  There will be consolidation and we will have to get younger people involved in it, but a SWOT analysis of the beef and dry stock sector will have to have that as a backdrop.  Having less land producing dry stock will not necessarily be at the cost of the value of those sectors.  Having examined the figures on poultry, meat and eggs, I conclude it is a useful model to use across other production systems.</p>

          <from>Deputy Edward O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_177">It is a very comprehensive briefing and I would like a meeting at which we could examine it in detail.  Great work is being done.  The biggest problem facing the artisan food and other industries is the strength of the multiples.  Many artisan producers operate small businesses.  There is centralised distribution where people take a product to Dublin or Santry from Cork.  Small producers are not able to handle that process and it kills off the small artisan food cottage industry.  They have some wonderful products but do not have outlets for them.  The number of small shops is decreasing.  It is a major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">In terms of the poultry industry, three quarters of the products on the shelves of the multiples are imported.  The biggest challenge is identification.  Most consumers are very conscious of Irish products from the North or South but they cannot see the labels.  Until we have a system of identification of the country of origin we will never have a proper Irish food industry.  Poultry has been the first area to be affected and we will probably see slippage in the pig industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">While Teagasc is doing wonderful work, which I appreciate and praise it for, if the multiples do not run with us we will not go anywhere.  I am aware of several small food producers who could not get their products on shelves because they were unable to travel to central distribution centres as they were too far away and it was not economically viable.  The products would not be collected locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">All of these issues need to be addressed.  It is not Teagasc's problem; it is doing well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_100">
          <from>Professor Gerry Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_181">There are opportunities in the artisan food sector.  I spoke recently at a conference at which Ballyhoura celebrated 21 years of being involved in community development and the theme came across strongly.  We have tried to support the sector through technical advice in the preparation of food and developing products and so forth.  If any of the members are interested, it is organised in our Ashtown site in Castleknock.  We have an SME technology support service.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Another aspect to artisan foods which is quite interesting and very encouraging is that producers have come together in some areas, assisted by Teagasc advisers and others, to pool their resources and brand their products.  There are a number of fabulous examples.  For example, Kerry lamb is now well established and there is a similar group in Mayo.  It is a very interesting development because it shows the two things which are required to develop the sector.  One is the fact that producers need logistical support.  This type of enterprise does not happen by accident.  Some local individual whom the advisers can help is needed to drive it.  The second element which is needed is branding support.  Products can be produced very well.  It is interesting to consider other countries, such as Scotland.  We have closed down a lot of small local abattoirs which is something which needs to be examined because it is a large obstacle to encouraging returns in the sector.  Scotland is a good example because producers on a fairly significant scale are able to make a very decent living because they have access to more local abattoirs.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Deputy O'Keeffe is correct in regard to the role of multiples.  I may be naive but because artisan producers are not trying to compete on price and are selling a differentiated product which is highly specialised and local, it is not such a major issue.  Some producers become bigger and face the same issues as large companies.  Our farmers ultimately suffer in not being able to get a reasonable share of the value.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">For the reasons outlined by Deputy O'Keeffe, poultry has become a highly concentrated industry.  We have very little resources devoted to it and there is a substantial level of vertical integration.  That is the way the industry has gone.  I regret to say that we just about keep our hand in some aspects of the programme.  I hope the pig sector does not go that way because it is much more important, as the Deputy knows.  It is heading in the same direction.  There are issues which need to be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">One of the issues which arises time and again involving poultry and pigs is how one handles the animal manures.  They are not waste; they are clearly valuable.  There is a real challenge for the future viability of both sectors.</p>
