#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.The procedures my predecessor outlined to the House on use of the ministerial air transport service, MATS, most recently on 22 April 2008, have not changed.The position is that my approval is required prior to the service being used.  Procedurally, requests for use of the service are made by Ministers' private secretaries to my office and are dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office.Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need for and purpose of travel, the destination and other logistical details.  Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at that point.  All screened requests are then submitted to me for my consideration and approval, if deemed appropriate.  Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the office of the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or Air Corps.No changes are proposed in the procedures for the use of the ministerial air transport service.  All applications for use of MATS are considered in the context of its efficiencies.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, speaking for the Government when he says that members of the Government could make substantial savings by travelling on commercial flights?  Does the Taoiseach have any figures on the use of commercial flights by Ministers?Is the Gulfstream jet back in operation?  I understand it costs €7,100 an hour.  It was out of commission for several months in 2008 and, after a major overhaul costing almost €2 million, something went in it three weeks later and it was stranded for a while.  What is the situation?  I know it is an aging aircraft, but if these machines are well serviced, they have a very long lifespan.  Is the Minister, Deputy Gormley, speaking for the Government when he says there will now be a big shift onto commercial air flights?  What is the status of the Gulfstream?  Is it operational and fully ready to fly?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Where appropriate, scheduled flights are used by Ministers.  In addition, use is made of the ministerial air transport service when it is the only way for a Minister to travel to meetings and carry out his or her ministerial functions.  It offers the type of flexibility that scheduled flights cannot provide.  It is not tied to set routes or timetables.  The jet can also use military as well as civil airports and it can lead to significant savings in travel time.When considering applications for the use of Government jets, regard is had to the availability of scheduled flights as well the differences in financial costs and levels of emissions.  A balance has to be struck.  Even though sometimes there may be significant cost differentials, other factors such as the level of flexibility available, the purpose of the travel, destination, route, timings and passenger details warrant use of a Government jet as opposed to alternative scheduled flights.  They are used, as the Deputy knows, interchangeably.Regarding the Gulfstream, as the Deputy knows, it has been in service for 17 or 18 years and has an annual overhaul as required by the service guidelines applying to it.  It is operational and is kept in proper repair by the Air Corps.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I recognise the value of having a jet for the prime minister of a country and the busier Departments.  We had this argument before.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has been very upfront about carbon footprints.  There is no extra carbon footprint when one takes a commercial flight because it is going anyway.  I do not believe Prime Minister Blair ever had the use of a government jet.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	8	He used the RAF, but that is a different carbon footprint, as the Ministers know.Does the Taoiseach have a figure for the carbon footprint per kilometre of the Gulfstream and the Lear jets?  I am not sure how that is calculated, but if it can be calculated for cars, it can be done for jets.  Given that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is very agitated about this matter, I note that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, went on a failed mission to Austin, Texas, to talk to Mr. Michael Dell prior to the Dell announcement, which, we are told, cost €164,000.  I just checked before coming to the Chamber and an economy American Airlines flight leaving Dublin tomorrow and returning in two days would cost €1,000 for the two Ministers.  However, since they are Ministers, it would cost €9,000 if they travelled business class to Dallas.  An internal flight to Austin would be very reasonable.When the request was made for both Ministers to fly to Texas, the Taoiseach's Department vetted it.  Would it not have been considered that substantial savings could be made if both Ministers flew comfortably in business class to Texas?  Has the Taoiseach since issued reminders that, where possible and within reason, people should fly commercially when such flights are available?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On the specific issue, there was a requirement to meet with the managing director of Dell very quickly in regard to impending decisions and it was the right thing to do in the circumstances.I am informed by the Department of Defence that, in keeping with normal practice in the aviation business, it is not possible to assign an exact cost to any particular mission.  However, on the basis of an approximation to actual costs, the average direct cost of €4,000 per hour would be a more reasonable measure.  These are costs which arise while the aircraft is being flown and include maintenance, fuel and support services.  One is at times required to meet a number of people from one stage to another and the jet is used for that purpose.  Scheduled flights could not be used in situations where, for example, one is going to Luxembourg and Berlin before continuing on to London.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I recall the former Taoiseach, Mr. Reynolds, stopping off at various locations.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The idea in these modern times that Government business can be conducted without requiring the use of these facilities is not correct.  In the interest of getting work done and then returning, it is important they are used.  It is also important, where it is appropriate and in line with timings, etc., to use scheduled flights.  I have done so myself.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	13	In regard to carbon footprints, how are these calculated for a jet such as that used by the Government?

He stated that we could get rid of the Government jet in the morning and it would not cause us any problem whatsoever.  Does the Taoiseach agree with that statement?  Would he agree, for example, that since the first purchase of a Government jet in 1980, there has been a huge increase in the availability of commercial flights and access from this country to various parts of Europe and elsewhere and that perhaps the Minister is correct that getting rid of the Government jet would not cause any problems?What is the status of the Minister's statement?  The notion of what is termed "collective cabinet responsibility" used to exist.  I would like to know if the Minister's opinion is in fact the Government's opinion and how the Taoiseach might feel if the House put the statement to the test.  What is the Taoiseach's view of the Minister's statement?Arising from the Taoiseach's earlier reply to Deputy Kenny on the procedure whereby Ministers apply to his Department for the use of the Government jet and are either approved or refused, how many applications were received by the Department in the past year for the use of the jet and how many of these were refused?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I do not have that information to hand and will have to get it for the Deputy.  The Department of Defence has information on the detailed arrangements regarding the numbers of flights, who goes where and whatever else.In regard to the first matter, a Government jet is necessary to conduct our business.  It is not required in all cases or at all times by all Ministers and it is not used in all cases or at all times by all Ministers.  In the context of doing business, it is necessary to make these facilities available.  In the course of one's work, occasions arise when one moves from one capital to another.  It would not be possible to do that through scheduled flights alone but it is not something that is sought to be used inappropriately.  The Government jet is used in the conduct of Government business and so that one can get back the same day rather than wait overnight for flights, thereby ensuring one is available the following morning or day to do one's job here at home.  It is part of the conduct of business of Government and it is the practice of all Governments of which I am aware, in particular those in the European Union.

For example, is it used in connection with business in Brussels and, if so, how many times has it been used given the reasonably regular scheduled service to that city?The Taoiseach referred to the Government jet.  There are three such aircraft or two and a half at least.  The Beechcraft was acquired in 1980 and Gulfstream IV was acquired in 1991.  Are there any plans to replace those aircraft?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Gulfstream IV has been in service for almost 17 years and is at this point the longest serving aircraft of its type in the world.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The Learjet which was purchased some time ago caters for shorter flights to Europe and so on.  The Beechcraft is used by the Air Corps for aircraft training purposes.  It is not used often, if at all, for travel purposes given, as stated, it is 29 years old.  They are the aircraft available.On the Deputy's other question, the Government jet is used from time to time in connection with business in Brussels bearing in mind what time meetings are taking place and at what time people are required to be back home.  This type of service is not guaranteed on scheduled flights.  It is not possible to use scheduled services in all cases though they are used by personnel doing business in Brussels on a regular basis.

Would it not be better for the Government to dispose of it or to sign it over to the Air Corps?The Taoiseach shared with us statistics in regard to the use of Government jets by Ministers.  Can he provided us with the statistics in regard to the use of commercial airline services by Ministers as a first choice?  Does the Taoiseach have information in respect of foreign travel catered for by scheduled flights operated by commercial airlines and, if so, will he share that information with us?Last Saturday, we all raised a cheer in celebration of Ireland's win over France.  When listening earlier to questions from my colleagues, I was reminded of the Taoiseach's rugby interests and his attendance last year at the Heineken Cup final in Cardiff.  The Taoiseach may recall the heavy water which he and Ministers Cullen and Martin got into in respect of their exploration of Welsh-Irish relations during their attendance with Mr. Morgan at the cup final in Cardiff.  Did the Taoiseach, arising out of that early experience in his role as Taoiseach initiate any new regulations or standards which Members, Ministers or taoisigh should meet in respect of the use of the Government jet or jets?  Will the Taoiseach accept there was quite a brouhaha in that regard at the time?  It certainly raised some questions that merited address.Leaving aside inappropriate use of Government jets by Ministers and taoisigh, will the Taoiseach comment on inappropriate use of Government jets for the transport of unofficial representatives.  For example, for the visit last year by the Minister, Deputy Harney, to the United States in an effort to inform herself of further measures to privatise health services, I understand she was accompanied by her husband.Is it appropriate that those who are not Government Ministers, including family, acquaintances and so on — where does one draw the line? — have the opportunity to accompany Ministers on ostensibly official business representing the Government?  If this is the case, is it frequent or infrequent?  Is there any regulation in regard to offsetting the cost through a contribution?  Arising out of the exposure of that trip, did the Taoiseach take any steps or further actions following his Cardiff experience to set in train more appropriate guidelines for the use of Government jets into the future?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	26	As I said earlier, the same regulations apply now as applied in my predecessor's time;  there has been no change in the arrangements.With regard to the question of accompaniment, if people are on official visits, it is possible to be accompanied from time to time by one's spouse, although it does not often happen.With regard to the question of the use of scheduled flights, I speak for myself and if the Deputy wants more general information he would be best to put his questions to the Minister for Defence.  In regard to my own situation, since I became Taoiseach I have travelled to the United States and Japan on official visits by scheduled flights.  I have travelled by way of Government jet to Brussels for Council meetings and I have travelled to a number of capitals during the course of preparing for European Council meetings by Government jet.  It would not have been possible to conduct those meetings in the time available where it not for the Government jet.

However, given the Taoiseach has indicated that, as Taoiseach, he has employed the use of commercial airline scheduled flights, does he agree that the information in regard to the ratio of use between commercial airline scheduled flights and the use of the Government jet, across not only his own Department but all Departments, would be a useful aid to having a better picture and understanding of the balance, if such exists, and if it applies as a balance across the board?Finally, from the experiences I have instanced that attracted a degree of public attention and some critical voices, has the Taoiseach in the course of his tenure introduced any new rulings or indications of what he expects from Ministers?  Has he communicated to his colleagues across the Cabinet the standards he would like to see applied in the use of this facility?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I do not have to apply my standards to anyone else.  The standards are simply applied as appropriate in line with the regulations.  I have always used these facilities on the basis of official visits or official work.  As I said, the workload for officeholders both at home and abroad is such that on many occasions obtaining a scheduled flight place is not an option, particularly due to the times involved, with many meetings held in the evening and so on.  Other work is ongoing during the course of the day, including coming to and being answerable to this House.  When one leaves for a meeting abroad, there may be criticism as to why one is not still at home, answering questions, having probably done so for an hour or two that morning.One cannot win.  The bottom line is that one has to do the job that has been assigned to one to the best of one's ability, using the facilities as appropriate, and obviously being mindful of the cost effectiveness of these issues where long flights and other flights can be accommodated by scheduled arrangements with normal aircraft, which are often used, as I have indicated.

I have no difficulty with the Government using a jet, because the job of the Government is to govern and there is a need for one.  Has the Minister, Deputy Gormley, raised the matter of getting rid of the Government jet directly with the Taoiseach?  Will the Taoiseach confirm, if he has the details before him, how many times the two Green Party Ministers and the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Trevor Sargent, have used the Government jet since taking office?  This is typical of the Green Party, speaking out of both sides of the mouth.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I do not accept that.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, was answering a question in respect of a wide-ranging interview on the radio.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I am about to answer the question.  The fact that the Minister was responding to a wide-ranging interview and gave his opinion on these matters is fine.  These matters are not raised directly with me.  However, the question of offsetting the carbon footprint from the use of air travel by Ministers is an arrangement which the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has brought into place.  Indeed, he has backdated the arrangement to the beginning of the Administration in 2007 following the general election.  Initiatives have been taken by the Minister concerned from a carbon emissions point of view.  This was a good initiative and one which heightens awareness of the issue and ensures there is an offset in respect of any carbon emissions arising as a result of the use of these aircraft for Government purposes.  It is a good initiative.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 17, inclusive, together.Agreement was reached on the review and transitional agreement 2008-09 on 17 September 2008.  The transitional agreement sought to provide certainty and stability during a period of great change and difficulty facing the economy while maintaining the orderly conduct of industrial relations.The transitional agreement was subsequently ratified by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the main employers' body, IBEC, on 17 November.I have noted the recent letter from IBEC to ICTU on the application of the pay terms of the agreement in the private sector.  I understand that representatives of ICTU and IBEC have had direct discussions on this and other issues related to the implementation of the agreement.  In this regard, I believe it is important to note that the transitional agreement contains robust "inability to pay" provisions specifically designed to take account of current economic realities.  I was disappointed that the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, did not consider it possible to ratify the agreement last November.  While recognising the very real difficulties experienced by CIF member companies, I am of the view that these difficulties could be addressed successfully within the social partnership agreement, provided all parties approached the issues in a constructive way.In the period subsequent to the conclusion of the transitional agreement in September, there has been a serious deterioration in the global economy, greatly exacerbating domestic economic and fiscal pressures.  The Government responded by bringing forward the date of the 2009 budget and subsequently published a framework for sustainable economic renewal in December, which outlines a set of measures to support a return to sustainable growth and jobs in the medium term, while also identifying the need for short-term measures to stabilise the economy and public finances.The Government invited the views of the social partners on implementation of the framework for sustainable economic renewal and on the immediate fiscal adjustment required in 2009.  The social partners engaged in extensive and meaningful discussions on these issues over recent weeks.On Wednesday, 28 January the Government and social partners agreed on a framework for a pact for stabilisation, social solidarity and economic renewal.  That framework acknowledged that urgent and radical action was required to restore stability to the public finances, to maximise short-term economic activity and employment and to improve competitiveness.Last week there were intensive discussions between the Government and social partners to attempt to agree within that framework on the key elements of the fiscal adjustment required.In the context of the discussions, the Government tabled proposals to achieve a full-year saving of €1.4 billion through the introduction of a pension levy in the public service.  The unions decided that they were not in a position to agree to that proposal.  While this is regrettable, it does not mean that the engagement was a failure.  The overall framework for eliminating the current budget deficit by 2013 was agreed and the need for a €2 billion adjustment this year on a credible basis was also agreed.  The need for a significant contribution to be made by the public service pay bill in achieving that adjustment was also agreed, as were the links to the economic renewal strategy published in December.The Government's decisions last week on achieving the €2 billion adjustment were taken within these parameters and in accordance with principles agreed with the social partners.  In respect of the public service, implementation will be discussed in the normal way with the public service committee of ICTU.The social partnership process focuses on engagement and the sharing of analysis, as well as the forging of specific agreements.  The discussions over the past few weeks have deepened the shared understanding of the challenges facing the economy.  The inability of ICTU to agree to the Government's proposals does not mean that the partnership process has failed.  The overall framework agreed with the social partners remains in place and the Government, for its part is committed to its implementation.  We are available to continue discussions on the implementation of the overall framework.I am chairing a Cabinet committee which will implement the Government strategy for economic renewal.  A senior officials group chaired by my Department supports the work of this Cabinet committee.  Relevant Ministers will report regularly on progress in the key action areas, as well as bringing forward new proposals consistent with the strategic direction of the framework in their respective areas of responsibility.Given the importance of focusing on the agenda for economic renewal, and the role of investment in infrastructure in that regard, the work of the Cabinet committee on housing, infrastructure and PPPs, and its supporting cross-departmental team is subsumed by these new arrangements.Apart from the pay provisions, the transitional agreement contains a comprehensive set of commitments dealing with such issues as employment rights and compliance; workplace learning and upskilling; employee representation; the regulation of employment agencies and temporary agency workers; and pensions and public procurement.Following ratification of the agreement, work has commenced on the implementation of these commitments which, in the employment law area in particular, will involve several significant new Bills.  In addition, a monitoring and review process with representatives from IBEC, ICTU and all relevant Departments has been established to oversee progress on all of these issues.The agreement also sets out an agenda for public service modernisation which builds on the extensive commitments contained in Towards 2016.  There is an ambitious programme of work getting under way in this area on foot of the publication last November of the report of the taskforce on the public service and the Government statement on transforming public services.  The Cabinet committee on transforming public services will oversee this transformation programme.The national implementation body, NIB, which comprises representatives of Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and IBEC, and is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, continues to meet as necessary to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions of the Towards 2016 transitional agreement.The NIB has dealt with several important disputes in recent months, including the issue of restructuring Aer Lingus, and is overseeing a process undertaken by the Labour Relations Commission which is aimed at supporting the implementation of a 37.5 hour working week for nurses.  Meetings of the body also provide opportunities for informal discussions on some broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally.  These discussions are held regularly.The National Economic and Social Council's last few meetings discussed Ireland's current economic crisis and will continue to contribute to the evolution of thinking in this regard.  Its work programme for 2009 also includes the following studies — the role of the European Union in Ireland's economic and social development; preparation of Ireland's first social report; climate change and sustainable energy; standards and accountability in human services in Ireland; and innovation — widening and deepening Ireland's innovation policies in the context of globalisation.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Taoiseach referred to the transitional agreement which the social partners negotiated last September.  Is that agreement not now in tatters?  The Construction Industry Federation said that it would not partake in it.  IBEC, which ratified it, announced recently that it will not honour its pay terms.  Last week in the House the Taoiseach effectively said the same, that in respect of employees in the public service the pay terms of that agreement cannot be honoured.  A string of industry representative bodies covered by the joint labour committees have indicated they are having difficulty paying the terms of the legally enforceable employment regulation orders in their industries.  Since the agreement was negotiated the Taoiseach announced a budget which imposed an income levy, or tax on incomes, a reduction in a variety of tax reliefs applying to pay as you earn, PAYE, workers and the introduction of, or increase in, several levies and charges.  In addition, he announced last week a 7.5% average so-called pension levy on public service employees which is in effect a pay cut for those employees.While there is much lip service being paid to the concept, principle and desirability of social partnership, the reality is that the agreement at the heart of the social partnership process is now in tatters.  There is little or no prospect of the pay elements of that agreement ever being implemented.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	37	We have social partnership structures and processes in place.  It is true that we have a pay freeze in the public sector until October.  We indicated that we would not be able to pay the instalments due in October 2009 and June 2010, due to current financial arrangements.  Representatives of ICTU and IBEC have had discussions on the private sector pay agreement and others issues related to the implementation of the agreement.  There are difficulties, strains and problems, as a result of the deterioration of the economy since the agreement was made in September.  Assumptions have since considerably changed on things like inflation trends, which would have informed the basis of the agreement in September.We have a voluntary system of industrial relations in this country.  We have had centralised agreements in the past, and they have brought benefits.  It is true that there are strains and difficulties, but it is only through continuing dialogue that these issues can be resolved.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	38	There was a report in the newspapers today that ESB workers will take a two year pay freeze, and will not receive the 2.5% pay instalment due in June.  What is the Taoiseach's view of corporate governance in the ESB, when the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources only heard of the acceptance of the 3.5% increase from the media?  Does the Taoiseach regret that the pay increases were awarded in September, in view of the fact that the financial crisis has worsened considerably since then?The Taoiseach commented last week that he would listen attentively if there was a tweaking of the pension levy proposals that might bring the unions back onside.  A number of those union personnel were quite upset at being put in the position of being decision makers, when they were not elected so to be, even though their contribution has been important.Has the Taoiseach made contact with the unions in respect of any tweaking on the pension levy proposal?  If he has made such contact, has there been any response?  Is he considering the idea of looking at the lower paid members of the public sector when evaluating the pension levy?  Many of those members will be required to pay a pension levy for a pension that they will effectively never receive, as they will be entitled to the State contributory pension in any event.  This is causing a great deal of anger and pressure on the families of thousands of those workers.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	39	As I said, we have a voluntary system of industrial relations in this country, and employers and unions agreed a pay deal last September.  There is flexibility within that pay deal for those companies that wish to claim inability to pay.  If companies that have profits and are in a position to pay decide to proceed with payment, they will be in compliance with the pay deal that was agreed between the employers and the unions and ratified by the employers' body and the union members on 17 November last.  That is the position on the first point.The second point obviously relates to developments since then.  That particular company's approach is an indication of the sensitivity it wishes to show to other workers who are in a far more difficult situation.  It has stated its intentions, at this stage, regarding any further amounts that are due under the deal.  I hope that will confirm that the company is trying to add to public confidence.  There is a requirement to show restraint, even in those companies that have an ability to pay the first instalment of the deal.  Agreement was reached between management and unions, in line with the voluntary nature of this country's industrial relations system.I would like to make the point that at the time, Fine Gael's spokesman on finance issued a statement to the effect that he welcomed the deal.  I presume the representatives of unions and workers in firms that are in a position to pay, or have the ability to pay, will be knocking on doors to inquire whether the deal that has been struck will be honoured.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	43	At last Tuesday's press conference, I was asked what attitude I would take in respect of proposals that might be made in respect of the levy.  I indicated that if the scheme had the effect that was being suggested in some quarters, we would examine it.  I did not say we would not look at it.  Obviously, the substance of any proposal would have to be considered.  I made it clear that its content would have to enable one to raise the €1.4 billion the scheme is designed to raise.  As Deputy Kenny knows, it applies to all workers in all sectors of the public service, including civil servants, health care workers, members of the Defence Forces and teachers.  I take the point that any levy, by its nature, is an imposition.  We have had to consider this issue in the context of the need for a wider economic response to the budgetary situation in the public finances and to aspects of the wider economy such as competitiveness.  We made it clear in our discussions that the bulk of the savings would have to come in this area.  If we did not do so, we would have had to consider making savings in the social welfare system or through the dislocation of services in non-pay areas.  That was the decision the Government took.  It motivated the decision that was announced last week.  As Deputy Kenny said, some people at the lower end of the scale have been taken out of the tax net altogether as a result of the introduction in recent years of a more progressive income tax system.  Questions such as future pension entitlements, and the security of tenure one enjoys in the meantime, also arise.  These are all considerations.  Some people will have a difficulty with it in any event, regardless of the line of argument that is taken.  Decisions were taken on the basis of the situation the Government had to confront.

Surely the Taoiseach realised the unions could not have run with such a proposition.  How does he respond to the view, which I have heard expressed by many people, that the Government made a conscious decision not to be serious about trying to reach agreement with the trade unions during the talks?  How does he respond to the view, which has considerable support, that the Government had taken comfort from an already indicated IBEC agreement on the measures involved and decided, with the support of many in the media — not least the Independent Group which was in a full flow tirade of abuse directed at the public service and the trade unions — to hell with it, it would run with it, go for broke and let the negotiations collapse?  Will the Taoiseach give us his view on these charges?  Will he confirm that the social partnership process has been seriously damaged as a result of the collapse of the negotiations and that if it is to be rebuilt — this is an important point — the public service pension levy will have to be revisited?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	46	We have had situations in the past where we have had no national agreement and others where we have had national agreements where occasionally employers pleaded inability to pay.  We have never had a situation where we have had a national pay agreement which virtually nobody will pay.  The Government will not pay it and IBEC says it will not pay it.  It is a pay agreement which is now a fiction.Does the Taoiseach have any plans to reconvene a meeting of the social partners to arrive at a real understanding or agreement on matters relating to pay, taxes, levies and all that goes with it?  The average family does not know where they stand.  The prospect of a pay increase is off the table.  In many cases, jobs are at risk.  The question of pay cuts is on the table in many areas, including, effectively, in the public service.  Now the Taoiseach and all his Ministers are talking about the prospect of tax increases sometime later in the year.  The average family has no idea what their personal and family budgets are for the year.  It would be a good idea if the Taoiseach reconvened a meeting of the social partners to get some real understanding as to the situation on pay, given that what we have currently is a fiction.  The Government has an agreement on paper, which, as everybody knows, will not be implemented.  It will only succeed, ultimately, in bringing the whole theory of social partnership into disrepute.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I do not agree with the contentions of either Deputy Ó Caoláin or Deputy Gilmore in terms of what they had to say.  Deputy Ó Caoláin is the first, I understand, to question the good faith of the partners, including the Government, on the detailed and long negotiations that took place.  No one who came out of those talks — people with whom we have been dealing on an ongoing basis — made the assertions he has just made.  That indicates not only the inaccuracy of those assertions, but the fact that they have no foundation in fact.Everyone strove to see if an agreement was possible.  The engagement was sincere and real efforts were made.  Unfortunately, at the end of the day, it was not possible to find agreement on those aspects that were required in terms of the savings, but there was agreement that those sorts of savings were required, that public service pay, remuneration and pension would form an important part of the identification of those savings.

That was not the situation.  We tried over a period of weeks, as I said we would, to see if it was possible to obtain consensus on the matter.  It was not possible, unfortunately, but the Deputy does not have to question the bona fides of everyone who was in there.  That is the easy thing to do when one is outside the door, playing the hurler on the ditch game.  People were in there making a sincere effort, on behalf of their country, their constituencies and those whom they represent — they have different interests which are equally legitimate — to try to find a way forward in what is a very difficult situation for everybody.  I refute and reject the picture painted by the Deputy regarding everyone's intentions and efforts.The second point I would make in regard to——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I have listened to those who represent other interests at those talks, but the assertions the Deputy made were not made by anybody else. Deputies will be aware also that the talks covered a long agenda linked to the headline issues under the framework agreed some days before.  Each issue required lengthy and detailed consideration in turn and, in accordance with normal practice in these types of negotiations, there were very experienced and skilled negotiators on all sides.  Issues in respect of pay were discussed after all the other issues were dealt with.That said, social partners were aware from an early stage that the majority of the €2 billion savings was required to be found from the public service pay bill, and that a pensions levy was the most likely vehicle for securing these savings.  In the immediate aftermath of the breakdown of the talks, the contention was made that it was a surprise that this issue arose and the stage at which it arose.  Anybody who knows anything about the dynamics of negotiations knows that such was not the case.  Obviously, an orientation in the discussion took place over the weekend.  One waits to see the way ahead.  It would have been a requirement of some of the negotiators to know where the Government was going on some issues in order that they could look at the issue they had in hand.  To suggest, simplistically, that there were many inexperienced people who did not know what they were doing is an injustice to the negotiating skills and track record of all those people.

That was the picture that was painted.  What was first broadcast on radio, namely, the first couple of inserts on "Morning Ireland", became the picture.  That is incorrect.With regard to the points made by Deputy Gilmore, there are instances where the pay agreement is being honoured, or has been paid.  As Deputies know, there are inability-to-pay clauses and there has been a serious deterioration since those negotiations were completed.  The assumptions upon which they were made have changed.  All that has happened because of the unprecedented situation which this and every other country faces.  The context is the deepening economic recession which is enveloping, not only the advanced economies of the world, but all parts.  The question of reconvening talks is a matter, therefore, that would require the agreement of all sides.  The current position of the trade union movement is that it has an agreement and that those who are in a position to pay should pay and those who have a problem should proceed, in the normal way, to use the terms of the agreement to address issues and to try to deal with these matters at enterprise levels.  That is the position.  It is not a question of the agreement being disregarded in that respect.  Obviously, there are difficulties, stresses and strains that are reflected in the new economic reality with which we contend.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.Encouraging a competitive energy supply is a key policy objective for the Government.  Rising energy costs are a major concern for all sectors of the economy and for consumers.  The regulation of ESB customer supply electricity tariffs and BGE gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002.I welcome that the CER announced on 1 December 2008 there would be no further increase in the price of gas from January 2009 and that there would be a small average decrease from that month of just less than 1% in the price of electricity supplied by ESB Customer Supply.  This decision is reflective of recent easing in international fossil fuel prices.  I also welcome the substantial rebate of about €400 million being provided by ESB to all electricity customers, irrespective of their supplier, which has helped to stabilise electricity prices for 2009.The two-phase approach to tariff regulation adopted by the CER last year resulted in price increases in the Irish market which were lower than those in some of our neighbouring markets.  In Great Britain, for example, independent suppliers increased electricity tariffs by more than 26% on average, and gas tariffs by more than 40% on average in 2008, in response to increasing fossil fuel prices.  By contrast, regulated tariffs in Ireland increased by an average of 17.5% in the case of electricity and 20% in the case of gas.  In taking this phased approach, the CER took account of the difficult economic situation and the impact of price increases on business and consumers, including vulnerable customers.The CER has previously demonstrated an ability to adapt its tariff regulation process in line with evolving market conditions.  I note, for example, the CER decision to end tariff regulation for large electricity users in 2006, based on its conclusion that there is a sufficient level of competition in this market.  The majority of large industrial and commercial electricity customers are currently supplied by independent suppliers.  Many of these large industrial consumers are on fuel variation tariffs and have already experienced the benefits of falling gas prices.The CER is required to ensure that regulated tariffs are cost reflective.  However, I believe it may be possible to lower energy costs to consumers in a non-distortionary fashion, through an expedited review of tariffs.  To achieve this, I have asked the energy regulator to undertake an immediate review of options to bring forward a reduction in electricity prices.  As I stated in this House last week, if current trends in energy prices, particularly gas, continue, I would expect a double-digit cut in electricity and gas prices to become a reality later this year.I also expect that, in the context of this review, the CER will advise on additional non-discriminatory and pro-competition measures that may be taken to bring about reductions in energy prices in the short-term.  The ESB rebate, which I mentioned earlier, demonstrates the type of imaginative solutions that can be developed when all parties work together to ensure the best outcome for energy consumers in Ireland.  I expect the timeframe for implementation of any reductions to become clearer in the coming weeks as we develop a better understanding of these potential measures.  The priority for the Government is to ensure that we act swiftly in the interests of energy consumers.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I agree with the Minister that it is important the Government acts swiftly in respect of these matters.  The Minister was instructed by the Taoiseach to undertake an energy price review and he is acting on that.  He has raised the bar somewhat by saying he expects a double-digit energy price reduction this year.  Presumably, he is talking about households.  What I and others wish to hear from him today is when we will see the short-term price review he spoke of today.  How long must we wait for that?Bord Gáis will launch a new product next week, supplying electricity to homes for prices that are 10% to 14% cheaper than those the ESB currently charges.  How can that be?  If that is the case — it is — does the Minister agree the regulated price for households is too high?  Can we expect a double-digit reduction in the regulated price for households to feature in the short-term review he mentioned today?Concerning the broader review of energy price regulation, can we expect the double-digit reduction in energy prices for the commercial-industrial sector?  That sector is not subject to direct price regulation but is subject to the influence of regulation in terms of the regulated price set by the CER for both networks and supply.  Both are services supplied by the ESB.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I confirm that what we are talking about, primarily, is the household sector.  As I said earlier, unlike householders, since 2006 the large business consumers have operated in an unregulated market.  Because of the nature of the contracts they have, these sectors are already seeing a double-digit reduction in prices, arising in particular from lower international gas prices.  The immediate timeframe set out is for the regulator — who was asked to see whether that expected reduction can be brought forward — to come to Government within three or four weeks with a range of different options.I refer to the debate we had here last week during Private Members' time.  There are a number of options in this regard, each of which might have advantages and disadvantages.  In my contribution I set out the disadvantage of a unilateral reduction from the ESB because of the effect it would have on competition.  I also mentioned the disadvantage of repeating the generous act the ESB undertook last year in forgoing €300 million in its revenue stream and a further €100 million this year from the sale to Endesa.  To transfer that across the market is not a satisfactory outcome because it could endanger some of the investments we want the ESB to make.My preferred option, if it is possible in a non-distortionary manner that does not affect competition and investment plans, which is important, is to see whether the regulator can bring forward such reductions from the October date we expected.  I was looking at the gas prices again this morning.  If one looks forward for the next six months or year — and most of the contracts are done forward — the price of gas is sufficiently low for us to confidently expect a double digit price reduction.  The exact month in which it occurs must be advised by the regulator.  That is the timeframe within which we are working.Bord Gáis must announce its plans.  I will not pre-empt——

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	65	Does the Minister accept that his desultory approach to this is insufficient to the task?  People's incomes are plummeting and their utility bills are soaring.  I do not know how insulated the Minister is from the realities of life but I will give a couple of quick examples in case he is not aware.  Sheila's bill was €250, now it is €323.  Brendan runs a business.  In 2002 the bill was €800.  The equivalent bill now is over €3,000.  Seán's bill was between €600 and €800; he was away for Christmas, yet his latest bill was €1,250.  Eileen had no Christmas tree, yet her ESB bill went up by €25.  That is what people live with.  For the Minister to attend the House and refer to a range of options is an inadequate response to the daily experiences encountered by people.When can people expect the two-digit reduction the Minister has promised  Will he ensure there is a price ceiling rather than a fixed price to allow, at long last, for some good value for people who struggle with their bills?  For too long we have seen competitiveness sacrificed on the altar of competition.  Does the Minister recognise we have to open it up in a way that meets the needs of consumers?  What will the Minister do to assist businesses that cannot compete?We have one of the highest levels of energy bills in Europe and we are operating in an incredibly difficult economic climate.  Does this not require urgency on the Minister's part to deal with this issue once and for all?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	66	He is doing nothing about it.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	67	At the centre of our energy policy is the interest of Irish householders and businesses, to ensure we can give them a secure, competitive and clean electricity supply.  The policies we are following will do exactly that.  We are not following competitive policies for the sake of some ideological reason but from the clear understanding that the introduction, particularly in recent weeks, of very large international utilities into this market will be the most important factor in continually driving down prices for the Irish householder and business community over the next year, five years and ten years.  That will deliver them lower prices.This is a crucial investment and development we must support and see through.  We must not turn it upside-down by completely getting rid of a regulatory system that is in place and acts as a crucial piece of infrastructure in an electricity market.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Nobody is suggesting that.

The process of examining the options is the correct choice.  One should not rush into this like a headless chicken, slashing and demanding change.  One should work through how to proceed in a way which maintains the various objectives and brings down prices consistently.  A short-term decision could, in the long run, lead to higher electricity prices, which would be against the interests of Irish householders.  That is why one is better to let the regulator work with the various companies involved in the area to come back with options from which the Government can make the call.  That is our central policy objective and is the right approach in this area.  It will bring down electricity prices.  We know that is coming from the price of the raw materials.  A proper, regulated and competitive market is the best way to extract every last cent of price reduction we can from the sector rather than making an initial decision that misses that opportunity.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Today the Minister said he will try to do something for householders who have high electricity bills but will invite options in three or four weeks' time.  He is doing nothing for the businesses of the country which are overcharged for electricity.  As a result, Ireland is an uncompetitive destination in terms of energy cost competitiveness.  The Minister says he will continue as normal and we will stick with the energy regulation plan that has been there for the last ten years.  No electricity cost adjustments will be made in response to a recession or as part of an economic recovery plan.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	72	In these very bleak times the Taoiseach announced he would deal with energy prices and that the Minister would have an extraordinary review with the regulator.  That means the Minister must show results.  What he said today clearly indicates he is still stuck in a rut.  He has not altered his position in the face of the economic climate and the personal difficulties people have, which should give him the sense of urgency that is required.  When will people, at a time when they desperately need it, benefit from the two-digit price reduction the Minister and his Taoiseach have promised on behalf of the Government?

The consistent determination by my Department, the Government and I to switch away from that reliance will be the second best guarantee that prices will be reduced.  The crucial third part of energy policy that one sticks to and gets right is having a fair and competitive regulatory system that will deliver lower prices.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Approximately €1 million was spent on the ocean energy programme in 2008.  The grant aid programme for companies is one element of a wide-ranging suite of initiatives intended to accelerate and strengthen the development of ocean energy technologies in Ireland.  These are managed by the ocean energy development unit, which is located at Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI.The ocean energy grant aid programme for industry was launched publicly in August last.  Responses were processed during September and October and full applications were sought during November.  Agreement on funding levels in accordance with EU State aid rules is now being finalised and the first contracts will be issued in a matter of weeks.  I am advised that the pace of expenditure will accelerate, increasing to around €7 million in 2009.  This will contribute to the delivery of the Government's high priority goal of supporting the development of Ireland's ocean energy potential in a reasonable timeframe.The ocean energy development unit was established last year within SEI.  The unit manages the ocean energy strategy and administers the substantial funding provided for the benefit of researchers and project developers.  The unit commenced the grant aid programme in its first year.  It has also invested in the creation of a state-of-the-art national ocean energy facility at University College Cork, which work will continue into 2009.  It is also managing the development of a grid-connected wave energy test site off the west coast.  In addition, in the same period, the unit has established an advisory group comprising my Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the coastal zone management division, Enterprise Ireland, EirGrid, ESB Networks, IDA Ireland, the Marine Institute and Science Foundation Ireland to co-ordinate the activities of these agencies in developing and delivering an efficient roadmap for ocean energy.  The unit has also commenced work on the delivery of studies of common interest to the sector, including a study on the engineering and specialist support requirements for the sector to enhance Ireland's capability to maximise participation in the construction and operation of wave and tidal systems; a review of the planning regime for ocean energy development; a strategic environmental assessment for ocean energy in Irish waters; an investigation of partnership with industry for data gathering and processing; and a detailed review of the macro-economic benefits that ocean energy can deliver for Ireland.The delays in launching the grant aid programme have not diverted us from the ten-year development plan set out in our ocean energy strategy.  These technologies are very much at research and development phases, and devices are using different approaches to try to generate electricity from the ocean.  The ocean energy unit is working closely with developers to develop and finalise their project applications.  I am satisfied that all components of the ocean energy package are now under way and are being advanced at a pace consistent with the priority the Government attaches to this area.  I am confident this programme will greatly assist in realising Ireland's huge potential in this area and will allow us to meet the Government's target of generating 500 MW of ocean energy by 2020.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I thank the Minister for his reply.  It was on 15 January 2008 that the Minister announced this initiative.  He announced that €1 million would be spent on a world class, state-of-the-art national ocean energy facility at UCC in 2008, that €2 million would be spent in 2008 to support and develop a grid-connected wave energy site near Belmullet, and that €2 million in grant aid would be provided in 2008 under the ocean energy prototype fund for developers of this type of technology.  How much of that €5 million was actually spent last year?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	91	As already stated, approximately €1 million.  Everyone would like to see all the money being spent.  The primary reason it was not was the delay in setting up the ocean energy unit.  This is a ten-year timeframe that was set out about three years ago in our ocean energy strategy.  It was set out in four quarters, with the first quarter to be reviewed at the end of 2007.  It was on that basis that we decided we would move to the next phase, just prior to commercialisation, in January.  Crucial in this was the setting up of the ocean energy unit, and while I regret the delay, I feel we have set up the unit with the right people.  This is a crucial development which will allow us to spend money this year and catch up.  We need to catch up because this is an area in which there is major potential.  While I regret the delay in setting up the unit and the consequent inability to spend the various budgets, I believe we have got the unit and the strategy right, and the money will be spent this year or next to allow us to catch up.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Can I confirm that the Minister is saying that because only €1 million was spent out of the €26 million fund last year due to delays, which may be understandable, we are spending €7 million in 2009 on this initiative?  My understanding is that in 2010 we will be spending the remaining €18 million on funding ocean energy projects.  Is that correct?

It is probably the first and most crucial hurdle we need to overcome in the first half of this year so that companies that are investing significant moneys have real confidence in the planning system.  Budgets are important, but——
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Is the Minister committing a budget of €26 million over the next two years?

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	106	As well as providing valuable information for both the consumer and electricity supplier, net metering allows micro-scale renewable energy projects in domestic settings to export electricity to the grid.  The typical electricity meter installed by the ESB in the past will not operate in reverse and cannot therefore support a net metering programme.  The smart metering programme will resolve this barrier in time.  However, I am examining alternative ways of integrating micro-scale renewable energy systems into the electricity grid as soon as possible.An alternative approach is to provide a guaranteed price for electricity exported to the grid from micro-scale projects.  The renewable energy feed-in tariff, REFIT, support scheme operated by my Department provides a fixed price to electricity producers.  However, it also relies on electricity suppliers' voluntarily contracting with electricity producers to purchase the power produced.  Suppliers have demonstrated in the past that their interest is in purchasing power from large-scale projects producing electricity in commercial quantities only.  Micro-scale plants are of a much smaller size and require a different solution outside the REFIT programme.My Department is currently working closely with the Commission for Energy Regulation and other stakeholders to put in place in the short term an appropriately structured payment system for micro-generated electricity exported to the grid, which will operate separately from the REFIT mechanism.  In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland is proposing a micro-generation pilot programme under which research and field trials will be conducted, including support for between 50 and 60 installations of micro-scale projects on a pilot basis.  The field trials will address a range of issues, including grid connection and technical standards, to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.  CER and ESB Networks have amended the rules associated with connecting micro-scale plants so that generators of less than 6 kW on single-phase cables and 11 kW on three-phase electricity supply cables can now connect to the grid without prior authorisation.Following these changes, SEI has arranged to publish a guide to connecting renewable and combined heat and power electricity production plants to the electricity network, including advice for micro-generators, which will be of assistance to those connecting micro-scale plant to the network.  In addition, revised planning guidelines from my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government establish an exemption from planning consent requirements for micro-scale projects of suitable height.  Work is now concluding on the design of the programmes referred to and I expect to make an announcement on the detailed arrangements for micro-scale projects in the coming weeks.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I suspect I agree with the Minister when I say that micro-generation and the decentralisation of energy generation generally is a significant opportunity for job creation.  The key element of this is the export tariff that people can get by supplying power from micro-generators back to the electricity grid.  My understanding at the moment is that the proposition from the ESB is to pay 9 cent per kilowatt hour.  This does not compare favourably to what is on offer in other parts of Europe.  That is about as charitable as I can be.  In France, the equivalent figure is 45 cent per kilowatt hour.  We are a long way from agreement on the right tariff.  Will the Minister give his view on whether the recent ESB proposed tariff is appropriate?Second, the Minister is true to form with regard to net metering.  In November 2007, he announced that 25,000 homes would have net meters installed in a pilot project, while in September 2008 he said it would be 21,000 customers.  To date, how many smart meters have been installed and are functioning in homes?  Am I correct that under the timeframe the Minister has set we will have to wait until February 2011 to get some feedback on the findings of the pilot project in net metering?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I agree with the Deputy.  The 9 cent per kilowatt hour is there as an instrument to break the logjam that has existed for years whereby nobody would or could purchase the power.  Part of the measures we want to put in an interim package is that there would be a further price support measure which would complement that to provide an incentive.  It is just an interim measure.  We have also commissioned very detailed analysis of each of the small micro generation sectors to consider the more long-term, sustainable approach to encourage the development of this generation system.  The price we will put in will be an interim measure.  It will provide a more significant price support than the 9 cent referred to but it is, in itself, only an interim measure.We can examine Spain, Germany, France and the countries the Deputy mentioned to consider their experience.  What one does not wish to do, which has happened in some of those countries, is set a very high price and then undermine the market by having to claw that back or bring it down.  We must set an appropriate price that allows people, particularly dairy farmers, businesses and farms, to erect the windmills or other devices that would work very effectively in the Irish landscape and weather and give them an ability to sell on.  That price is only a fraction of what I believe the proper support price should and will be.Regarding net metering, I will refer back to the Deputy on the exact number of meters delivered to date, but we are on target for installing the 21,000 meters so we can test how householders use the meter and how it works.  That is the right way to do this.  People can criticise and say we should have installed 500,000 by now but my experience with a range of different projects in which we have engaged is that one first tests the item in the real world.  It is not a small test; a total of 21,000 houses is a significant sample of the population.  That will provide the figures and analysis that will allow us to deploy it across the country, which I am confident we will do.I am confident that we are ahead of other countries.  Members of the Opposition are critical that we are not further advanced but we are ahead of most other jurisdictions.  Crucially, we are ahead in terms of learning from the mistakes.  Other countries have installed smart meters but the meters were not necessarily as smart as they would have liked two or three years later.  It is appropriate for us to get it right, and that is what we are doing.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	109	My understanding, and the Minister can correct me if it is wrong, is that only 250 of the 21,000 have so far been installed.  While I am anxious to support the roll-out of smart meters, as are many other people because it leads to other technologies, the problem is that we are utterly frustrated by how long each stage is taking before smart meters will be commercial after the pilot project phase.  It will be 2012 or 2013 at the earliest.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	110	In conjunction with the roll-out of micro-generation here, we will provide access to 4,000 of the smart meters we have available to farmers, small businesses or householders who might wish to generate their own power supply and sell it back to the grid.  We will provide that on a basis that it gets rid of that as a block to the development of micro-generation.  We are using the smart meters which are available to us and which we can deploy in a way that kills two birds with one stone — it develops a new power supply system whereby people can supply power to the grid and provides lessons that we can then apply to the rest of the country.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The development and expansion of the natural gas network is, in the first instance, a commercial matter for Bord Gáis Éireann, BGE, which is mandated under section 8 of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas that is both economical and efficient.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is a statutory, independent body, has, since 2002, been charged with all aspects of the assessment and licensing of prospective operators who wish to develop and-or operate a gas distribution system within the State under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  I have no direct statutory function in the connection of towns to the gas network.The CER in 2006 approved a new network connections policy, which created the opportunity to reassess the feasibility of connecting certain towns to the gas network.  In order for any town to be connected to the gas network, certain economic criteria need to be satisfied as a prerequisite.  This is to ensure that, over a certain period, the costs of connecting the town to the network are recouped through the actual consumption of gas and the associated tariffs.  The policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.In this context, BGE is carrying out a comprehensive assessment of towns not already connected to the national gas network.  I am advised that Ballina and Newport in north Tipperary are already connected to the natural gas network.  Nenagh, Roscrea and Thurles are included in a total of 42 towns being examined as part of phase three of this assessment, which is scheduled for completion in April this year.  BGE's final report will outline which towns or groups of towns would be economically viable for connection, within the revised connection policy criteria.  In the event that the appraisal indicates that Nenagh, Roscrea or Thurles are viable for connection, I am advised that it may be possible to assess additional towns in close proximity in that context.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I am disappointed that the Minister started his reply by stating he has no responsibility for this and that it is a commercial matter for Bord Gáis Éireann.  Preliminary results from the analysis carried out by DKM indicate subvention from the State will be required to have gas delivered to the towns of Thurles, Nenagh and Roscrea.  According to the report, a sum of €11 million will be required in the case of Thurles, but it is only €3 million if it is linked with Callan and Tipperary town or a cluster of towns.The Minister should not hide behind Bord Gáis.  The Government must put facilities in rural Ireland that facilitate job creation and competition and enable industry to thrive and prosper in those areas.  Will the Minister's Department commit money under the national development plan to enable the IDA, which is promoting industry in the area, to put money into those schemes for towns such as Thurles, Nenagh and Roscrea?  Will the Government rise to the occasion and ensure there is competitive infrastructure in rural areas like elsewhere in Ireland?  Industries such as creameries and bakeries are at a disadvantage of possibly 30% when compared to similar industries in other counties that have the facility of natural gas.  Will the Minister indicate that the Government is committed to supplying the funds to enable Bord Gáis, as it wishes and is prepared to do, to provide this infrastructure in north Tipperary?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I would be happy to see gas being provided to Tipperary, Thurles, Callan or any of the towns mentioned.  However, we must revert to the discussion we had earlier.  We must keep our electricity and energy prices low and competitive.  It would be easy to come to this side of the House and take on responsibility for the allocation of infrastructure such as this if one could promise it left, right and centre and disregard the actual cost to the consumer at the end.  If a grid was built to an area where there might not be an economic case for doing so, and I am not saying that is the case in any of those towns, it would put the price of gas and electricity up for every other town.  Any Member of the Opposition would scream foul and point out that the gas prices were too high.  That is why this issue is left within the regulatory system and Bord Gáis.  It is not a political decision.  It is better that it is done on an assessment of how to keep prices low as well as providing the obvious benefits of gas for manufacturing, bakeries and so forth.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot scream prices are too high and in the next breath scream that the grid must be built to a place where it might not be economical but might bring other benefits.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I do not accept the Minister's analogy.  Infrastructure must be put in place to attract people and industry to an area.  What was the cost of the 35 jobs that were lost in Taylor Made, Templemore, yesterday because of energy prices, following the 24 lost last December?  That is a total of 59 job losses.  What is the cost of that to the State?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I want to bring gas to those locations to bring the cost of energy down to help people keep their jobs.  However, in doing so, one must be careful that one does not cause jobs to be lost in another town because the price of its gas connection is increased.  There is a complex algorithm and a complex balancing act that must be done to meeting the economic objectives of having a wider gas network, at the same time keeping our gas prices low so that we hold on to the jobs we have.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	116	We need equal treatment in rural Ireland.  We do not want all the money spent within the Pale.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	117	A total of 58 of the 60 phase II MANs, which provide state-of-the-art, fibre, open access networks to 64 towns across the country are now completed.  Construction of the Edenderry network will be completed this year while the Kinsale network will be constructed in parallel with planned main drainage works next year.All completed phase II networks are being managed, maintained and operated on an interim basis by the technical services firm Magnum Opus on behalf of my Department.  Magnum Opus will manage the phase II MANs until such time as a management services entity is engaged for the phase II MANs — MSE 2.The engagement of MSE 2 is currently the subject of a procurement process, which is expected to conclude before the end of March 2009.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  Previous initiatives such as the Global Crossing deal, the group broadband scheme, grant aiding ESBT, and MANs phase I, as well as current initiatives such as Project Kelvin, the national broadband scheme and MANs phase II, have all underpinned the pro-competition policies that are now bearing fruit.Policies built on the cornerstone of competition provide the investment certainty that the electronic communications market needs.  Service providers fully understand that Government intervention, by way of funding infrastructure, will only occur where the market has failed to bridge a digital divide.Such policy and intervention initiatives, including phase II of the MANs programme have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 60% of Irish households now have a broadband connection.  ComReg's quarterly report for Q3 2008 states that 61.1% of those households have a connection in the speed category of 2 -10 mbps.  At the end of Q1 2008, 83% of Irish SMEs had a broadband connection.  Over 70% of those SMEs, according to ComReg's report, have a connection in the speed category of 2-10 mbps.It is important to consider the MANs in the context of these market developments.  They have provided all service providers with access to local markets and encouraged the roll-out of DSL in the relevant towns.  They have assisted the IDA in the attraction of foreign direct investment and, more recently, are being considered by mobile broadband operators who wish to deepen the fibre in their networks to cater for the rapidly increasing demand for bandwidth by mobile users.While information regarding the revenue generated from the phase II MANs is commercially sensitive and I do not propose to release details of the revenue generated at this time, I do believe that the MANs will play an ever increasing, and crucially important, role in our competitive electronic communications market.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	118	I would appreciate it if the Minister could stick to the question, which is specifically about the metropolitan area networks phase II.  We can have the debate on some of the other issues the Minister raised on another day.My concern here is that in July last the Department chose a preferred bidder to manage MANs phase 11.  Some 58 metropolitan area networks under phase II are completed.  It has cost the State approximately €80 million to provide that infrastructure.  The Minister tells us, because it is convenient for him, that he cannot tell us the revenue he is getting from that €80 million of expenditure on the 58 MANs that are waiting to be lit up and add backbone to the broadband infrastructure across the country.The reason the vast majority of them are not being used at all is that we do not have an entity managing this infrastructure on behalf of the State.  I asked the Minister last November why his Department had not signed a management contract to allow the preferred bidder — or somebody else, I do not mind — to manage that infrastructure on behalf of the State.MANs phase I is bringing in a great deal of money to the Government in terms of usage.  The MANs phase I are being used by all broadband providers in Ireland with the exception of one or two, yet MANs phase II, at a cost of €80 million, is not being used at all.  The MANs phase II are not being managed properly because the Minister and his Department are delaying putting a management contract in place.  Why is that delay continuing?

He now states that we will not see it until the end of March because he wants to get a better deal for the taxpayer.  The taxpayer is losing by the day because we do not have a satisfactory broadband infrastructure across the country, partly because we have a great many wires and fibre in the ground that are not being used because of delays in the Minister's office.Maybe he could tell us how many of the 58 MANs phase II under interim management are being used at present.  He stated they are available for use and I dispute that.  How many of the 58 are being used and why is the Department delaying putting a contract in place for the proper management of this expensive piece of broadband infrastructure?

As the Deputies are aware development of this renewable energy source is at the very early stages and will require considerable research to bring it to fruition as a general source of energy.  In this regard I launched the multi-annual ocean energy package last year.  While I accept that progress in 2008 was somewhat slower than targeted I can report that significant progress has been made in completing the necessary preliminary tasks to ensure the proper functioning and financial management of the programme.The ocean energy development unit base has been established within Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI.  This unit will manage the ocean energy strategy and generally administer the scheme.Since its establishment the unit has invested significantly in the creation of a state-of-the-art national ocean energy facility in University College Cork.  The unit is also managing the development of a grid-connected wave energy test site off the west coast.  It has also commenced the ocean energy prototype fund, which will assist research projects in this area.  The first tranche of applications and allocations from the fund will be decided within a matter of weeks.  In addition, I have also announced the introduction of a new feed-in-tariff under the REFIT scheme for wave and tidal technologies of €220 per megawatt hour, which will be available to future full-scale projects connected to the grid.The unit has also established an advisory group comprising my Department, the CER, the Coastal Zone Managing Authority, Enterprise Ireland, EirGrid, ESB Networks, IDA Ireland, the Marine Institute and Science Foundation Ireland, to co-ordinate the activities of these agencies in developing and delivering an efficient roadmap for ocean energy.The ocean energy development unit has also commenced work to deliver studies of common interest to the sector including a study on the engineering and specialist support requirements for the sector in order to enhance Ireland's capability to maximise participation in the construction and operation of wave and tidal systems; a review of the planning regime for ocean energy development, a strategic environmental assessment for ocean energy in Irish waters, to investigate partnership with industry for data gathering and processing, and a detailed review of the macroeconomic benefits that ocean energy can deliver for Ireland.Expenditure in 2008, at just over €1 million, reflects the fact that each of the component measures was in the process of being established and I am advised that this pace will accelerate and the full allocation of €7 million in 2009 will be spent.I am confident that delivery of the Government targets of 75 MW by 2012 and 500 MW by 2020 — which should be seen as the base of our ambitions, not a limit on them — from ocean energy technologies will be enabled as the current research and prototype development and that Ireland's considerable potential in this area can be realised.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Does the Minister accept the gulf between his rhetoric and his record is such that it leaves him vulnerable to criticism?  When he launched this so-called €26 million programme on ocean energy in January 2008, he said he was setting out to ensure Ireland would win the race in establishing a viable ocean energy device.  Will he not accept that other countries are in the process of winning that race and that we have failed in regard to the first ambition the Minister set out for himself?  He said we had the most sophisticated State-support system for ocean energy in the world.  He has not been able to get his unit up and running in time to spend the €5 million he was supposed to spend last year, so sophisticated is his record in terms of support.Will the Minister outline exactly how the €26 million will be spent?  He has already lost one year, where he has spent only €1 million.  This year he is talking about €7 million; what is the situation as regards the following year, 2010?I have a specific question, too, on the applications, which were sought only in November by the Department.  How many applications have been sought, how many proposals have been received and what is the funding available for them?

Has he not got the wherewithal to ensure we are the world's leading experts in this area?  This is something that is natural to this country.  We, on the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, have prepared legislation in this regard because we do not even have modern legislation to deal with this.  This legislation got buried until people such as myself and others started to make noises.  Is the Government serious about the €16 billion investment in this area?  Is it serious about getting this up and running?  Ireland is an island stuck in the Atlantic, where we have natural resources second to none.  Can he not please show us action to ensure we become the leading country in the world in this area?

They are working with international utilities and investors that are seriously considering investment in Ireland.  We have to get a number of measures right for that.  The budget figures are important, but they are not the crucial constraints.  What Deputy Barrett says is true.  The first thing they want is certainty around planning and community support.  When one talks to the companies considering investment here, these are the first issues about which they are concerned.  In that regard, I am confident we have the right people in the ocean energy unit.  It may be some months late, but I prefer to get the right people in and the right strategy in place while taking the type of advice we are being given on the planning side, and putting that into action.

The crucial test for us is getting community support behind it because that is what the investors need in terms of confidence about planning and getting our planning system right.  The ocean energy unit within our Department, in conjunction with others, is charged with delivering on that task.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I want to give the Taoiseach some credit today.  I was glad to hear him speak a piece of his mind last week.  He spoke so well that he caused some type of media frenzy, a type of love-in of the words of the Taoiseach.  If it was not so serious, it would be great.  The fact we have more than 326,000 people out of work, that there is a crisis of confidence in the banking system and no sign of a visible plan or strategy from Government means desperation for hundreds of thousands of families.  A person rang me after the Taoiseach's contribution and said that if Deputy Brian Cowen made two more speeches like that the recession would be over.  If matters were not as serious as they are, that would be funny.The Taoiseach made some fundamentally important points in that contribution, such as understanding who we are, what the national interest is, engaging, listening to people, working in solidarity and co-ordination in order to move Ireland out of the financial and economic crisis.  One of the methods being adopted by Government is the pension levy.  I want the Taoiseach to understand that, given the extent of the cutbacks and savings required, the Fine Gael Party agrees with the figure of €2 billion put up by the Government.  All sections of society, particularly the public sector, which did not cause the problem but is being asked to pay for the majority of it, are willing to play their part in moving the economy out of the crisis caused by the mismanagement of Government over the years. It appears to me, from talking to a broad range of people, that they are prepared to play their part, but they want the system to be fair and balanced.  It is clear, however, that anomalies have arisen from the Government's conclusions and the announcement of the pension levy scheme.  The lower paid are being crucified as a consequence of the pension levy, and there are examples of those on higher earnings having to pay less than some on lower incomes.In the interests of what the Taoiseach said last week about fairness, engagement, solidarity, listening and pulling the country out of the mess, does he believe the contributions now expected as a consequence of the pension levy scheme are fair and balanced?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	165	The question of fairness can be an objective or subjective matter.  I do not deny for a moment that this is an imposition on public service workers.   It is set against a context in which adjustments are being made across all sectors of the economy, including the private sector, to deal with an unprecedented situation.I must emphasise the seriousness of the situation in which we find ourselves and the need to continue working through it.  The €2 billion in savings that were announced are a signal of the further measures which will have to be taken.  We have indicated how we will go about doing that both in terms of the committee looking at public service numbers and expenditure in all areas in the public service and the report of the Commission on Taxation, which I am sure will make important recommendations.What is important for us to realise is that we are in a new situation and are unlikely to return to the high levels of growth we saw in the past.  We can return to growth as soon as the upturn comes provided we take the right steps in the meantime.  One of the matters we have to address is the position of the public finances.  This is not only important in its own right — we had this debate last week — but also in terms of retaining the maximum number of jobs and maintaining and rebuilding confidence in the economy both internally and externally.  The issue of external confidence is important in the context of the financial crisis with which we are all trying to contend.We have to take these steps and send these signals.  Although they represent an imposition, they are progressive in the sense that the levy increases from 3% to 7.5% on average and almost 10% at the highest end.  While there was no agreement at the end of the day, it was agreed in principle that €2 billion is the amount with which we need to deal at present, that the question of public service pay and pensions provided us with the means by which many of these savings would be identified and that we need to continue working on a range of other necessary issues as we try to identify further savings and taxation measures which can help us address the gap in the public finances.  That was the motivation behind what we did and why we did it, and why this is an important part but not the full response.  It is mirrored in other sectors of the economy where job security is at risk and jobs are being lost.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Part of the reason for introducing the measure is because there has been no clear strategy from the Government on how to sort this out.  It brought forward its budget last year and made proposals which it was forced to reverse because of public embarrassment and pressure.  It launched another economic document before Christmas and now we are where we are.The question I asked the Taoiseach was whether he considers the proposals from the Government on the pension levy to be fair and balanced.  I will provide three examples.  In regard to single taxpayers, John earns €15,000.  His net reduction in take home pay will be €450, or a cut of 3%.  His cousin works up the road and earns €19,500.  His net reduction in take home pay will be €105 because given the nature of the taxation system, he pays 0.5%.  A single public servant who earns €36,400 will have his or her pay reduced by €1,769 per annum, whereas a single person earning €40,000 will have a reduction of €1,649.  The take home pay of a married person earning €45,400 will be reduced by €2,537, whereas if one earns €55,000, one's take home will only be reduced by €2,403.  These are clear anomalies in a system that is not fair or balanced.Yesterday, I listened to 250 public service workers whose anger was focused on the unfairness and imbalance of this measure.  There is no desire for social unrest or industrial disputes.  The Taoiseach rightly said last week that he is prepared to listen and, if possible, to tweak the scheme to allow for progress.  In view of the anomalies which impact on thousands of cases of low paid workers or at the lower end of the public sector and for those above and below the marginal rate, in respect of whom a difference now applies, is the Taoiseach prepared to tweak the proposal put forward by the Government in the interest of fairness and balance and to avoid social unrest, industrial disputes and frustration and consternation?What is the Government's accurate assessment of the savings to be made from the scheme?  There were reports of €2 billion, a figure which was subsequently reduced to just over €1 billion.  What is the actual figure as assessed by the Government?

He will find that some of the suggested anomalies will not in fact exist when all considerations and the various credits and allowances are taken into account.In regard to the amounts, the estimated savings take into account the revenue lost on the other side.  In the stabilisation update we submitted to the European Commission, we have allowed for the loss of revenue represented by the imposition of the levy where that saving of €2 billion is involved.  The figures take account of the loss of revenue this represents in terms of reduced wages and, therefore, less tax being paid as a result of the pension levy being introduced.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	168	One of the proposals which the Labour Party has been putting forward in order to address the serious economic difficulties which the country and working families are facing is a guarantee for families that they will not lose their homes during the period of this recession.  To be fair, it appears that the Government has taken up this proposal in some way and has discussed it with the financial institutions.  It is reported today that the Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank are prepared to delay issuing repossession orders on homes for 12 months.  That is not good enough because all it does is put off the evil day for 12 months.  It is not sufficient time because, as was noted this morning by Michael Culloty from MABS and echoed at lunchtime by John Monaghan from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a period of two to three years is required so that people can have some reassurance that their family homes will not be repossessed.In any event, the idea of delaying the inevitable repossession for 12 months misses the point that people who are losing their jobs or are worried about doing so have the additional worry of losing their homes and they need reassurance.  That reassurance needs to be provided by the Government securing an arrangement with the financial institutions.I ask the Taoiseach two questions.  First, what arrangements is the Government discussing with the financial institutions which have already been provided with a blanket State guarantee, and which are to be recapitalised in some instances, in respect of their policies on the repossession of homes?  Second, can he give security and a sense of safety to families by reassuring them that their homes will not be repossessed, having regard to the arrangements he is discussing with the financial institutions, the considerable resources the State is now making available to recapitalise banks and underpin the financial institutions of the State and the existing arrangements for rent allowance and mortgage interest subsidy?The basic point is that families need reassurance.  That is distinct from simply being told the letter in the post is going to be delayed for six or 12 months.  People need reassurance that they will not lose their homes during the period between their losing their jobs, getting another job and getting back on their feet and the return of the period of economic growth about which the Taoiseach has spoken.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Part of the purpose of the discussions on this matter is to provide reassurance to people who work honestly and reasonably, taking account of changed circumstances, with the bank or lender to reschedule mortgage arrangements that there will be no precipitative effort by financial institutions, including those outside the voluntary code who must now, in my opinion, sign-up to the statutory code, to repossess their homes.  We are requiring that all lending institutions act in a humane and sensible manner on the basis that we wish to provide that reassurance to mortgage holders.  In practice, assurance is given in the normal course of events that every effort will be made to avoid repossessions.  This is evidenced by the low level of repossessions to date, the latest figure for which is 0.3% of the more than 1 million mortgages in the country.It is important that the code be put on a statutory footing.  This will provide protection and reassurance.  Also, the code must be comprehensive.  Obviously, the financial institutions must find the most humane way possible of dealing with the situation while distinguishing between those who can pay and those who will not pay.  Those who cannot pay because of changed circumstances will be dealt with in a way that is reasonable and correct in the circumstances.  That is the basis upon which the discussions are ongoing.

This is about those who cannot pay.  There are plenty of ways in which those who will not pay can be dealt with.  In any event, the mortgage must be repaid at some stage.  Let us be clear, this is about people who cannot pay and people who fear that they will not be able to pay.

People have either lost their jobs, are afraid they will lose their jobs or their income is down and they are worrying about how they are going to make repayments on their homes and about the day somebody will come knocking on their door, mandatory code or not, to repossess their home.The Taoiseach stated that there have not been many repossessions to date but some homes have been repossessed.  There have many more repossessions of homes than of sites and half finished speculative developments, some of which are the subject of what are now known as bad debts and bad loans.

We have one set of laws in respect of big borrowings for large developments, which are deemed part of the bad debt problem the State had to guarantee and in respect of which it must now recapitalise the banks.  We appear to have a regime which is about to recapitalise big loans and repossess in respect of small loans.  Saying there have not been many repossessions is not sufficient because there has been a very substantial number of voluntary surrenders.  The hammer is put on people who cannot pay and they are effectively forced into surrendering the dwelling to the financial institution.  This does not make sense.Ultimately, when a family loses its home, the State must step in and provide rent allowance and so on.  What is the financial institution to do with such dwelling?  It cannot sell it in the current market.  It makes sense for a whole pile of reasons that there is a regime in place that ensures homes are not repossessed.  A formula must be agreed that allows the Taoiseach or any other Member of the House when speaking to worried families about the prospect of their home being repossessed to reassure them that for the next two or three years or during difficult times their homes will not be repossessed.  People will still have to repay the mortgage but we should put in place a formula which helps them to get through such times.  This, apart from reassuring people about not losing their homes, would provide the type of security and reassurance that might encourage people to spend again, which would have a knock-on effect on the economy.  This is about more than just saying repossession orders will be delayed.  This is about providing confidence and security to families who are worried about how they will pay mortgages, many of which are greater than the value of the dwellings on the market.

Deputy Gilmore is asking me to predict what will be the performance of individual loans, be they residential or commercial mortgages.  That cannot be predicted in the here and now.  The suggestion is being made that provision is made for bad debts before they become such.  We must be careful and point out, in the interests of maintaining confidence and providing an accurate picture of the current situation, that where debts become bad, provision is made for them.

What I am saying in respect of the latter is that reassurance will be provided.  People who make contact, as they have been doing up to now — one must take into consideration the rate of possessions taking place despite current difficulties — will be able to put in place rescheduling or interest only arrangements and may agree to have arrears recapitalised onto the main mortgage amount.  As stated, it is in the interests of the mortgage holder and the lender to find an arrangement which meets the current circumstances of the parties concerned.As Deputy Gilmore stated, institutions are aware the housing market is not good.  Their ability to take on assets for the purpose of disposal is not a good mark.  It is better for them to work with the people and to assist them through the next number of months or years when they are in difficulty.  That is in practice what the lending institutions, in their own interests quite apart from the wider public interest, have to and will do.  It is a question of providing reassurance in terms of the statutory code and what practice arrangements will be in place.  To make the argument that in some way that is not something we should be concerned with or that we are not trying to address is not correct.  We are seeking to address that issue in a way that provides confidence that the performing loans are performing and those which are not, in particular in respect of private residences, will be dealt with in a humane and sensible fashion.

The level of information we get on the capital budgets and their performance against criteria of performance is hopeless.  The Dáil is in the dark as to whether projects are on time, ahead of time, behind time or on budget.

At this point in time, we do not have that specific detail.

Will the Taoiseach clarify the position?

The first is the Bill to give effect to the so-called pensions levy.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House when that Bill will be introduced in the House and what is his timetable for its enactment?  Can the Taoiseach tell us if the heads of the Bill have been approved by the Government and, if so, will the Government publish them?  There is much uncertainty as to what exactly the Government is proposing in regard to this levy, to what incomes it will apply and from what date it will apply.  Will Taoiseach give the House the information in this regard?Second, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has announced there will be spending limits for the local elections this year and that they will apply for a period of 60 days before the local elections, which means they will apply from 5 April or thereabouts.  I welcome this because it is something the Labour Party has been advocating for some time.  The limits announced are not quite as low as the Labour Party would have liked but, in any event, I welcome the fact they have been announced.  There is a need for legislation to give effect to this and presumably this will have to be passed in good time before 5 April, when the limits will apply.  Will the Taoiseach tell us when the legislation will be published and introduced to give effect to the spending limits?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	197	As the Deputy said, the decision on the limits was taken today by Government so the legislative work will now begin and will be conducted in such a way as to make it effective for the forthcoming local elections this year.  The intention would be to introduce it in a timely manner.With regard to the statutory arrangements being put in place for the pensions levy, the heads of the Bill were considered by Government today.  It is intended that it will come before Cabinet again very quickly, be published, brought to the House and enacted as a matter of urgency, because it is important it is enacted quickly.  We intend that it would be effective from next month.

Given what the Taoiseach said on the agreement of the heads of the Bill, when is it likely the detail of its contents will be agreed by the Government and when is it likely to be published?  I suggest to the Taoiseach that when the Government has approved the heads of the Bill, the heads themselves should be published so the maximum of information is available at the earliest possible time as to what is intended.Finally, will the Taoiseach clarify the issue about the date?  From when will the pension levy apply?  Will it apply from a future date following the enactment of legislation or from the date it is announced in the House?  From when will it apply?

Has the Taoiseach given regard to the torrent of correspondence sent directly to his office, only a fraction of which, I suspect, has been copied to us?

The Minister for Social and Family Affairs is distancing herself from responsibility for the community welfare service, which is currently vested in the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the HSE.  However, the Government and the Taoiseach might recall we enacted the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007, which transferred responsibility for this service from the HSE to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Is this still Government policy?  When will the commencement order be signed, or has the Government changed its mind on this matter?

Entering a nursing home or a long-term care facility can be a source of significant anxiety and upset for older people and their families, neighbours and friends.  At present, there are some 7,700 people in public long-term residential care and a further 15,200 people in private nursing homes.  The legislation will make arrangements for financial support for almost 23,000 people who need long-term, comprehensive care.Under the present system of nursing home subvention, some older people and their families undergo real financial hardship to pay for the cost of care.  This can include having to sell or remortgage homes.  It can put families under major financial and emotional strain as they seek the funds to pay for an elderly person's care; it is a particular strain on sons and daughters with young families.  Under the new fair deal people will be asked to contribute to the cost of their care according to their means.  This system is fair and it treats older people equally regardless of whether they are in public or private nursing homes.Under the new arrangements people requiring residential care will be assessed to calculate their ability to contribute to care.  Under the scheme, people requiring long-term residential care will contribute 80% of their assessable income, including pensions, whether for public or private nursing home care.  Depending on the amount of a person's assessable income, there may also be a contribution of up to 5% of a person's assets.  The system allows for flexibility as payment can be deferred until the settlement of the person's estate.  This is a welcome measure in the Bill.  This system is fair as no one will pay more than the cost of their care.  Furthermore, people have the freedom to choose from an approved private or public nursing home.While I welcome the provision for older people in residential care, I firmly believe that if older people so wish, they should be supported to live in their own homes for as long as is possible and feasible.  I welcome the major investment in the largest expansion ever of services for older people.  A few years ago, almost no older person received nursing or therapy care at home.  This service was available only in a hospital or a nursing home.  Last year, over 10,000 people benefited from home care.  In addition to home care packages, we have expanded home help hours by more than 500,000 hours.  In 2007, approximately 53,000 people were receiving home help services.  Over 11.75 million home help hours were provided during 2007.  Since 2004, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Government have increased the budget for services for older people by €540 million.I welcome the increase in nursing homes in Kildare which the Health Service Executive, HSE, regularly registers and inspects.  It is good that clients can now choose their nursing home and that their families can be updated by downloading the home's inspection reports.  In Kildare, there are more than ten nursing homes, over half of which are in rural areas.  Location is important to patients and families.  I welcome the location of nursing homes in rural areas where patients can enjoy a rural setting for their twilight years.  Patients also want to be near family and friends.In my local authority area, the council has pursued a policy of refusing permission for nursing homes on the edges of towns and villages, preferring to locate them in their centres notwithstanding the success of those located in rural areas.  At the end of last year, the Minister opened a new nursing home on the edge of Maynooth which provides a quality service to that community and its patients and provides badly needed local jobs, equivalent to those provided by a medium-sized factory.  Making more beds available will free up our acute hospital beds and allow our senior citizens to live near their families and friends in comfortable surroundings.Residential care facilities are very important but we must realise that only approximately 5% of older people ever need them.  They are usually required after a spell in hospital, when the patient is ready to leave the hospital but is not quite well enough to manage at home alone.  They can also be the best option for an older person who is rendered incapable of living alone by illness or disability.  I welcome the work of the hospitals, nursing staff and HSE in securing nursing home places for elderly patients.  The HSE provides a wide range of designated support for people in their own homes but at times when these people need nursing home care, it can be hard to know what is available and to what one is entitled.  The forum for older people, set up in 2006 and comprising almost all of the major national organisations with a special interest and expertise in services to older people, including the Department of Health and Children, the HSE, the National Council for Aging and Older People and many other organisations, provides a valuable service.  The forum has developed proposals for service developments which dramatically improve the quality of life of people in residential units.The provision of nursing home places and home care packages is only part of a comprehensive range of services to older people.  It is important that we do not consider the service in isolation and that there are also home help and day care services, and domiciliary care centres.  Furthermore, there is also a range of primary care services such as GP services, public nursing services, etc.  We must prioritise improved support for expansion of community-based supports and improvements in the quality and availability of hospital and residential care.Older people are a core priority for Fianna Fáil in Government.  Last year, for the first time, we appointed a Minister of State with cross-departmental responsibility for older people.  The health service is undergoing its biggest reform since the foundation of the State but improvements are being made.  There are real problems yet to be overcome, however, for those awaiting service and their families.Contrary to some commentary, most of those working in nursing homes, hospitals and community-based facilities provide an excellent service which at times is not recognised.  We need them and it is important to recognise their service.  Sometimes we hear about hospital-acquired infection.  The Health Information Quality Authority, HIQA, national hygiene services review is welcome particularly for its findings on service delivery which validate the focus of the HSE on hygiene in the past two years.  The HSE has recently put in place a significant number of strategic, structural and governance initiatives.  Much good work has been undertaken and positive assessments made of hospital hygiene and, in particular, of service delivery areas such as hand hygiene, equipment, medical and cleaning devices.The Bill is fundamental to meeting the commitment given in Towards 2016 that support should be equal for public and private care recipients.  It offered assurances to the most vulnerable groups in our society, those in need of long-term nursing home care, that such care would be, and remain, affordable as long as it was needed.

The Minister and the Government have been correct in taking their time to ensure that any legal or other impediments have been dealt with.This debate may highlight other issues that might require changes to the legislation.  I trust that the Minister and her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Máire Hoctor, will closely follow the debate and take on board positive proposals from all sides of the House.  There is great interest in this measure among Members of all parties who all have, as public representatives, dealt with the various issues raised in the legislation, and in many cases have had to confront them within their family circumstances.The care of our ageing population is one of the most important issues that we will face in this century and is a political and societal challenge.  The issues involved vary from pension provision to medical care and residential care.  The residential care element is probably the most important because it has such a significant impact on the person as well as on his or her partner and on their extended family.  The system of nursing home subvention clearly needs reforming.  A scheme that covers only 40% of the cost of private nursing home care is not sustainable and is thankfully being replaced by this much more workable and supportive alternative.We can all list examples in our own constituencies of families who have had to borrow heavily or sell the family home to offset the cost of care for an elderly relative.  This Bill will negate the need to do this and I warmly welcome this initiative by the Government.In assessing the need for this legislative change, we must reflect on the numbers of elderly people being cared for within the system.  There are approximately 7,700 people in public long-term residential care and just over 15,000 people in private nursing homes.  To cater for them, the HSE has over 10,000 public beds in residential care centres for older people across the country.  In addition, the HSE partially finances 9,000 beds, "subvented beds", 3,000 of which are fully financed contract beds.  These were secured between 2005 and 2008.  Last year, the HSE indicated a strong commitment to providing over 800 public fast-track beds before the end of this year — more than half of which were to be in place at or before the end of 2008.  This six-fold increase in Government spending clearly signifies its strong commitment to providing for the care of elderly people in society.The provision of funding is not in itself an adequate response to the needs of the aged, and it has been clear for some considerable time that the State needs to reorganise the way in which it supports long-term residential elder care.  It is deeply unfair that people were faced with hugely varying costs for nursing home care, depending on where they lived, or whether the nursing home was in public or private ownership.  Under this new measure, families will have a certainty and consistency, something that is definitely not available to them under the current arrangement.  This security is something which older people and their families require.  The enactment of this Bill will bring with it  a new peace of mind to many elderly people up and down the country, a peace of mind which will ultimately be beneficial for their personal health and well being.  At the moment, nobody is charged more than 80% of the non-contributory pension for care in a public nursing home, regardless of income.  However, the costs were quite substantial in the private nursing home sector, even allowing for subvention.  This anomaly had to be put right and the Government will thankfully bring equity to the situation with this Bill.  The pressures placed on family members to provide care for a dependent relative were extremely difficult and at times overwhelming, leading to financial hardship in many cases.I commend the Minister on bringing forward this Bill, the benefits of which will be felt for decades to come.  There was a clear need to address the situation and we are now in a position to deal with the matter effectively and decisively.  The requirement to reform the manner in which nursing home provision is subvented has been apparent for a considerable time, but the manner in which nursing homes are managed and regulated was highlighted by the RTE exposé on the Leas Cross nursing home in north county Dublin.  I pay tribute to Deputy Fergus O'Dowd for the work he has done in highlighting the inadequacy of the service in many nursing homes around the country.This Bill requires all nursing homes to be registered.  The Health Information and Quality Authority will be responsible for the monitoring and inspection of nursing homes, based on the provisions of the Health Act 2007, and taking into account the recent draft report on quality standards presented to the Minister.  The combined objective of all those involved in this process must be to ensure that we provide residential conditions that are nurturing and supportive, and where the care available to elderly and dependent people is verifiably of the highest possible standards.  These standards will apply to both public and private nursing homes and will address the safety and financial concerns of many families in caring for their loved ones in long-term dependency situations.In the period since the Leas Cross revelations, significant progress has been made by the HSE in the development of its elder abuse programme.  The initiatives rolled out include the appointment of 29 senior case workers nationwide; the establishment of a  national steering committee to oversee the provision of HSE elder abuse services in detection, reporting and response; improved training for staff; and the development of a public awareness campaign aimed at informing people on the risks and realties of elder abuse.  These initiatives will ensure the prevention of elder abuse in public and private care facilities, but the care and attention of families and the wider community must also be a factor in tackling such horrendous abuse.One of the key decisions we have to make in the provision of long-term care facilities is on their location, to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred.  A number of homes have been built or are proposed to be built in rural locations around County Kildare.  This has led to some controversy as to the merits of such proposals.  In its recently published annual report, An Bord Pleanála stated:A number of large scale nursing homes have been proposed in isolated greenfield sites remote from towns or villages, shops or services of any description.  Invariably, these have been refused by the board, as it is considered that such facilities are best located within existing settlements where public services are available and where the occupants have some degree of access to shops and other amenities, or can walk up the street and encounter members of the local community.Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I do not entirely share the board's views on this matter.  We should not be too prescriptive in this area.  I feel that, as in many areas of life, variety is key.  Many people who have lived in the countryside all their lives would much prefer to look out onto a green field than on an urban scene.  Alternatively, many people would still like to be able to access the local shops, post office, pub or betting shop if they are fortunate enough to enjoy relatively good health in later life.Therefore, quality and variety of location are very important.  Placing someone who has lived in Dublin, or in any of the other large urban centres, in a nursing home in a rural location can cause huge difficulties for the person and his or her family, who may find it difficult to access such a location.  Planners, developers, advocates for older people and the HSE need to work more closely to ensure that a full range of facilities are available to our aging population.Much more needs to be done by those working in the planning system to provide trading down opportunities for older people and in particular, to encourage the provision of retirement complexes in which independent or supported living conditions are available. Kildare County Council has undertaken a study, through its strategic policy committee on economic planning and development, on the provision and location of elderly care facilities within the county.  The Minister should conduct a national review on the same issues.This Bill will have wide ranging effects on so many people in the coming years that it is one of the most important Bills to come before this Dáil.  Therefore, it is vitally important that we frame it by taking as many points of view on board as possible.  The title "fair deal" indicates this will be fair to the elderly, fair to their families and fair to the taxpayer.I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and their officials for the work they have done in bringing the Bill before us, and I commend it to the House.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	231	This is a very important debate, which deals with the future of those people currently in nursing homes, as well as with our own future.  It is about where we and our families will end up, not just those fine people — some 30,000 of them — who currently reside in nursing homes.Sickness comes to us all, and none of us will live forever.  The Department estimates that 4.6% of the current population over 65 are in nursing home care.  The total proportion of those who ultimately end up in nursing homes is comparatively quite small.  By trying to keep our people out of nursing home care and by having effective, efficient, committed and dedicated community teams to look after our senior citizens, we will keep that number as low as possible.  Nobody willingly wants to go into nursing home care, while two thirds of those in such care are deemed to be highly dependent.The fatal flaw in this Bill is that it does not deal with the fundamental issue of sharing the cost burden of the nursing home.  The penalty for being sick when elderly falls on the individual who happens to get ill.  It does not respect such a person's income, qualifications or family background.  Everybody who ends up in a nursing home must pay the costs, or else their family pays them.  This Bill makes sure that if somebody is not lucky enough to have the money to pay for nursing home care, then 15% of the sale of that person's house plus a proportion of the person's assets per annum will go towards paying for his or her care.  That is fundamentally wrong and unjust.How we treat people in our society, especially the very young and the very old, indicates the value we place on the most vulnerable.  Nobody is arguing that the cost of a long-term stay of a child in hospital should come out of the family income.  Nobody is arguing that a women having a child in a hospital should pay for the child birth if she does not have health insurance.  The State picks up the bill in that instance.  Why should we victimise elderly people and insist that they must pay for their care, and if they cannot pay for it, insist that payment come from the sale of their homes?  Not only must people sell their homes, but they must sell those assets at 15% of their value when they went into the home.  People spend three and a half years, on average, in nursing homes.  When a house is sold in line with this measure, 15% of its end value will be much more than 15% of its value when they went in.  When this Bill was introduced, house prices were much higher than they are now.  As this measure is fundamentally wrong and unjust, we must decide how to deal with it.  I suggest that we should revisit the 2002 Mercer report on the care of the elderly, which included a number of recommendations.  We should consider the introduction of an insurance scheme, for example, whereby a specific contribution is made as people age.  That money should be ring-fenced and ultimately used to meet the cost of future care.  As people go through their working lives, every single individual, rich or poor, should know that if and when he or she gets sick and needs to go into a home, all of us will share his or her pain.  In such circumstances, everyone should make a contribution to the cost.Nobody should have to sell his or her home.  That is a fundamental and important aspect of this issue.  People value their homes more than anything else.  As we know, the Government is introducing legislation to try to ensure the banks will allow people to stay in their homes when they cannot afford to pay their mortgages.  Everybody recognises the need for social justice in this regard.  A deeper form of justice is at play when it comes to making sure that those who happen to end up in nursing homes do not have to sell their homes and bear the cost of it.  I urge the Government to think again about this aspect of the legislation, which is fundamentally flawed.  The proposed system is totally unacceptable to me.Approximately two thirds of people in nursing homes are in high dependency categories.  They may not be able to get out of bed, for example.  Many of those who have Alzheimer's disease cannot speak or walk.  In many cases, people in nursing homes have no means of expressing what is happening to them.  They are extremely vulnerable.  The HSE website provides evidence that time and time again, private nursing homes are unable to care for such people.  They do not have enough staff on duty, particularly at night, to look after them.I would like to refer to a HSE evaluation of 25 of the 26 complaints that were made about nursing homes in the Cork-Kerry region in 2007.  The complaints related to non-accidental injuries, including trips, falls, fractures and bruising; dehydration; problems relating to pressure sores and wound care; lack of attention to residents' personal hygiene; poor standards of hygiene; inadequate care; an assault by a resident on another resident; absconding or leaving a nursing home; staffing levels; rough handling of residents; issues relating to contracts of care, including finances; poor communication between those in charge of nursing homes and families; and failure to summon medical care or to seek medical opinion.  One of the evaluation's recurring themes is the care of residents with dementia or mental health problems.I would like to mention some incidents in a specific nursing home in Cork.  They are by no means unusual in Cork or anywhere else in the country, sadly.  A patient with dementia suffered a fracture while in bed.  Another patient, who had high levels of dependency, was allowed to rest on a broken bed.  No explanation was given for the discharge of a patient, following respite care, who had an infected leg wound.  In other cases, individual patients at the home were found to have an infestation of head lice, an untreated leg wound, to be suffering from dehydration, to have new and discoloured pressure ulcers and bruising on the body, to have a swollen and bruised right foot, to have scratches on the genitalia and a tear on the perineal area.  A patient aged 94 with poor hygiene was admitted to Cork University Hospital.  Cases were reported of rooms not being cleaned for new patients, soiled sheets being discovered and confused patients being allowed to enter rooms and rummage through other patients' clothes.  Bells were not answered at night.  In cases of falls, family members were sometimes expected to take patients to the local accident and emergency department.  It was found that some clinical procedures at the nursing home were carried out in a rough manner or without the permission of the relevant families.  That is a sample of what is going on.I invite the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, to take the time to visit the website to get evidence of what is happening in many nursing homes.  I wish to make it clear, in the interests of fairness and objectiveness, that a significant number of nursing homes provide an excellent and first-class service.  However, an equally significant number of nursing homes are bad and some of them are absolutely appalling.  If one was depending for one's evidence on the facts in the Leas Cross documentation that I obtained under the Freedom of Information Acts, one would not think there was anything wrong with the place at all.  There was just one hint of a problem at the home.  Many other nursing homes are just as bad as Leas Cross, if not worse.  Despite what those on the other side of the House might say, nothing has changed.  In my view, things have got worse.  The only good thing that has happened is that the HSE is providing for out-of-hours inspections in some cases.  Inspectors discovered some appalling things in a nursing home in County Cavan at 4.30 a.m.The law has not changed.  One of the key points I would like to make is that the law should impose a statutory duty and obligation on people, particularly those who work in nursing homes, who have evidence of elder abuse.  They should be obliged to report such evidence to the relevant authorities.  There is no such obligation at present.  It should be a criminal offence for them not to report what they know to the HSE or the competent authorities.  The problem at the moment is that we do not know about these things because they are not being reported.The HSE's lack of accountability also needs to be considered.  The HSE has a statutory duty of care to ensure that every nursing home in the State is inspected at least twice per annum.  In previous years, I used to get those details when I tabled a parliamentary question on the matter to the Minister.  Last year, however, the HSE responded by saying that it did not keep the information I was seeking, or that it did not have time to give it.  In other words, it could not care less.  It is appalling that there is such a lack of accountability or concern at administrative level within the HSE.I have made a complaint to the Irish Human Rights Commission about the abuse of people's human rights that is taking place in nursing home care institutions.  I received an answer from the commission today.  I was sent a letter to the effect that a member of staff from the commission had spoken to the senior inspector of nursing homes within the Health Information and Quality Authority, whose name I do not immediately have to hand.  As I understand it, the senior inspector informed the commission that the Minister for Health and Children has not yet signed the order to allow the authority to inspect private and public nursing homes.  That is a disgrace.  It was supposed to be signed in January, but it has not happened yet.  I urge the Minister to sign it immediately.  I have faith in the totally independent inspectorate that the Health Information and Quality Authority will put in place.  The inspectorate does not have any statutory powers at the moment.  It is not acceptable that we are continuing to rely on the structures that have been in place over recent years.I would like to speak about the merits of public and private nursing homes in the context of a contribution made earlier by a Deputy, whose comments I respect.  The Deputy in question suggested that the State now takes a neutral stance on the question of whether people should opt for public or private care.  In other words, if somebody has to go into a nursing home, the State does not mind whether he or she goes to a State institution or to a private institution.  That is unacceptable.  It is an abrogation of the State's responsibility and accountability when it comes to the care of senior citizens.  It is part of the ongoing policy of the Minister, Deputy Harney, to privatise the health services.  There is absolutely convincing international evidence to suggest that private nursing home care is not as good as State nursing home care.  The best care of all is not-for-profit care.There is a way around all of this.  The State has encouraged builders, etc., to invest in nursing homes.  When such people build the infrastructure for a nursing home, they do not have the capacity to run it.  That is what happened in the case of Leas Cross.  The State needs to continue to encourage people to invest in the physical buildings, but it should run them.  In the absence of the State, voluntary not-for-profit organisations should be encouraged to get involved.  They should provide services in buildings that have been developed by others.  While each nursing home would have to be run as a business, obviously, the money that would be made should be reinvested in the home's patients and clients.  If there is a problem with the person who made the investment, he or she should be entitled to get an income from the home.The present system, which has failed miserably and appallingly, is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister of State, in her speech at the conclusion of this debate, whenever that is, to give the House a commitment that the final report from the Leas Cross inquiry will be debated in this Chamber.  As the report has now been delayed by six months, I am sure it will include many recommendations, all of which should be brought into effect.  That is critically important.Other issues pertaining to nursing home care have been brought to my attention.  One such issue is that the economic and social status of siblings living together, as many do throughout the country, is not recognised under the Bill.  They are not classed as couples and are, therefore, charged individually, which may leave the sibling in the home particularly worse off.  He or she cannot apply for financial hardship due to the conditions requiring him or her to be made part of a couple.  That issue must be addressed.Those involved in the care of the aged in our community have brought a number of other issues to my attention.  A key point is whether people will be better off under this Bill than they were heretofore.  The case has been made that the quality of care is not improving and I accept that is the factual position.  The majority of clients who will be cared for in nursing homes under the provisions of this Bill will have high levels of dependency.  A key point is that nursing homes do not have sufficient staff with the necessary qualifications to care for these people.  Nursing home staff will not have the capacity to look after these very ill patients and the necessary facilities will not be in place.  A key issue in the case of Leas Cross Nursing Home was that, while it was evident from television coverage or if one walked around it that it was a state-of- the-art building, patients with high levels of dependency who resided there were not properly looked after.There is evidence that some people in the State system are being abused, namely, some people in some State-run or in HSE nursing homes.  Cases of such abuse in Donegal have been brought to the attention of the Minister of State.  A case is under investigation in an institution in Roscrea.  I have not been able to obtain any further facts on it.  Perhaps the Minister of State can advise what happened in that case, as the HSE was not in a position to advise me, other than to indicate that a serious investigation was carried out there.  I would like to know its outcome.The response I received from the HSE in one area was shameful and disgraceful.  I inquired as to the reason a facility in Dundalk was not taking in any more respite patients during the summer.  Under a freedom of information inquiry, I discovered the reason for this.  It transpired that approximately a year ago when some agency nurses in a unit did not turn up for work and no nursing staff were available to look after the patients, domestic staff took on nursing duties.  That happened over a period of time and it is well documented.  The HSE decided it could not allow that situation to continue.  It decided that it would not take in any more respite patients in order to reduce the exposure of patients to a lack of care arising as a result of agency nurses not turning up for work.I was shocked to read about that.  While I appreciate that the staff there tried to help out, they were not qualified or able to do the work.  I submitted a question to HSE areas throughout the country seeking information on whether there is evidence of such practice occurring elsewhere and I have yet to receive a response from some.  The HSE in Cork kindly replied to the effect that the processing of my freedom of information request would cost €50,000.  That represents an obstruction in my trying to ascertain the facts.  The Minister of State has responsibility for this area.  I ask that she take up this issue with the HSE and inquire what other evidence, if any, there is of agency nurses not turning up for work resulting in patients, in some cases, in State institutions not being looked after properly.  If domestic cleaning and caring staff are doing the work of nursing staff, that is not acceptable.The situation is serious.  The Government has not acted adequately or properly in this respect.  If this Bill is enacted, I would be particularly concerned about provision for those people who may not have any income, other than their State pension, of whom there are thousands.  I refer to people, in the main, currently in our State institutions.  They are there mainly because their only income is their State pension, they do not have private insurance and cannot afford to go into a nursing home.The sale of such a person's home, the only asset he or she has, will impact heavily on that person's family.  Mary Murphy or Johnny Maguire, on going into a nursing home, will be told she or he will have to sell her or his home.  That may be the only asset that person has to hand on to his or her family or relatives.  It is a measure of the lack of respect we have for these people, if we do not say that should not happen.  We would not ask such a person to sell his or her home if his or her child was sick in hospital.  Neither would we ask such a person to do so to pay for his or her care if he or she was under the age of 65 and had been in hospital for a long time.  However, once a person goes into State care or nursing home care, that person is told he or she must sell his or her home.  There is a basic inhumanity in that process.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on those issues.Under this legislation, the Minister of State is delivering these people into the hands of a negotiating team, the National Treatment Purchase Fund, who will negotiate with the nursing home owners the price of care.  My evidence is that nursing home costs are increasing.  People cannot afford to pay such costs.  The HSE is not increasing subventions.  Will the basic cost of care include cost of physiotherapy, speech therapy, patients' laundry, all those services the provision of which involves extra costs under the current system?  Whatever amount the Minister will fix and whatever cost is negotiated, it will not be sufficient because the nursing homes will seek more and more money.  My basic point is that they cannot provide adequate and proper care.  Poor helpless people will find themselves in a worse situation than they are in at present.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I welcome the Bill before the House. It has been a long time coming. We know that rushed legislation often is poor legislation.  The patience in bringing forward this detailed Bill hopefully will result in a good Bill that is in the best interests of people who need to access nursing home care.We all know that an issue such as the provision of care for the elderly is an emotive and important one.  I have met many families in my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny who were desperately trying to support a loved one in a nursing home, perhaps struggling to cover the cost of case with a subvention or the lack of it, paupering themselves in many instances to ensure that a much loved relative could have comfort and care at the end of his or her days.  This Bill addresses that worry.  I have no doubt there was a temptation to bring forward this Bill at an earlier stage so that the Government could provide the country with a new framework for nursing home care, but I believe this legislation will make sound investment for the future and remove much of the worry experienced by the families to whom I have spoken.Having a relative in a nursing home is a tremendous wrench for a family, the move often deeply upsetting, the feelings of guilt uppermost in people's minds, even though we know with our minds, if not our hearts, that care is needed.  That, added to the financial worry, results in a family being deeply stressed at such a time.We knew that we had to have a new framework for care for the elderly in Ireland.  It was much needed.  With an aging population the demand for nursing home spaces has increased immensely, as has the provision of care.  Currently, as the Ceann Comhairle probably knows, there are more than 18,000 private beds and approximately 9,000 public beds in the country, but huge regional disparities underlie these figures.  Big shortages are to be found on the east coast and in other parts of the country such as in the north east and even with State subvention, beds are often 50% more expensive than the nursing home spaces, many of which are in the south west.The current framework of nursing home subvention had to be replaced.  The State is currently subsidising much of private nursing home care — 50% of private nursing home funding comes from the nursing home subvention scheme — caused in part by insufficient public nursing home beds.  The regulatory impact analysis for this Bill stated that under the current system an individual who gets a public long-term care bed may be charged a maximum of up to 80% of the non-contributory pension; while every resident in public care has to pay the charges, which are capped regardless of means.  The person availing of long-term private care, however, is subject to a rigorous means test.  Some may be deemed ineligible for subvention, hence the anomalies in care to date.  Problems also arise in our hospitals because of this framework.  Many patients are kept in hospitals longer than necessary because there is a shortage of beds in nursing homes.  This gave rise to that awful term, "bed-blockers", an obscene and degrading term which should not have been coined in the first place.The new scheme, as outlined in this Bill, will provide for an accessible and far more equitable system.  At the outset, professionals from the HSE will be required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of people's care needs.  This is vital if we are to ensure that care is targeted, appropriate and given to those who really need long-term residential care.The principles underlying the financial assessment of people, and the State funding of care, as contained in this Bill, are that co-payment is calculated in accordance with ability to pay; that no one will pay more than the cost of care; that an initial amount of income will be disregarded; and that there will be capping of charge on people's principal private residence.  These are all sound and will give us better care for our elderly.  The principle that the State will guarantee the costs of nursing home care over and above 80% of a person's assessable income is something we can support.The present inequitable and unsustainable system is addressed by the Nursing Home Support Scheme Bill.  Long-term residents in nursing homes, who are on similar incomes, are unlikely to end up paying vastly different care costs as a result of this Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important legislation which has been awaited for some time.  It was known originally as the "Fair Deal Bill" and is now known as the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Bill 2008.  Why was there a change of name?  One must ask many questions about the nature of this Bill.Deputy White spoke about the difficulty in getting patients moved from hospitals to nursing homes and that, as a result, individuals are being called "bed-blockers".  This is an awful name and is completely unfair.  Very often, such people are not able to move because of the difficulty with the present subvention system.  It is possible that I know more about that than anybody else in the country because of the situation in Cavan-Monaghan.  I say that without fear of contradiction because during the last election I talked to both my party leader and to the then leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, about the situation in other constituencies to which they travelled.  There did not appear to be the same pressure in other areas as there was in my immediate area.  I have further proof of that because when people moved out of my immediate area, while remaining the responsibility of the Cavan-Monaghan grouping, nursing homes in Sligo could not believe the greater difficulty they had in dealing with the assessment office in Cavan.  This was no fault of the people there who were just doing what they could with the money available to them.  However, it was a different situation.  I was glad the Minister of State referred to this in her speech.  She admitted there was inconsistency between different areas.  This is completely wrong and must be rectified.  I hope the situation will be different.However, after a cursory glance at this Bill, one must question how it might be.  The initial budget for the fair deal Bill was €110 million but only approximately €50 million is to be allowed for this year.  I imagine it was expected the Bill would take a long time to go through the system and that the money might not be needed.  A ceiling will be put upon it and, if that is to be the case, we will return to a situation where somebody decides who will get a nursing home bed and who will not.  That is a major worry to me.Assessment is another issue that worries me.  Assessment will be made by individuals in the health services and I have a serious anxiety about that.  Assessments are made concerning home help that raise major questions.  Who decides who will get two or four hours, or one hour, per week?I will mention another issue in passing before giving more detail.  I refer to the different groups that are allowed to benefit from the Bill.  Section 4 defines a couple, for the purpose of the scheme, as a married couple, a heterosexual or a same sex couple, who have been co-habiting as husband and wife for at least three years.  As somebody who lives in a rural area where there are a few other people like me who never married, I know several situations where there are brothers, or brothers and sisters, or sisters living together, perhaps for 30, 70 or 80 years, rather than for a mere three years.  However, they are not entitled to be treated in the same way as those heterosexual couples and others mentioned in the Minister of State's speech.  Same sex couples will get preference over family members who live together.  There are all sorts of implications in this.  There could be a situation where somebody retires early to look after a loved one.  However, because that person is not the dependant of the loved one, he or she will not be treated in the same manner as same sex couples.  That is a major issue.There has been much talk over a long period in this House concerning legislation for the inspection of nursing homes and the need for independent inspection.  That must be equal across all nursing homes, whether private or public.  The majority of nursing homes I deal with are good and of high quality, for example, St. Mary's Nursing Home in Castleblayney.  That home is absolutely brilliant.  There are other private nursing homes that are of an equal standard, and almost as good as St. Mary's.  However, when we come across other situations, and the subsequent investigations into those situations, we must raise major questions.  I have an e-mail from a daughter about a loved one.  This person did not die in the nursing home in question because friends of the family got her moved to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda where she subsequently died.  An inquiry was held but, although names, addresses and telephone numbers were supplied of people who had attended that nursing home and seen what had happened, they were never contacted.  What sort of inquiry was that?  It was totally unrealistic and irrelevant and gave only the account of the staff in the nursing home.  It is a home which I normally have much time for because it usually does good work.  A situation such as the one to which I refer is unacceptable and raises many questions about how investigations are carried out.The Bill, and the length of time it has taken to get through the House are causes of much worry.  People have been expecting it for a long time.  A family approached me about 18 months ago.   They had literature from a farming organisation of which I am a member, the IFA, stating that this great Bill would sort out everything.  They had two loved ones going into a high dependency ward in a nursing home at significant cost to them.  They thought this Bill would sort out everything.  Although, thankfully, matters sorted themselves out reasonably well, in that context the situation was untenable and unfair to many people.I am greatly concerned about some details in this Bill.  Making fair what has been unfair and making consistent what has been haphazard is not good enough if it does not solve the problem completely.  The capping of the money is very serious.  This is a needs-led situation and nobody can tell how many people will need this type of support on any given day.  The capping of the money is not on and must be examined.  We can find €7 billion for banks that run riot, whereas only €50 million is allowed for the remainder of this year.  How much will be allowed for next year?  We have to live and see.  Will the Bill operate on the basis that a finite sum is available?  Will high dependency define up to the point of the ability of the State to pay?  There will be differences in the ideas of HSE staff who will decide who will get a bed and when.  That is unacceptable.Nursing homes have different costs.  While an ordinary dependency person can get a nursing home at €800, somebody who needs a high-dependency unit, for example an Alzheimer's disease patient, could pay up to €1,000 or €1,100, even in my home area.  Will that be allowed for under this Bill?  It is equally important.  Many people in very poor circumstances are being asked to pay the difference between what a nursing home cost in 2007 and what it costs today, and they cannot afford it.  It is putting tremendous pressure on them.  I know an elderly person on an old age pension who lives just outside Monaghan town who is being asked to pay the difference out of his social welfare yet is expected to keep a car on the road to travel to and from that nursing home daily.  This is unjust and I hope this Bill will rectify such situations, but I am not sure because the devil is in the detail.The other issue about which I am worried is property, specifically farm holdings.  A farmer may live a normal length of life and decide to hand over the farm holding to the son or daughter.  If the holding is out of that person's name for five years it is no longer taken into account.  On my way up the road this morning I was told of a situation where a young man's father dropped dead suddenly a couple of years ago.  The man's mother had been in a bad accident 15 years ago, and while the father could cope, the family could not and she is in a nursing home at a very early age.  I will not quote her age because I do not want to embarrass any family.  As the property was transferred less than five years before the father's death, there are all sorts of complications.  This Bill does not clarify how that family will cope.  I hope through the detailed study of the Bill afterwards situations such as that can be clarified.  Not everything is clear cut and goes the way the clerks expect it to, and that is just another example of serious difficulty.I was glad that in the budget the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, referred to the tax benefit for anybody staying at home and that is some relief.  Some might argue that one house might be worth €1 million while another house is worth only €100,000; that is not fair.  However I am much more concerned about the property issue.  If a person is unfortunate enough to go into a nursing home at an early age as a result of disease or a stroke, the 5% comes off for every year that person is in a nursing home.  This is very unfair and could create major problems.  Taking a farming situation, if that went on for seven years it would take 35% of a farm holding.  No son or daughter could raise that sort of money.If the bank gets to know that the loved one who holds a title is in a nursing home, will it lend money to the young person running that property, shop or whatever other business?  Some of these matters may be constitutional and raise questions.   I appreciate that the Bill went through a long gestation period because of many of these issues, but there is still much concern.  A few months ago one of my colleagues mentioned in a speech that he was worried about shares.  Shares are not a major problem now, especially if they are in banks.I want to return to the medical assessment, a serious issue about which I am very concerned. A person living alone in an isolated area may want to go into a nursing home earlier than somebody in a family situation with plenty of support and help.  Will those circumstances be taken into account as part of the assessment?  If not, we have a major problem.  These issues must be clarified.  Another issue was brought to my attention in recent days, that of somebody who has recently returned home from the US, the UK or anywhere else.  Deputy Connaughton has dealt more than anybody else with the people who went away years ago, had to come home or wanted to come home and may not have any family.  What is their situation?  Will they be treated in the same way as a non-national who has been in this country only a few years?  Will the fact that they were born and reared in this country and their wish to come home be taken into account?  The person about whom I am talking, whom I met in the past few days, had two brothers in the US, both of whom are deceased.  None of the three married and they have no families, yet all his family circle are in the region to which he has returned.  He does not want a nursing home now, but if he wants one in the future what will be his situation?  He would still carry the pension from the US, the UK or wherever he worked, but alone it would be insufficient and he is unlikely to have any property.  That is an interesting question.  There is another issue.  If any person, including the Minister of State, has a second home here — I am not sure whether the Minister of State does or not — it is taken into account, but if a person has a home outside this country it is not taken into account.  This is a strange situation and one over which there are major question marks.  I hope I am wrong.  Am I?

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	235	That is important, because it did not seem clear in the Bill.  I hope it is definite, because it would be totally wrong if that were not the case.At the start of this debate the Minister stated:We are making fair what has been unfair.  We are making consistent what has been haphazard.  We are making sure what has been in doubt.  What has been unsettling will be reassuring.  What has been unclear will be clear.  What has been unpredictable will be predictable.I wish I could get that same certainty from this Bill.  I say this with all due respect, and I will come back to the points with which I started.  There is a problem if there is a ceiling on the money concerned.  That is not possible.  There are many other schemes in this country which have no ceiling.  How can the Minister put a ceiling on what is available to the elderly?  Those people gave their lives for the State when things were more difficult even than they are today.  My other concern relates to the issue of inspection of homes.  More important, however, is the issue of who will decide who gets into a home.  If there is a limited budget, who decides who will get the money that is available?  That is the most serious issue of all.  Political structures and pressures will be in place which will not be to the overall benefit of the elderly, whom we all want to see cared for.My late mother died in a nursing home.  I appreciate what the Sacred Heart home in Clones did for her.  It was a sudden call because she deteriorated so quickly.  That is the situation that many families are up against.  I genuinely did not believe she would last more than weeks, but she lasted 15 months in the home because of the excellent care she got.  Nobody should decide what the ceiling is and nobody should decide who can get the subvention and who cannot.  It should be available for all who need it.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	238	This Bill marks a significant change in how health care is delivered in Ireland, as it removes the right to free health care enshrined in the Health Act 1970 and singles out a particular sector of society — the elderly — as a group requiring institutional care and paying institutional costs.  No other section of our society will be hit by this Bill.  Children are born in maternity hospitals provided by the State.  When they cut their knees in the schoolyard they go to the emergency unit of a public hospital.  Those of us who do not have private health insurance will live our lives in the public health care sector until we get old.  The Minister has not discriminated between private and public sector by specifying in which sector this care will take place.  Is there a preference as to where the Minister sees this care being delivered?  Or will we see with the roll-out of this scheme something similar to collocated hospitals, with collocated long term nursing beds?If we are to take the fair deal scheme as a good idea, we must admit there is a world of difference between a good idea and good implementation.  This scheme was launched in 2006 with an expectation that it would be in place on 1 January 2008.  After two years in the making, it was not launched.  Deputy White stated earlier that the Government needed to take its time thinking it over.  There were two years to think it over.  In the absence of thinking it over, when 1 January 2008 came there was no contingency plan.  Nothing was in place for subvention that year, and chaos was created.  People were left in limbo.In 2008, Age Action Ireland pointed out that €110 million was set aside for the roll-out of this programme, and €85 million returned as savings to the HSE during that time.  There are approximately 30,000 people in long-term care at this time, whether in the public or the private sector, and the cost of the delay for the extended families of those people ran into thousands upon thousands of euro.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, when speaking about the fair deal scheme in one interview, mentioned a cost of €40,000, which is €6,000 more than the average industrial wage, to keep a person in care because of the failure to implement the scheme, which was on the shelf for two years.One could make a study of the Government's version of chaos theory.  The principle underpinning this theory is that one creates so much chaos that people will accept anything.  There has been so much chaos out there, and people have been paying so much, that they will accept any deal except what they have at the moment.  They cannot get subvention as it is not available or it is capped at whatever it was before 2008.  In the absence of this legislation, they are being bled on a week-to-week basis of massive sums of money.  I will give just one example of a case I dealt with in my own constituency of Cork South-Central.  The family of an elderly woman was paying her nursing home fees, which were recently increased by €50 per week to more than €2,600 per month.  At the same time the subvention from the HSE towards the woman's nursing home costs was dramatically cut, leaving her family to shoulder costs of more than €400 per week.  This happened in June of last year.  At first she was receiving a weekly subvention of €472.70, but when her house was taken into consideration these payments were reduced to €182 per week, leaving the family to shoulder the remaining charges of €400 per week.  There is a great deal of nonsense in this.  How, in the name of God, could the HSE give a notional value for an income based on the value of a house when the fair deal scheme was not even in place?  I cannot get my head around it.  How was this elderly women concluded to be earning an income from this property when the fair deal scheme was not in place, she had family still living in the house and it was generating no income?  The calculations do not add up.The numbers in nursing homes and nursing costs will increase.  Deputy O'Dowd referred to the current number of 30,000 people in nursing homes.  That number will rise significantly in forthcoming decades.  The reason this will happen is that the demography of the Irish population has changed significantly.  When I was a child, and I am not that old, there were six to eight children in the average household on Connolly Road, Ballyphehane.  That was an extended family that could provide care for their parents when they got elderly.  Thankfully, in my case my parents live at home.  However, we have now moved to a position where the normal size of a family in this country is two children.  The extended family support, and one should bear in mind the age profile of the people currently in nursing home care, will not be available in the future.  That support cannot be sustained in the way it has been to date with smaller family sizes.One issue that has arisen, between the cock-up on the subvention scheme and the two year delay, is the overall sum of money that is to be calculated.  I do not believe this issue has been raised in any of the earlier debates.  Property values have dropped significantly in the past 12 months.  A 15% calculation has been made to pay for these costs.  Given that the value of property is to drop further in the next three or four years according to all expert opinion, there will be a falling income under the fair deal scheme for the system as it is currently presented.  In fact, it would make sense for somebody to opt into the fair deal scheme in the next year and a half when property values are at their lowest.  Will the Minister clarify when the property value is set?  Is it at the time the contract is signed, the time of the person's death or at some point between the two?  After all, the value of property in Cork South-Central two years ago is quite different from its current value.  This matter must be clarified.I wish to mention a situation, one of many, I have encountered in my constituency.  Every Member of this House has heard their constituents discussing this situation.  Where an elderly person bequeaths a house to a child, who subsequently marries, but the elderly person retains a proportion of the house — perhaps one third and the husband and wife would have two thirds, how will that be calculated in the future?How will the nursing home beds be provided?  Does the Government envisage the State being the main provider of the beds or will it be the private sector, where costs and standards may vary from one location to another?  Another critical point is that if the calculation will be based on a falling property market, I cannot see how daily costs will be met.  I would be grateful if the Minister would respond on these issues.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13215	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Will the Minister tell us whether it is envisaged that the Health Act 1970, which guaranteed the right to a bed, will be revoked and whether that right will be enshrined in the new legislation?  If that right is not to be revoked and in the event of somebody deciding not to sign up to and be a willing stakeholder in this scheme but it is decided medically that the person requires a bed, will he or she have an automatic right to a bed in a public or private facility?On the resourcing of the scheme, if somebody goes into a private facility, will the charges accruing for the provision of that bed be capped by the State?  Will the State legislate for or regulate the charges of nursing homes for the provision of that bed?  I can envisage a situation where the private sphere, because of the economies of scale in that sector and the dramatic reduction in the provision of public beds for elderly people, will see an opportunity, when the budget is outlined each year in the annual Estimates passed by this House, to get together, pool their resources and calculate what the charging regime could be for a bed.  That will present untold problems for many families.  Can the Minister comment specifically on this issue?If a person has a property and a son or daughter has been bequeathed that property or if a son or daughter who is not married has been given that property legally and if there is a legal arrangement whereby the person has an automatic right to residence in the home, what is the legal provision in the event of that person going into a nursing home?  The regime at present is such that even though the son or daughter is residing within the family home and there is a legal arrangement to that effect, there is still a calculation of 15% rental income in arriving at the nursing home subvention.  That is unfair.  I consider it so unfair that I have referred the specific case to the Ombudsman, as an independent source, to ascertain her determination on such a provision.  What will the legal provision be in the new arrangement, after the legislation is passed?We are shoring up many problems but in seeking to deal with one set of problems the House and the Government will create a new set.  I still cannot get my head around the proposals in the legislation regarding ancillary State support.  I refer Members to the Citizens Information Board which produced a paper in December 2008 that referred specifically to ancillary State support in the context of this Bill.  The paper says the Bill distinguishes between State support and ancillary State support.  We are aware of the provisions relating to State support but, according to the paper one must apply separately for ancillary State support; one can apply even if one does not qualify for State support; ancillary State support can be based on relevant assets only, not cash assets; and there must be a property over which a charge can be taken.If somebody applies for ancillary State support, a charge is levelled against the property.  What is the repayment schedule on that?  If I need to go to a nursing home tomorrow, for example, and I apply for ancillary State support, what agency will pay the money to the nursing home in terms of the support that is given?  Will it be the HSE or another such agency as determined by the Minister for Health and Children?  If this will be a resource-based scheme and if we are now living in times of economic turmoil, I can see a situation where there will be hundreds of people queuing up for nursing home beds who will not be able to get one as they will not be able to benefit from the ancillary State support because there will not be such funding.  How that will work its way out through the system needs to be teased out.We are reaching a stage in this country where the community beds that once provided wonderful nursing home care are being whittled away by a process of stealth.  We are moving so far into the private sector that by the time it comes for me to be cared for in a nursing home, the costs accruing will be so astronomical it will place such a burden on the State as to be untenable.  At this stage of the process I would put forward a theory that there needs to be a greater degree of analysis about how we can provide beds within the public sector.  For example, there is a 42-bed facility in north Cork which is about to be closed.  It is neither a geriatric nor a psychiatric unit; it has no designation.  It is a wonderful facility in a wonderful setting.  If, instead of being closed, it received the right amount of investment, it could provide a wonderful facility for the provision of care for the elderly within its catchment area as a community facility.  Those same people would happily pay their pension or a proportion of the cost of getting their bed within that facility and they would gladly welcome whatever subvention or State support that would arise.However, there is no foresight and no planning.  I see nothing in this legislation that would give me any grounds for hope — I must be honest about it — that the Minister will ensure we will move seamlessly from the current regime into a new regime and that this will be a panacea for the elderly.  I can see a situation where the number of people, family members of persons who are in nursing homes, who come to my clinics will increase as a result of this ill thought-out legislation.I heard the Taoiseach describe himself here as an egalitarian republican.  If we are speaking of egalitarianism, older people should be able to come to their autumn or winter years with a certain peace of mind knowing that they or their families will not be left with an undue financial burden when it comes to caring for them.  I cannot see anything in this legislation that will give solace to those people.I reiterate the point that if we are to have a proper system in this country, it must be with the proviso that the cost of care in nursing homes must be capped.  Deputy O'Dowd made the point earlier.  There is the bare cost of provision for the bed for the week but there are also the extra costs that now seem to be accruing, which are not accounted for.  I refer to chiropody, hairdressing and other such services which seem to be added on week in, week out.I am not against the private sector because I visit nursing homes on a regular basis and I see the good work that is being done there, but there must be a good mix.  This comes back to the point I made about the 1970 Act.  I am asking that the 1970 Act not be rescinded and that everybody would have a right to a bed, whether in the public or private sector.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I am delighted to get this long awaited opportunity to speak on this Bill in which I have a great interest.I suppose all one could say at the outset is that this legislation is like the curate's egg in that it is good in spots, but I have serious reservations about part of it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, and her senior Minister are selling this as being accessible, affordable and anxiety free.  It is all three for a certain category of person.  It is surely that for someone who does not own a house, who has less then €36,000 in personal belongings and who owns no land.  By and large, the person to whom I refer has no means other than his or her old age pension.  I must admit it is a good scheme for such a person.If one scrutinises the next category, then the scheme becomes extraordinarily involved and difficult.  I do not want to see legislation going through the House that will have the effect of splitting up families.  The Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, comes from a rural constituency, as I do.  I do not want to see the slightest possibility of a family having a row about an asset they thought was theirs until the State gets its hands on it and proves that it was not.  I will try to explain what I mean.No doubt the system had to be changed.  There was terrible trouble about the inconsistencies in and the unfairness of the subventions as applied right across the country.  Those, like me, who came from the old Western Health Board area felt that others were getting a much higher subvention than we could get.  This scheme treats public and private patients equally and from that point of view, it is to be welcomed.The old scheme had to be changed.  One aspect I noted — on this issue I have considerable experience, as much as anybody else in this House — is that in so far as keeping elderly people in a nursing home was concerned we had reached a point where there were only two or three fundamental points to be addressed.  Deputy Hoctor will know this better than most.  We are speaking about people who had the maximum old age contributory or non-contributory pension.  That is what they had in their hand every Friday, approximately €200.  In our case the subvention was €300 making a total of €500 under most conditions.  That was all right when the bed in the nursing home was €550 or €600.  If they had relatives or family members, they might be able to come up with the balance.  Over the past couple of years, however, as the House will be aware, we found that the figure of €600 rose to €700 and €800, and by and large there was no such increase in the pension or the subvention.  The wedge that then came in between was so great that many families just could not afford it.  That was a real issue, as the Minister of State well knows from all the representations I am sure have been made to her and to all Members.  Obviously, there was a need to change that.The new scheme will work well for certain categories of people but the Government is creating havoc with regard to people who own property.  I want to bring the Minister of State back for a moment to these deferred contributions.  I hope I have scrutinised the Bill fairly well.  We hope that every person in the country is entitled to his or her own home.  That is a concept in which I always believed.  That is enormously important in everybody's life, especially as people grow older.  What is happening is that there is a 5% surcharge for the first three years, but it is all dependent on how the sums are calculated.  The Minister of State is saying, in effect, that the maximum will be three years on the house, even if the person is in a nursing home for ten.  However, that does not seem to apply to other assets, such as land.  The rural constituency I represent is very similar to the Minister of State's.  There have been multiple cases of people who own a house and, perhaps, 40 acres of land.  The family might be gone, in the professions and so on and perhaps it might not have suited them to come back, so the land was never transferred, for whatever reason.  In the back of their minds, however, the elderly folk would have somebody in mind to continue the family name, which is enormously important in rural Ireland.However, 40 acres at the moment, even at the depressed values of €10,000 an acre are worth €400,000.  The holding would have been worth a good deal more a few years ago, but that is today's value, with the average price per acre at around €8,000 to €10,000.  A person might be charged €800 a week in a nursing home, which is not exorbitant.  Even bottom league prices, so to speak, are coming close to this and as many colleagues have said, some have gone way over that.  In the event, that works out at €40,000 per annum, and if the person spends ten years in the nursing home, it is €400,000, equivalent to the value of the land at today's prices.  In other words if the patient remains in the establishment for ten years, there is no land left.  The Government has said the patient will only be charged for the cost of the care, or €800 a week.  However, it ultimately means that there is no land left to be transferred to anyone else.  I do not know whether that was what the Government had intended, but it will happen.  There have been several cases of that, already.I want to talk about the house for a minute, the family home.  People talk glibly about the 5% deferred payments on the house.  A house might be worth, say, €75,000.  Until recently one could get nothing for €75,000, although one might, perhaps, be able to buy a small Land Commission-type house for that figure now.  Over the three years, €11,250 will be taken off that.  In other words somebody must come up with that amount.  I shall deal, in a minute, with how it is taken off.Deputy Sherlock mentioned this a few moments ago, and I understand that this will come about by means of the ancillary State support.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners are involved in this.  If one takes the mythical 40-acre farm I was talking about, I assume that at the end of the ten years the State will expect to get its money back.  At that stage the Revenue Commissioners will apply to the Land Registry to say, in effect: "As far as we are concerned the burden of debt is so great on that particular folio that we now own it."  At that point, when the State or the HSE seeks to realise the assets, will the Minister of State say whether the property will be sold on the open market?  The family at that stage will be in no position to come up with the money and according to the legislation, it appears to me that the Revenue Commissioners have an asset on behalf of the State and in order to realise it, I assume the land will be sold.I shall be obliged if the Minister of State will specifically deal with this when replying to the debate.  In the event, I assume that the Revenue Commissioners will sell to the highest bidder.  If land values appreciate to where they were two years ago, will this mean that the estate of the elderly person would benefit by the difference between the sale price and the asset value?  There is a reference to interest being applied, in the legislation.  Will the Minister of State say where that interest is?  Does it mean, in effect, that not alone are we talking about the €10,000 per acre but interest on it every year as well?  What will the interest rate be?  Suddenly one finds that the Revenue Commissioners will be seeking a great deal more money than anyone had anticipated at the beginning.That brings me back to what Deputy Sherlock mentioned.  Will we reach a stage where it will become extremely difficult for the Exchequer to keep on paying?  Remember, there may not be much of an appetite in rural Ireland for some of those sales by public auction.  Some family members, for instance, might object on the grounds that this was where they had been born, not wanting to see the Revenue Commissioners selling the whole place over their heads.  I hope somebody has thought this through because it is a real issue in rural Ireland.  I wanted to have the opportunity to put that before the Dáil this evening.  I hope this has been well thought out but I do not believe it has.I wanted to mention another matter.  As regards the assets, as such, when a person is going into the nursing home, will this involve a legal commitment, and will he or she have access to his or her own solicitor, in the event?  Will each person or family be allowed to have their own legal representative present, beside that of the HSE, and who will pay for the cost of such legal proceedings?  It would be very unfair if only the HSE legal representative was present in processing the deal.  As  the Minister of State knows, it is very important to have a balanced legal approach in matters such as this.  Most parties have solicitors to work on their behalf.In so far as nursing homes are concerned, by and large they are doing an excellent job, and fulfil an enormously important role.  It is not the only role, as we know.  We talk of primary care and helping the elderly to stay in their own homes.  If I live to be 100, I hope I shall die in my own home, not that I have anything against the nursing homes.  We understand that they exist for a particular purpose, but from my viewpoint, I hope to finish up at home, and I believe a great many people think as I do.I was misrepresented here some time ago when talking about the checks on nursing homes, which I entirely agree with.   I pointed out that none of the nursing homes in Galway with which I am familiar was anything other than perfectly run but for some strange reason the news was reported in a slightly different manner.  I have no evidence that any nursing home in Galway with which I am familiar is anything but properly run.  I base that statement on the advice of the relatives of patients in these nursing homes.In so far as this scheme is concerned, the inspectorate will be important.  I hope inspections will take place without advance warning and at any time.  That is important in regard to every person who depends on medical care, whether in nursing homes or hospitals.  I like what I hear in regard to the inspectorate, provided the funding is in place to ensure it is strong enough to act.  It is easy to determine how a nursing home is being run at 3 p.m. but it is another story at 3 a.m.  The people who run great homes will have no problem with inspections but if another Leas Cross exists, it has to be discovered.  A nursing home is no place for an elderly or vulnerable person unless he or she is receiving the best of care and attention.This legislation has had a very long gestation period.  I have seen few other Bills hang around as long as this one.  When it is finally passed and the Minister of State has responded to the issues raised by Deputies on all sides, I hope there will be no more false dawns.  I do not want to hear in six months time that the money has disappeared.  Legislation is no use if a cap is put on its provisions.  Deputies will be aware of the trouble farmers are experiencing in regard to the farm waste management scheme.  If something is promised, the resources should be made available for it even in these difficult times.  Whatever else we do, let us avoid playing around with the elderly because that would not be fair.I do not have time to address the issue of medical eligibility other than to speak about rural bachelors in their late 50s and 60s who have nobody to care for them and may be living a bit rough.  There may be nothing physically wrong with them but they can be lonely and are often unable to access activities.  It would be a disaster if these people are made ineligible for places in nursing homes because where else will they spend the remainder of their lives?  A case could be made for their eligibility on mental health grounds alone.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I am pleased to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.  However, I get a sense from the Bill and its accompanying documents that old people are viewed as a growing problem.  The number of people aged over 65 has increased by 7.3% since 2002 and is expected to increase to more than 800,000 by 2025 and triple by 2050.  Life expectancy is increasing.  I would like to see this Bill put in the context of an overall philosophy of care for older people.The Bill defines "long-term residential care services" as "a facility predominantly for the care of older people, which designation shall specify the health or personal care services to be provided at that facility" but nowhere is the definition of "older people" set out.  Are they over the age of 60, 70 or 80?  The provisions are vague in that regard.  I remind the House that nursing home patients also includes chronically ill young people, many of whom are inappropriately placed.In general, older people want to stay in their own homes for as long as possible.  Home care packages are available but I would like to see an increased provision of sheltered housing and day care facilities.  Nursing homes should be the place of last resort.  People should be provided care in their own homes and day care for as long as possible, followed by sheltered housing.  However, there is a dearth of sheltered housing around the country.  Many people in public and private nursing homes would happily live in sheltered housing if they had the choice.  We need to develop a continuum of care for older people.Clearly, when somebody's health deteriorates to the point at which he or she can no longer continue to live alone, nursing home care has to be provided.  However, an issue arises in regard to a patient's level of incapacity.  Section 7(6) states:A care needs assessment of a person shall comprise an evaluation of—(a) the person’s ability to carry out the activities of daily living, including—(i) the cognitive ability,(ii) the extent of orientation,(iii) the degree of mobility,(iv) the ability to dress unaided,(v) the ability to feed unaided,(vi) the ability to communicate,(vii) the ability to bathe unaided, and(viii) the degree of continence,of the person,These factors require several decisions to be made by multidisciplinary teams.Section 7(11) states:Where a care needs assessment is carried out, this shall not be construed as meaning that the Executive will provide or will arrange for the provision of any service identified in the assessment as being appropriate to meet the needs of the person or that the Executive has an obligation to provide or arrange for the provision of any such service.I am not sure what that provision means.  Is it an opt-out clause?  It suggests that care does not have to be provided even if an assessment points to the need for it.I am aware this is resource capped and I am interested to hear at what point these caps kick in.  Section 10 deals with appeals.  It is important such appeals are carried out by independent people.  As pointed out by other speakers, the Bill provides that the Executive does not have to take into account a valuation provided by a property owner.  I suggest that independent mediation should be provided for in this instance as in others where a dispute arises in respect of a valuation.Section 10(7) refers to requests for information and states that 28 days be provided in that regard, which is a relatively short timeframe.  The section states that the Executive may refuse to further consider an application if such information is not provided.  I believe more flexibility is required and that the section should, perhaps, be reworded as often it can be difficult for a person to obtain the information being sought.More clarification is required in respect of interest on land outside the State.  Many people own property outside the State nowadays.  I do not believe the Bill is clear in terms of how this issue will be dealt with.  This section needs to be tidied up.  The appointment of a care representative is important.  The Bill states such person may be a member of a couple, a parent, child, brother, sister, nephew, niece, aunt or uncle of a relevant person.  Often, elderly people who live on their own are cared for by a cousin or neighbour.  The Minister of State might take another look at this provision.  I know of elderly people, living on their own, who have no such relatives.  I accept a care representative may also be a registered medical practitioner.  However, an elderly person may have a cousin who is close to and good to them.  Perhaps the Minister of State will consider taking into account such a person.I believe there is a typographical error on page 28 wherein it is stated that the court shall not appoint a person to be a care representative unless it has before it a report.  There appears to be something wrong there.  I cannot make sense of it.  The Bill makes reference to the Revenue Commissioners and states that they cannot act after 12 years.  As far as I am aware the Statute of Limitations is six years.  Perhaps the Minister of State will explain the reason for the provision of 12 years in this regard.The Ombudsman is not mentioned in the Bill.  Could the Ombudsman have a role here in the event of a dispute?  I am aware the Health Service Executive comes within the remit of the Ombudsman so it might be useful to include somewhere in the Bill a reference to this.  I did not come across such a reference although I may have missed it.  Perhaps such reference is not necessary as the matter is covered by other legislation.  The Minister of State, when replying, might state on the record whether the Ombudsman can be called upon to adjudicate or give an opinion on some aspects of the Bill if a dispute were to arise.  It is not clear from the Bill whether that is possible although I believe it may be.On ancillary supports and property, elderly people, having sought legal advice, may opt to transfer their property to a son or a daughter when they reach their early sixties, thus taking the gamble that five years will elapse following which the asset, having been transferred, cannot be touched by the State.  Not everybody will have the wherewithal or legal advice to do that.  People who do this may also include in the transfer a clause which provides that they may reside in the house for as long as they live.  It could well happen that many houses belonging to older people will be transferred at an early stage to sons or daughters with a condition attached that they may reside in the house for as long as they want.  However, ownership of the house will then lie with the son or daughter.  Could this type of transfer get around this legislation?  From my reading of it, I think it could.  I am not sure how this issue can be addressed but it is important it is addressed.I was told a number of years ago that construction of nursing homes in Denmark ceased in 1997.  They may have built a great deal of them prior to then.  Going back to my original point, their philosophy is to care for people in their own homes, sheltered housing, day-care and so on for as long as possible.  Also, they have a national rehabilitation service which we do not have.  Often, people here, many of them stroke victims, end up in nursing homes owing to a lack of rehabilitation.  The philosophy on the Continent is that a person first be stabilised in an acute hospital and then moved to a rehabilitation unit.  I have visited some of these units, which are amazing and provide all the services required.  While we have an excellent rehabilitation centre in Dún Laoghaire there is a lengthy waiting list for admission to that facility.  We all know stroke victims go downhill very quickly without early rehabilitation.  I was amazed by the intensity of the service provided at the rehabilitation centre in Denmark and in other parts of Europe.  The philosophy is to assist a patient to be as good as he or she can be and to return him or her, where possible, to the home or sheltered housing.  A person here who suffers a stroke is taken to an acute hospital and usually ends up in a nursing home.  In many cases, there is no need for this.The National Treatment Purchase Fund will be involved in negotiating prices.  I am aware that in some places commissions have been established to set maximum prices to ensure there are sufficient resources to run an operation, that standards are not impacted upon and that investors obtain a reasonable profit.  The setting of prices may be an issue worth examining.  It is important assessments are carried out quickly.  There are two types of assessment involved, namely, the financial assessment and the medical assessment.  It may be possible for a person to arrange for a financial assessment to be undertaken at an early stage.  For example, a family who is aware a person will require nursing home care might require that such an assessment be undertaken, say, six or 12 months earlier.  This would help to speed up the process.  Often, people get ill quickly, a family cannot cope and a delay occurs in getting them into a nursing home.  This is when the real stress builds up.  I say that bearing in mind all of the services we need to put in place, including rehabilitation services etc.We must be careful.  There is a great deal happening in the property market.  There have been massive changes in a short period and the value of property has fallen dramatically.  The current situation is an awful mess.  The system needs to be tightened up and clarified.I look forward to the rest of the debate.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	244	This motion is self-explanatory and much of the rationale behind it is laid out clearly.  While all that remains for me to do is to expand on the motion, I will first address the Government rebuttal, which "welcomes the conviction of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland that the reforms should continue in the Mid-West and elsewhere".  This reference is very selective, however.  In reply, the RCSI president stated, "While supporting this programme, this college remains extremely concerned about the provision of services in the major hospitals where accident and emergency departments continue to be overwhelmed on an ongoing basis and where patients who require elective surgical operations cannot be adequately managed within the health service in a timely and predictable manner".  Clearly, the accident and emergency unit in Limerick falls into this category.Furthermore, the Government rebuttal refers to CT scanners which have been present but not operational in Ennis and Nenagh hospitals for well over a year.  The rest of the rebuttal welcomes and supports various intentions but does not provide timelines, which is at the core of our problem.Yet again, the HSE and the Minister for Health and Children, backed up by a Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government, are ignoring their own report, the Howarth-Teamwork report, Review of Acute Hospital Services in HSE Mid-West.  The report identified a number of issues that had to be addressed in order to achieve their end goal, which is the reconfiguration of the hospitals, with the centralisation of surgery and acute medical services in Limerick Regional Hospital.The first area they examined was the accident and emergency department of Limerick Regional Hospital.  A number of issues arose out of this.  First, they acknowledged the unit needs serious upgrading as it is regularly overcrowded, with as many as 15 to 30 people lying on trolleys for longer than 24 hours and a mean waiting time of somewhere between seven and eight hours for all patients.  Into this cocktail, the Minister will add the patients of north Tipperary and Clare, which will result in further chaos and reduction of services, and is grossly unfair on the people of Clare, north Tipperary and Limerick.Another facet of the accident and emergency unit is the staffing levels, particularly in regard to consultants.  Currently, there are three very hard-working consultants in the accident and emergency department but this number does not allow for a consultant-delivered service so it remains a consultant-led service.  To achieve the former and to achieve best practice, the report recommends that eight consultants in total be employed in accident and emergency.Not one of these additional five consultants has been appointed.  In fact, only two of the five posts have been approved.  Although none of the jobs has been advertised, the word "approved" gives the impression that the posts will be filled imminently but this could not be further from being the case.  There first must be approval of a post, then advertisement, the drawing up a panel, the interviewing of applicants and then, ultimately, the making of an appointment.  It is then necessary to wait for the successful applicant to become available.  The process can take anything up to 18 months.One of the main reasons for the congestion in accident and emergency in Limerick is lack of capacity within the regional hospital.  The Teamwork report recognises this and recommends 135 additional beds prior to the reconfiguration of the service.  Not one of these beds is in place.  Instead, we are given a sop, with talk of reducing the average bed stay from 6.5 to 3.5 days, which will result in additional capacity.  Yet, where is the evidence to support the suggestion this can happen?  In order for this to be achieved, practices have to change within the hospital and the community, and there needs to be much greater support for the patient in the community.  None of this has happened.  I emphasise that none of the recommended 135 beds is in place.Another area of concern in the Teamwork report is the necessity for further ambulances to service north Tipperary and the Clare region, including Ennis.  None of these ambulances is in place.  Furthermore, these ambulances are to be supplemented by emergency medical technicians or paramedics who will be able to give certain drugs at the roadside but will not be able to administer life-saving blood transfusions.  The paramedic will travel in the ambulance with the patient if there is a serious life-threatening condition but with the current proposed spread of paramedics, there would not be somebody to take up the slack or to drive the paramedic's car from the scene of the accident.The bottom line for patients in areas like Carrigaholt and Lorrha in Clare and north Tipperary is that they will be well outside the "golden hour" in terms of accessing the necessary life-saving treatment which has been proven in the past to have a major influence on outcome.  There is a real need to supplement this until the road system is properly finished.  The report referred to a helicopter but I have not heard mention of it since.Another integral part of this plan is for a high-dependency unit of 40 beds to be built at Limerick Regional Hospital.  Again, there is no sign of this.  Planning permission has not even been applied for and from talking to the hospital doctors at Limerick Regional Hospital and St. John's, they feel there is a need for at least another 40 beds to which to transfer those patients.Another area of deep concern relates to the local general practitioners, who were unanimously opposed to this move at a major meeting with the HSE.  Not one GP out of 81 at that meeting was prepared to vote in favour of this plan as currently implemented.  These are the doctors on the ground, in the community, who know the people and the real, practical difficulties they suffer.  They are at one with their community in opposing this, not least because they have been in touch with their colleagues in the north east — in counties Monaghan, Cavan and Louth — where reconfiguration also took place and where a fiasco resulted.  I am told this situation resulted in 17 people passing by Monaghan Hospital in an ambulance only to arrive too late at Cavan.  To quote one of the participants in the recent "Prime Time" programme, a Clare man, "There is no point in having utopia if it is a corpse that arrives".We have been accused of scaremongering but the facts are the facts.  We have seen the extraordinary situation of Drogheda hospital having to close for seven hours because it just could not cope.  We have seen the additional load on accident and emergency units in the region, including Beaumont Hospital, which had up to 50 people on trolleys a few weeks ago.  We have heard one of the accident and emergency consultants talk of a 25% improvement when a patient is brought to a centre of excellence for multiple trauma.  However, these studies relate in the main to helicopter medevac on the roadside to bring the patient to the centre.  First, we do not have the helicopter and, second, will we seriously describe an overcrowded accident and emergency unit at Limerick Regional Hospital as a centre of excellence when it will have to deal with 54,000 more patients per year arriving from Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's hospitals?This is just another instance of putting the cart before the horse.  What really upsets people is that, underlying this, they see a trend — anything that will save money is implemented post haste but anything that will save lives or cost money will be put on the long finger into the distant future.  That has been the history of this Government and this Minister.In the original draft of this report, the cost of implementation was put at €380 million yet we are told there is only approximately €6 million to make it happen.  Further, we have been advised by the Minister that the doctors in the hospital have been all bought into this and are enthusiastically supporting it.  I have met all of those doctors.  The two lead surgeons believe they will get the funding and trust the HSE to deliver but I am afraid nobody else does.  Many of their colleagues are becoming increasingly concerned.  At the outset, they were concerned by the lack of consultation on the Teamwork report but they are becoming more concerned with each passing day given the way it has been implemented and the ongoing lack of consultation.Having taken all of the above into consideration, this comes down to an issue of trust of the people of Ireland, in particular the people of the mid-west, in our current Minister, the Government and their much-discredited agency, the HSE.  We cannot trust a Minister and a Government which told us in January 2007 there would be no cutbacks, when they knew full well there would be.  We cannot trust a Government and Minister which told us cutbacks would not hurt patients, when they clearly did.  We cannot trust the Minister or the Government who promised the wonder of a vaccine against cancer for our children in August 2008 and which, three months later, turned their backs on those same children.The Minister for Health and Children has displayed a pattern of behaviour which is very worrying.  My words may seem harsh, but what else can one say when the Minister received letters from concerned doctors in Portlaoise dating back to 2002, and which were re-addressed to her in 2005, yet she did not take any appropriate actions.  We saw what occurred as a consequence.  There were 11 misdiagnoses of breast cancer.  The files of 97 women were thrown into the corner of an office until a cohort was reached.  That horrible ethos led to the same situation arising in the north east.  In September 2007 the HSE knew a problem existed there and yet took no action until May 2008.  It knew it was possible there were people walking around with lung tumours growing.  In that instance, letters were written to the Minister complaining about the service, the lack of staff and the over-use of locums.  However, nothing was done about it.An article was published in The Sunday Times last weekend by Mr. Paul Gallagher who, through a freedom of information request, discovered that the consultants in Ennis General Hospital also wrote to the Minister highlighting deficiencies in the radiology service and stating it was not safe.  Yet again, nothing was done.  We are all familiar with the consequences in that case, which is now the subject of a HIQA inquiry following much public outcry, including comments from the family concerned.  The Minister eventually agreed to the inquiry.  What is emerging is a recurring pattern that borders on criminal negligence.  There appears to be a refusal to listen to professionals in the field who have put their concerns in writing, a refusal to act in any appropriate fashion, and a refusal to address these issues.Here we are again.  Another report is before us, the thrust and principle of which have much merit, including the principle of centralising facilitates and trying to get the best for patients.  However, the manner in which it is being implemented has no such merit.  Everything this report seeks to do, including to improve safety and to reach goals, is being ignored and put on the long finger.  This is not the way to proceed.  The report does not have the support of the people or the professionals.I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Harney, her Government colleagues, the Deputies who support her, especially the Ministers of State, Deputies Máire Hoctor and Tony Killeen, and Deputies Timmy Dooley and Michael Lowry to step up to the plate, to protect the people of the mid-west and to insist that the full recommendations of the report are implemented.  Only then should the House consider the future of Nenagh General Hospital and Ennis General Hospital.  I commend the motion to the House.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I support the motion and I wish to be associated with the arguments put forward by Deputy Reilly.  The people of the mid-west are very fortunate to have such excellent medical practitioners, including consultants, doctors, nurses and paramedical staff.  The service they provide is tremendous.  I visited Limerick Regional Hospital this morning at 8.30 a.m.  Everyone there went about their business, happily working and setting about the tasks of the day.  They were able to separate their personal traumas, pension levies and family concerns from their day's work.  They were up at work early in the morning and quite cheerful about it.  I held a brief conversation with a consultant.  He remarked on the uncertainty of the times and that the only remaining certainties concerning this Government were death and taxes, which is as good an epithet as one is likely to hear.  I compliment the staff who provide a great service in the hospital in Limerick.  Even if they are reconfigured, they will continue to do so.It is very easy to agree with the objectives of this report.  Who would disagree with a report which is supposed to deliver on improved patient safety?  Who would disagree with maximising clinical outputs, a programme to deliver better value for money, or an objective which purports to provide a high-quality service close to all patients' homes?  It is not the objectives of this report with which one would disagree but its implementation, measured against the past experience of the Minister and the Department of Health and Children.The modus operandi does not meet the needs of the region.  It is planned to centralise emergency services at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick and to transfer to there all trauma cases from Ennis General Hospital, Nenagh General Hospital and St. John’s Hospital.  It is planned to turn these hospitals into minor ailment facilities operating from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  The theory and practice very quickly go their separate ways.  They do so because the facilities are not in place in Limerick regional hospital to take the existing workload and certainly the facilities are not in place to take the workload which would arise from the transfer of cases from Ennis, Nenagh and St. John’s hospitals.The Minister promised that the necessary facilities would be put in place.  However, nobody believes the Minister and with good reason.  The Minister has previously made promises on innumerable occasions concerning different aspects of the health service and its delivery throughout the country.  However, the promises have not been fulfilled.  Deputy Seymour Crawford will again illustrate the difficulties in the north east and Cavan-Monaghan.  We will hear of the litany of pathetic cases, whereby some people we obliged to drive past Monaghan General Hospital to access the services required, but did not arrive on time.  That is the experience of people in the regions when it comes to the integration of services.  It is not a very attractive blueprint for the people of the mid-west who can see what occurred in the north east.In these times of devastating cutbacks, when the pay and conditions of people in the public service are being trashed and when the fiscal situation continues to deteriorate, does anyone believe the Minister will produce €300 million to put the necessary programme in place to facilitate the new workload at Limerick regional hospital?  It is not long ago since, for the sake €8 million, that the Minister reneged on a promise to vaccinate 12 year old girls, so that their lives would be saved at the age of 75 to 80.  The Minister could not deliver on a promise of €8 million.  Does anyone believe it is credible that she will now deliver on a promise to the people of the mid-west, to the people of Ennis and Nenagh, and to the many people in downtown Limerick who use the facilities at St. John's?  Does anyone believe the Minister will deliver?The only relevant figure in the Estimates for 2009 for this programme is a figure of approximately €6 million, but €300 million is required.  I do not understand how this is supposed to add up, which is the problem we face.  The report lists the necessary services, including an emergency operating theatre in Dooradoyle, of which there is no sign, the extension of the ambulance service and the deployment of advanced paramedics in the region.  According to the report this service is under way.  If the ambulances have been ordered, they certainly have not yet been delivered.  The human resources situation involving ambulance drivers is not yet resolved.  They have not even applied for planning permission for a new critical care block in Dooradoyle with ICU, HTU and CCU, although this is an essential component of the reconfiguration.  New facilities in Ennis and Nenagh, a new theatre block in Nenagh, expansion of radiology services in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's, upgrade facilities in Nenagh — these are dreams over the silvermines.  This is not reality.  Nobody believes the Minister will deliver them.  That is the problem she faces with this programme.In debating this issue over the past few weeks, Deputy Reilly has put forward a simple but profound proposition, that the Minister put the new facilities in place before closing the old ones.  If she does that, people will vote with their feet and buy into them straightaway because the facilities outlined here would enhance patient safety and give better clinical outputs.Various case assessments have been made, and an assessment of outputs of patients who went through accident and emergency services in Nenagh and Ennis.  In some cases the outcomes could have been better but there is no guarantee that the outcomes will improve by taking the patients into Limerick in an ambulance, to lie in the accident and emergency unit for five or six hours before receiving attention.There is a sting in the tail of this report because we have highlighted accident and emergency services but, on the first page of the statement I received, the HSE states accident and emergency surgery and critical care services need to be reconfigured as soon as possible, followed by medicine in the longer term.  If one has the patience to read to the end of the report, one can see many plans for the reconfiguration of medical facilities which turn Ennis and Nenagh into medical outposts.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I support the motion proposed by our health spokesman, Deputy Reilly.  The cart is being put before the horse.  The Minister is introducing changes to accident and emergency services on 1 April and to surgical services on 1 July, although the approved services are not available in Limerick Regional Hospital.St. John's Hospital is in my constituency, in the heart of the city.  It is the only accident and emergency service based in the city.  Barrington's was the main provider of accident and emergency services in Limerick until a Fianna Fáil Government closed it in 1988.  St. John's took on that role and has done a terrific job.  The report mentions that the service in St. John's, along with those in Nenagh and Ennis, will be nurse-led.  I welcome the commitment by Mr. Paul Burke, who is co-ordinating the reorganisation of the acute service in the mid-west, that it will continue to be doctor-led.  That is critical for St. John's.  I hope the Minister will give that commitment in writing to Mr. Burke.  There are three doctors in the accident and emergency unit in St. John's, four nurses and two administrators.  I am worried that if the service is doctor-led, the medical skills will be lacking to assess a patient with an acute difficulty.The Teamwork-Howarth report mentions increasing the throughput of patients in the accident and emergency unit of St. John's hospital from 19,000 to 30,000 annually.  St. John's is open five days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.  Does the Minister propose to make that a seven-day a week service?  She proposes sending patients directly to the accident and emergency services in Limerick Regional, where the service is already overstretched.  The average waiting time for a patient in the accident and emergency unit in Limerick Regional is seven to eight hours.  I cannot understand how bringing in extra patients will improve the quality of care.  That is why it is critical that the accident and emergency services are maintained in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's and that the hospitals are upgraded.According to the original Teamwork-Howarth report, €47 million would be spent in St. John's.  That reference has disappeared from the published version of the report.  Will that €47 million investment be honoured?  The hospital needs new buildings and upgrading.  Will the Minister provide the staffing resources to activate the much-needed CT scanner that has sat idle in the hospital for the past two years?  The ground floor of St. John's has been closed for a long time.  It was traditionally closed for the summer months for budgetary reasons but it has remained closed for a longer period.  Does the Minister propose to provide funding to open it?There are excellent medical and consultant staff in St. John's and Limerick Regional and in the hospitals in Nenagh and Ennis.  St. John's and Limerick Regional interact in respect of consultants and appointments.  I would not like to see the elective surgical work that can be carried out in St. John's moved automatically to Limerick Regional.  That would worry medical staff and needs to be clarified.Staff in St. John's say they were not properly consulted in the preparation of the Teamwork-Howarth report.  The consultants visited them for a few hours.  These people are at the coalface and should have been consulted.  Furthermore, they were not consulted before the report was published.  We met many of these people during Deputy Reilly's recent visit to St. John's and Limerick Regional.  It is critical that the HSE engage in meaningful discussions with the staff and management of St. John's.  We want to retain a functioning service and accident and emergency unit.Will the Minister say whether she will give a commitment in writing to providing a doctor-led accident and emergency service in St. John's?  Will she say whether in increasing the throughput of patients from 19,000 to 30,000 patients, the service will increase from five to seven days?  Will she say whether she is providing the resources to operate the CT scanner in St. John's?  Will she put resources in place to enable the ground floor in St. John's to be opened?  Will she put in place the €47 million proposed in the original report for St. John's?  Will she set a timescale for the provision of the extra facilities, staff and resources in Limerick Regional, for example, that the number of accident and emergency consultants increase to eight, the addition of 135 new acute beds, the increase in the number of ambulances, the high dependency unit and the upgrade of the accident and emergency unit in Limerick regional?  I also call on her to ensure that the accident and emergency departments in St. John's Hospital, Nenagh General Hospital and Ennis General Hospital are left as they are, and that nothing happens until the services in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick are upgraded.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I thank Deputy Reilly for tabling this motion.  I feel very different tonight because I have a number of colleagues around me.  So often in the past few years, I was a lone voice when I spoke about this issue in regard to Monaghan General Hospital.  As Deputy Noonan and Deputy Reilly pointed out, we in the Cavan-Monaghan region have come through much of this.  Seventeen people may not have died if Monaghan General Hospital had not been off call at the time of those deaths.  Unfortunately, we are soon heading back to that kind of situation.  When 41 doctors advise that they are worried about this, yet we are told at the same time that everything is fine, then one wonders where are the structures that allow for discussions to take place.One of my colleagues on the Government side asked the Minister of the day why there was such an undue haste about the issue.  Another of my colleagues on the Government side, Deputy O'Hanlon, clearly stated that what is left in Monaghan General Hospital is safe.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case now.  What is often promised is not delivered, and even though we have been told over the past few months that things would be ready in a matter of weeks, they are still not ready or tested.I remember when the maternity unit was taken out of Monaghan.  I did not object to it at the time, because I could understand the rationale behind it.  We would be catered for in Cavan and in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is supposed to be the specialist maternity hospital for the region.  Yet the Neary issue has caused tremendous trouble to many people.  As some people were on the wrong side of a particular date, they still have not been compensated.  In more recent times, the wife of a good friend of mine lost her life, as did her child.  The reason given for their deaths was pressure on the system.  The people involved could not deal with what was happening.I ask the Minister to take all these things into account.  The issue is about saving money.  One cannot think that this is about saving money or lives when we look at the history of Monaghan.  I do not know where the money being saved is going.  Close to €6 million was spent on two wards in Monaghan, and these will now be completely restructured.  A CT scanner and beds are lying in storage outside Monaghan town, for which rent is being paid.  There is no effort to save money or otherwise.  I was in Monaghan General Hospital late last night visiting a friend, and I noticed that staff are in a quandary as they do not know what the future holds.  I was in Cavan a week ago, and I could see how difficult the situation has become.  Our experience is that Cavan and Monaghan can no longer cope.  I warn my colleagues that the same situation will occur in Nenagh and Ennis.Let nobody be in any doubt that this is a Fianna Fáil Government supported policy.  The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, made it clear in his speech that it is Government policy to repeat what it is doing in Monaghan in both Ennis and Nenagh.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I support Deputy Reilly on this issue.  I am not from the region concerned, but I am close to it.  Why does the Minister think that the people in Ennis and Nenagh are scared at the moment?  Why does she think that ordinary law-abiding people will come out in their thousands in opposition to this?  These people also believe in centres of excellence, as any right-thinking person would do.  However, they genuinely believe from experience that something will happen in the regional hospital in Limerick, and nothing will happen in Nenagh and Ennis.There is a similar proposal for University College Hospital Galway and the west.  How would the Minister expect the people of Tuam to react to guarantees given by her Government over ten years that the community hospital in Tuam would be built?  As far as I can see, things are getting worse, yet this hospital was supposed to complement UCHG.  Certain things would be done there that could be carried out within 20 miles of the hospital, so that people would not have to be brought in by ambulance.The Teamwork report could not have been more clear when it stated that no acute service will be withdrawn from the current general hospitals until the regional centre of excellence is resourced.  The Minister has been a good few years in her current job, for which she is well paid.  While the goal of creating centres of excellence is shared by everybody, I cannot understand her methods of bringing people towards that goal.  Is she gone to the stage where she feels she must act like a dictator?  Does she feel that whether the people come with her or not, she is right all the time and that this will have to happen?  People have to be made understand that this is being done in their best interests, but if the people of Nenagh, Ennis or west Clare are asked whether this is the case, they will say that it could not be further from the truth.  They believe that there will be a downgrading in their areas, and there will be no way back when it happens.Even though the Minister has broken many promises, she should at least ensure that she does things locally.  I guarantee her that if this happens in Nenagh, Ennis and elsewhere, she will have little trouble with the centres of excellence.  We were talking with the president of the IMO last week on the health committee, and about the importance of primary medicine at a local level.  He threw his hands up in the air and told us that we are making very little progress.  How can the Minister expect people to believe that the likes of the Mid-Western Hospital in Limerick will not become a dumping ground for all these cases, and that they will not be able to control it?

In his contribution, Deputy Reilly referred to the issue of me being accused of criminal negligence.  I ask Deputy Reilly to reflect on that.  I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his co-operation in that regard.  I can take political accusations, but I am not going to accept that.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	270	That is the Minister's fault.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The accident and emergency unit in Nenagh deals with an average of six or seven patients each night and the equivalent unit in Ennis deals with an average of nine patients each night.  Can Deputy Reilly, as a doctor, stand over that?  The units are not staffed by doctors who are trained in emergency medicine.  The staff of the units do not even report to emergency consultants, surgeon consultants or physician consultants.

This reform is being driven by medical evidence of what is in the best interests of delivering good outcomes for patients.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I remind Deputy Reilly, who may wish to challenge that assertion, that I can quote from many reports, including a World Health Organisation report, in support of it.  When Deputy Reilly and I participated in a discussion on RTE the other night, we watched a film clip in which Dr. O'Donnell spoke about an increase of 25% in mortality rates.  The World Health Organisation has estimated that the increase might be as high as 50%.  Is there any Member of this House who would not bring his or her sick daughter, son, mother, father, brother or sister to the hospital that offered that person the best chance of recovery?

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I ask Deputies to allow the Minister to make her contribution.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	287	We have a responsibility to make sure we do not continue with a status quo that does not give patients a chance to enjoy the best possible outcomes, particularly in respect of surgical procedures.  By international standards, we have enough people with specialist knowledge in anaesthetics and surgery to deliver emergency surgery in the mid-west region.  There are more than 400 hospital doctors and more than 1,400 nurses in the region.  We cannot deliver the best service there if it is fragmented across four hospitals.  Just 28 surgical procedures took place at Ennis General Hospital during the night over a six-month period.  The relevant figure in Nenagh General Hospital was 12 and in St. John’s Hospital was 21.  Between the three hospitals, there were 60 surgical procedures during the night over the six months in question.  We all know that doctors’ skills cannot be maintained, and good patient outcomes cannot be delivered, if there is low-volume activity in high-volume specialties.  I do not say that merely on the basis of evidence from Ireland.  What we are seeking to do in Ireland is being put into practice in virtually every country in the world that I have examined.  I have spoken to my ministerial colleagues across Europe, who took these steps many years ago.  It has also been done in Northern Ireland.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Notwithstanding Deputy O'Donnell's contribution, I note that the Fine Gael motion does not mention keeping emergency services in St. John's Hospital, or extending them to seven days.  I understand that the HSE is in discussions with the hospital authorities on that matter.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	292	That is good to hear.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	293	That was not referred to in the motion.  Deputy Reilly mentioned the reference to 135 beds in the Teamwork-Howarth report.  The report said that 135 beds would be needed if the specialist orthopaedic hospital in Croom and the stand-alone maternity hospital were to be closed, and we were not to have elective procedures in Ennis and Nenagh.  As we are not doing those things, we do not need 135 beds.  We will have elective procedures in Nenagh and Ennis, to where the doctors and surgeons will travel.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	294	It will be day surgery only.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	295	That was not envisaged in the Teamwork-Howarth report.  We are not closing the stand-alone maternity hospital or the orthopaedic hospital in Croom.  That is why the issue of the 135 beds does not arise.  In the context of a debate on a matter as important as this — it was chosen as the subject of Fine Gael's Private Members' time — we should deal with the facts that are before us.The issue of consultant manpower in the region was also raised.  We are currently recruiting two radiologists and one pathologist, with a specialty in cancer, for the cancer programme in Limerick Regional Hospital.  We will recruit two more emergency consultants, thereby increasing to five the number of such consultants.  They will all work together.  We will have three new radiologists, three pathologists, a dermatologist, a neurologist and rheumatologist.  I want to talk about them because they are new to the region.  They will provide services in Ennis for the patients of County Clare and in Nenagh for the patients of north Tipperary.  At the moment, 700 patients per year come from County Tipperary to Limerick for diagnostic procedures, including CT scanning.  A further 1,000 patients come from Ennis for such procedures.  From the summer of this year, those procedures will be performed in the local hospitals in Ennis and Nenagh.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	296	We were told that last year as well.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I assure the Deputy that the staffing implications are being dealt with.  I think everybody will acknowledge that this reform is being headed by a clinician, Mr. Burke, who is well respected in the region.  He is enthusiastic about the reform and is seeking to engage with his consultant colleagues and others in the region.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	298	Have they got the money to do it?

I will deal with that in a moment.  Even if no money were available in the morning, it would not be possible to maintain what we have in the region.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	302	On Thursday of this week, we will outline the Government's response to the report of the patient safety commission.  The commission, which was chaired by Dr. Madden, included patient safety advocates and experts from Ireland and overseas.  The commission's report has been published, and Deputies are aware that it recommends the establishment of a system of accreditation or licensing in our acute hospitals.  It will take us some time to draft that legislation.  Even if the legislation could be implemented in the morning, many of the acute hospital services we provide could not be licensed or implemented as they do not live up to the requisite patient safety standards.  That is a fact in Ireland and globally.  We have to prepare for the challenge of putting a licensing and accreditation system at the heart of our acute hospital service, so that it is fundamentally organised on the basis of patient safety and good outcomes.  When we took similar steps in our cancer service, that was opposed too.  I am delighted to say that the reorganisation of breast services is ahead of schedule and will be completed by April of this year.  There is almost unanimous buy-in, although not total buy-in.  People who were initially sceptical and concerned, as we often are when change takes place, have become enthusiastic fans of what we are doing in the cancer area.  They know it will improve outcomes for patients.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	303	The numbers seeking the service in Galway is such that the system is bursting at the seams, while the service has not even arrived in Sligo.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I will deal now with capacity issues.  Reference was made to the capacity of the accident and emergency department in Limerick Regional Hospital.  On approximately two or three occasions last year patients had to wait more than six hours in that department.  That is a fact.  As Deputy Reilly knows, patients are treated on trolleys all the time; sometimes the only treatment provided to a patient is while he or she is on a trolley.  That is the case not only in hospitals in Ireland but in hospitals throughout the world.  The fact that at any one time a given number of people are on a trolley does not prove any point the Deputy Reilly is trying to make.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	305	The Minister should tell us about the pleasant experience they have on them.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The performance of the accident and emergency department in Limerick Regional Hospital is better than most.  The hospital is challenged to provide services and that is the reason a unit with 40 critical care beds for high dependency patients will be provided.

The reason it is outrageous, to use his phraseology, is because of the way we organise services.  We have people on call in four hospitals in that region at night to deal with a very low level of activity in three of those hospitals.  Not only does it not make sense from a financial point of view, it does not deliver high patient safety outcomes for the patients who visit these hospitals.  This has nothing to do with the doctors or the staff, it has to do with the manner in which——-
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Would the Minister care to cite the rest of the quote?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	321	——we have sought to organise services.Deputy Reilly talked about the letters I get from doctors.  I get letters advising me that this and that is outrageous and asking if they could only have a little bit more here and there.  That is what we have done for the past 12 to 14 years.  We have multiplied nearly fivefold the amount of money going into our acute hospital services.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Senior consultants have expressed concern, not outrage.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	324	We will not get it by putting the cart before the horse.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The most important thing for patients is to be treated in the right place at the right time by the right people.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I agree.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	327	That is a fact.  If somebody is involved in a road accident, the place that person should be stabilised is on the roadside.  That is the international evidence.  We have trained up to 12 paramedics, six for each county.  We have already procured two specialist vehicles, which Deputy Reilly does not acknowledge, one for each county.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I do.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	329	In Tipperary at night there is one call out.  We have 12 paramedics in training, we have recruited 12 additional ambulance crew and I accept there are industrial relations issues.  International evidence suggests that the best place to stabilise a traffic accident patient is on the roadside.  The golden hour or two hour rule in terms of receiving treatment is not about getting to a place called a hospital.  An unfortunate accident occurred in Deputy Connaughton's area last night and, tragically, one person died at the scene and the other person died in hospital.  Half of all the people who die everyday in Ireland die in hospital.  It is not a question of just going to a hospital, it is about getting the people in a specialist centre as quickly as possible.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The people involved in the accident to which the Minister refers were brought to the hospital in Ballinasloe.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	331	In regard to trauma cases, protocols are already in place in Ennis and Nenagh general hospitals to take those patients to Limerick Regional Hospital.  That is the current arrangement.  Those patients are supposed to be taken to Limerick and are not supposed to be taken to either Nenagh or Ennis.Hospital services and the re-organisation of them have always been a challenge for us in this country.  If we were starting to put in place a hospital infrastructure today, we would never build 35 acute hospitals around the country.  We know that trying to get specialists, not only domestically but internationally, is a challenge.  Those specialists work in a an extraordinary fragmented fashion.  We have 4,800 junior hospital doctors and 2,100 consultants, therefore, we have many doctors working in hospitals.  Many of them deal with very low numbers of patients.  To allocate more staff to a system that is not properly organised around patient safety in order to deliver good outcomes would not make any sense, no matter who writes the letters.I met a group of people from Ennis.  The HIQA report will be published soon and we will see what it has to say about how we organise services.  We live in an environment where we have a new organisation independent of the provider of services, funded by the taxpayer to set and monitor standards and to carry out inquires where it is considered there is a  risk to the patient's care or welfare.  That is what that organisation has been doing.  For the first time in the past few years, we have had inquiries into wrongdoings, which have been very revealing.  We can either bury those reports or  pretend more of the same will get us over the findings of a report or we can change things.  That is what we are seeking to do.The president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland was clear when he said we want critically ill surgical patients to be brought to centres that are appropriately equipped and staffed where there is a sufficient volume of this kind of activity to sustain the necessary levels of skills.  He went on to say, it is precisely at these times that changes can be made with sensible costings rather than the over-exuberant plans and unrealistic budgeting that is sometimes mentioned.  He clearly indicated, contrary to Deputy Reilly's speech, that, as president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the training body for surgeons in Ireland, the reforms in the mid-west are appropriate as far as he is concerned.Patient safety is not only about organising services differently in our hospitals, it also involves how we regulate professions working in the health care area.  We recently modernised how we regulate medical practitioners.  We have a lay majority in that respect.  We have a different procedure as far as fitness to practice is concerned where hearings can be held in public other than on an exceptional basis, where doctors are mandated by law to maintain their competence.  Many of those provisions, particularly the lay majority one, was opposed by the Opposition.The same position applies to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland where there is also a lay majority.  For the first time in more than 100 years we have an appropriate regime in regard to the regulation of the pharmacy profession.  Shortly we will have a new nurses Bill, subsequently a dentists Bill and so on.Patient safety is about the organisation of services, but it also about the regulation of the professions.  In particular, it is about ensuring that those who work in medicine maintain their skill base.  We know in our heart — Deputy Reilly, as a doctor, in particular, knows this — that one cannot maintain one's skill in an accident and emergency department, particularly if one is not a consultant with specialty training, and certainly if one is only dealing with six, eight or nine patients a night.  Nobody can maintain or even acquire a skill in that kind of environment.  We must learn from the evidence and be courageous enough to act on it.  The Government knows this and that is why it is so enthusiastic for the reform.  It also knows reform will be difficult and many people will be worried.  The reason they will be worried is that politicians are telling them that they are going to die.

Of course, they would be concerned.  We all have our own concerns.  Discussions are taking place with the general practitioners.In regard to senior medics, particularly the surgeons working in the mid-west, I do not know to whom Deputy Noonan spoke this morning.  He seemed to have a Fine Gael perspective on the world.  No Government has reduced tax more, as that consultant should know, than the parties that have been in Government for the past 12 years.  Therefore, I do not understand why he thought we did not reduce tax.  However, Deputy Noonan presumably has his own friends who talk about death and taxes, but I have spoken to many consultants not only in the mid-west but throughout the country and I know that many people working in medicine in Ireland are enthusiastic about the reform——

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I welcome this opportunity to discuss the issue of reconfiguration of medical services in the mid-west region.  Health is an emotive issue and the advent of change generates fear and uncertainty in the minds of the public at large.  While that fear may be well-founded in some cases, the efforts by some vested interests to mislead and misguide is unfortunate and unnecessary.The current position on the delivery of health services in the mid-west, and Clare in particular, is unacceptable.  Patients are confronted with unnecessary risk on a daily basis.   A number of cases have been highlighted in the media which have created a bad impression of Ennis.  That has been difficult for those people and their families and the outcome was not acceptable.  Notwithstanding that, it is my understanding that similar cases happen throughout the smaller hospital network and there is a requirement to address that.According to Dr. Cathal O'Donnell, an accident and emergency consultant in the region, the chance of a better outcome for the patient can be increased by up to 25%, based on existing case data.  He has staked his reputation on this claim.  He has also stated on record that mortality rates in the region will reduce as this reconfiguration is implemented.The Minister already quoted Professor Frank Keane, president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  In a letter to The Irish Times in January this year, he stated:I would like to reaffirm that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland is convinced that the reform should continue in the mid-west and elsewhere where these changes are necessary and, in many cases, long overdue.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland's motive is first and foremost to achieve better and safer patient care.  We want critically ill surgical patients to be brought to the centres that are appropriately equipped and staffed and where there is sufficient volume of this kind of activity to sustain the necessary levels of skills to manage these patients.  Timing is often an issue and therefore patient transfer from hospital to hospital should be kept to a minimum.That complies with international best practice which seems to suggest, as the Minister stated, that stabilisation should take place at the earliest possible time in the case of a road traffic accident on the roadside and, in the case of another trauma, at the particular site of that event.These are just two of the many clinicians who have called for, and who support, the proposals contained in the programme of service delivery reconfiguration in the region.As a public representative with no medical training, other than being the son of a well-qualified but retired nurse, it is incumbent on me to listen and heed the advice of such eminent medics.  Regardless of my hunches or any desire to be politically expedient, I cannot, in good conscience, ignore the advice of these professionals who have taken an oath which places upon them a burden to protect their patients.  Patient safety, reduced mortality and better outcomes are the cornerstones of this reconfiguration.

I am prepared to put the facts before the people and to accept the advice of the senior clinicians in the region.  There are other people running around this country who are not prepared to back up what they say with any level of evidence other than "dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi".  That does not work for me and it does not work for the patients in County Clare.  I will be surprised if it works for the patients in the Dingle Peninsula whom the Deputy represents.

The geographical spread of County Clare, as I am sure Deputy Carey will agree when he speaks later, will require extra ambulances and extra ambulance personal.  It will require advanced paramedics.  There are particular geographical matters between east and west Clare.  East Clare currently has a period from 7 p.m. to 12 a.m. without ambulance cover and we must address that.  We must address the issue of west Clare.  I know the Minister has frequented Loop Head and she will know it is 80 miles from Limerick.  The fact that ambulances will be out of the county for longer periods of time requires that investment.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	359	That is the golden hour.  One cannot get from Loop Head to Limerick in an hour.

Engagement with Shannon Doc services is necessary to provide the people of County Clare with access to appropriate services on the hospital site.  I believe there is need for an extra eight consultants and 12 advanced paramedics and also for that critical care block required at Limerick Regional Hospital.  Capital investment in Ennis is long overdue.  Unfortunately, it has not been advanced as quickly as all of us would have liked.We cannot put the cart before the horse.  I know the Minister is committed to ensuring that support is put in place to allow the reconfiguration to proceed without delay in order that patients in the mid west are given the best possible chance for a positive outcome.  Collectively, we can all reduce unnecessary deaths.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	363	——contributed to the demise of the health services.  If we are honest we must ask what was the result.  We had deficits in funding, infrastructure, human resources and strategy.  Everything has had to play catch-up in the past 12 to 15 years.  We must acknowledge the levels of funding now available.  We have invested in our infrastructures.  Hospitals are being built and improved.  Our human resources are being improved.  We are engaging more consultants, doctors and nurses, all frontline staff of the kind that everybody wants to see.  We have a redundancy programme coming down the line for the administration staff that everybody has a problem with, whom people seem to want to lose.Let us keep this in context.  I welcome the recent coverage and debate we have had in respect of reconfiguration in the mid west.  It was refreshing to see an input from independent people who work on the frontline.  That was the first time in a long while that we have not had the entire debate crowded by politicians, including all of us in this House, thereby letting it descend into a political slagging match.These are the frontline people who are charged with the delivery of the service and they have staked their reputations on that.  Let us listen to them because they are qualified, independent and they know their work.  I am certainly happy to buy into what they say.  I mention, in particular, Paul Burke and Cathal O'Donnell.I can understand the concern expressed by people in counties Clare and Tipperary.  However, there is a change.  For the people in those counties to whom I speak — in my party we do not confine ourselves merely to our own constituencies — in Tipperary, Nenagh and Ennis——

It is equally important to point out that Cathal O'Donnell and Paul Burke have a shared responsibility for the region, not only for the accident and emergency department in my local hospital, namely, the regional hospital.For Limerick Regional Hospital and its accident and emergency department, I welcome the fact that this initiative will deliver a new emergency operating theatre, an expanded ambulance service and a critical care block that will bring in up to 40 beds when it is built.  I am sure this will be delivered.

This is not a criticism but I would like to see more investment in GP training and more places for GP trainees in the mid west.  We have had a number of female GPs who, due to life responsibilities and family circumstances, cannot work on a full-time basis and we need more training places.Any debate about the HSE showers that agency with negativity, which reflects on its staff.  For my part, I wish to thank the staff of the HSE in the mid west for their service and dedication, for their professionalism and for the approach they take to their jobs on an everyday basis in difficult circumstances.  I do not think it is fair there should be negative reflection on them.The Fine Gael motion, as tabled, states that "regularly" 15 to 30 people are on trolleys.  That is a very liberal use of the word "regularly".  I was in the accident and emergency department a couple of days ago and did not see anybody on trolleys.  I was in the hospital a week ago and did not see anybody on trolleys.  I had occasion, as I told Deputy Reilly outside the House——

I went in the door that led to the accident and emergency department and presented myself.  There were 15 people ahead of me and I was No. 16.  They were all seen within 25 minutes, I was seen within half an hour and nobody was on a trolley.  I do not know how regular, or how liberal, is the use of that word "regular" but I believe it is abused.

The problem with this matter is one of trust.  The Minister put forward a fine, spirited argument in this House about why what she was doing was what she felt to be right, but the whole system is predicated on services being in place in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital and in the community that are not in place.  When I asked the Minister when the critical care unit would be available in that hospital she was not able to tell me.  She is well able to tell us when surgical activities and night time accident and emergency services will be closed in Ennis and Nenagh, but not when the facilities that are meant to be in place, and which the Teamwork report says are a predicate to the changes, will be in place.  It is a problem of trust.  Unfortunately, there is no trust in the mid-west that the reconfiguration plan will be anything other than a money saving exercise which will hurt patients.I listened to Deputy Crawford earlier in the debate.  I respect him very much.  He does not exaggerate but is a very responsible Deputy.  He said 17 people in Monaghan may not have died if what happened in the north east had not happened.

We must see that exactly the same is coming down the tracks for us in the mid-west if we take this on trust, particularly in the context of the financial situation.  Last week a HSE west meeting was told that a further €10 million will be taken from the acute hospital budget in the mid-west on top of the €400 million that was taken off at the end of last year after the service plan had been published.  That is the reality of the cuts coming down the tracks.  How are we supposed to believe the Minister?  That is the problem.Dr. Paul Burke and his colleagues are very genuine people who believe what they are doing is right, but there are many GPs in the mid-west, who are also highly trained doctors and who know their patients very well, and they are unanimously against this proposal.  I have spoken to many who work in the hospitals in the mid-west who are extremely worried about this proposal and, above all, the patients and the public are extremely worried about it.  I attended the meeting in Nenagh recently and intend to attend the protest on 21 February in Nenagh.  I assume there will also be protests in Ennis.  I listened to those people.  There were so many people there that hundreds of them were out in the rain because they could not fit into the venue.  It was a huge meeting of ordinary people who live in north Tipperary — doctors, nurses, patients of the hospital and their relatives.  They are genuinely fearful about what is being proposed.My colleague, Senator Kelly, said people in the mid-west should be very afraid and, unfortunately, he is right because the theory is great but, unfortunately, we cannot trust the practice.  The people who would otherwise go to Nenagh and Ennis will all descend on a regional hospital that is already overstretched and overcrowded.  We hope St. John's is safe, but we are not quite sure and want undertakings in that regard.  Neither the Minister nor the HSE has been able to give us any commitment that the money will be spent on what is identified in the plan as needed.If we were to accept this on trust we would need our heads examined.  The plan is supposed to be predicated on more comprehensive primary and community care, long-stay beds, diagnostics, day-care beds, a medical assessment unit, a critical care unit in Limerick, more ambulances and more ambulance personnel.  These are all good things but the problem is that there is no money in the kitty to provide them.

She talked about rolling out the HPV vaccine for 12 year old girls next year but she has gone back on that.  She talks a very good talk but, unfortunately, she does not deliver.  The Minister and the HSE promised that specific actions to improve overcrowding in the accident and emergency unit in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital would be provided if it went along with her plans three years ago, and it did.  The hospital was at the top of the list and was supposed to get extra consultants as a reward, but they were never delivered.

Again, we are offered more consultants but it is always in the future.  However, they are not in place, so how are we supposed to believe the Minister?The crowd that turned out in Nenagh knew the issues very well.  They know we need a major specialist centre.  I have no problem with the Minister's plan and agree that people with severe trauma due to, for example, road traffic accidents, no matter where in the region they come from, should be stabilised at the side of the road and taken to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick.  That is true and I have no problem with it.  However, that is only a tiny minority of patients who use the hospital services in the mid-west.  People feel very strongly, and I agree with them, that hospitals the size of Nenagh, Ennis or St. John's have much to contribute to people with more common conditions, who need surgical procedures closer to home or who need a more straightforward access to their hospital than they can get through the channel of the accident and emergency unit in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital.  Those people are also stakeholders and are entitled to be involved in the debate.  That is why my colleague, Senator Kelly, and I published the Teamwork report when we received it.  We had planned to publish it, as the Minister knows, on a Monday when we released our press release.  The HSE and the Minister rushed to publish it so they could have——

Is it not possible, for example, for the consultants in Limerick to supervise the accident and emergency departments in Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's and be responsible for what goes on in them without having to centralise everything in Limerick?  That should be examined.

There is a major lack of trust about what the Minister plans to do.  I would like to quote from the report:The overriding principle will be that no services will be withdrawn from the current general hospitals prior to the build-up of new, alternative services, i.e. that the Regional Hospital will be resourced, developed and working to recognised to international, best-practice standards.Will the Minister stand over that?  From what she has said already tonight she will not because she has already told us those services will not be in place when she removes the services in Ennis and Nenagh.

I will again quote from the HSE west report given to representatives last week:2009 will be a very challenging year in providing the existing level of services with significantly reduced resources requiring ongoing monitoring of the budget situation.  Where adverse budget variances are identified [that is lovely HSE speak] measures which may have implications for the level of service provided will need to be taken swiftly to ensure a break-even position by year-end.It will all be driven by money.  We have no confidence that the Minister will implement the required services.  There is a need for a debate on the role of secondary hospitals in this country.  We have not had that debate.  They have an important role, as do tertiary and larger hospitals and the community.  We have not had that debate because the Minister will not engage with any stakeholders except the very few who agree with her.

It is the first time any such sign has appeared in that location and it is ominous for the people of north Tipperary.  As the Minister knows, this is a feeling all too familiar to the people of my home county of Monaghan, where exactly the same signage has been in place since March 2001.  While that sign was going up in Nenagh to turn away women and children, where was the Minister?  She was walking a red carpet rolled out by her friend Ulick McEvaddy at his private, for-profit Vista health unit in Naas.  This so-called health campus was built as a business venture by Mr. McEvaddy who, as we recall well, in 1999 hosted both the Minister herself and the former Minister for Finance and fellow Kildare man Charlie McCreevy in his luxury villa in the south of France.  It is no wonder Mr. McEvaddy and his likes are the beneficiaries of massive tax breaks courtesy of this Government's health privatisation agenda.

It went on to state: "However, she was not able to comment on the current beds crisis at Naas General Hospital."  I bet she was not.Hand in hand with privatisation goes the disastrous centralisation of our public hospitals.  Monaghan has been the blueprint for the centralisation of hospital services in this State.  We now face the threat of the axing in 2009 of all inpatient acute care in Monaghan General Hospital.  Monaghan's average of 3,000 acute medical admissions per year will have to be catered for predominantly by Cavan General Hospital, which is already severely overstretched.  The outlook for Ennis, Nenagh and other smaller hospitals is similar if the plans of the Government and the HSE go ahead.  It will mean loss of services, long distances to travel for patients and further pressure on other hospitals without the provision of additional beds and staff to meet the need.Nenagh hospital has set a high standard of service for smaller hospitals, and its close relationship with local GPs in terms of access and admission is an example that should be followed.  A report on Nenagh hospital in 2006 found that 97% of cases sent to the hospital were safely treated and only 3% required transfer to Limerick.  GPs in Clare, north Tipperary, Cavan and Monaghan have all come out strongly against the HSE plans in recent weeks.  However, the Government and the HSE, as I had occasion to hear clearly only last Thursday when I met the Minister and Professor Drumm, in pursuing their centralisation and privatisation agenda, are working against the interests of patients and against the advice of front line health care providers.The HSE report on accident and emergency services in the mid-west was jointly authored by Teamwork, the British-based management consultants whose recommendations form the basis for the current policy of slashing services at local hospitals and over-centralising services in already overstretched regional hospitals.  The report on the mid-west is no different and would see accident and emergency services taken from Ennis and Nenagh, leading to the downgrading of those hospitals and their eventual conversion to glorified day care centres.  Make no mistake about it, that is exactly what will happen.  We are almost at that stage at Monaghan General Hospital, as the Minister knows too well, where the HSE and Government propose to end all acute inpatient services in the early part of this year.In speaking on this motion and against the Government amendment I wish to make it very clear that I am opposed to the plans arising from the Teamwork-Howarth report, Review of Acute Hospital Services in HSE Mid-west, which provide for centralisation in Limerick.  Lest there be any misunderstanding, Sinn Féin does not support a position which says that if all these contingencies are put in place then centralisation will be acceptable.  It will not be acceptable, full stop and end of story.  Among the recommendations of the Teamwork-Howarth report are, lest we forget, no provision of critical care at the local centre; the removal of acute services in small and medium-sized hospitals; all inpatient beds in Ennis, Nenagh, St. John's, St. Munchin's and St. Nessan's hospitals to close; and asset-stripping, namely the potential sell-off of St. Munchin's maternity hospital and St. Nessan's orthopaedic hospital, Croom.  These plans are not acceptable.  They are clearly running in parallel with similar plans in my own region and are equally against the interests of patients and of our public health service in general.The Ennis General Hospital Development Committee has stated that the removal of acute surgical facilities from Ennis, as opposed to the proper resourcing of the casualty unit and associated services, will increase the risk to lives in Clare.  They point out that the danger is further heightened for the 44,000 people who will have to undertake a journey to Limerick of between one hour and one hour 45 minutes from the scene of an accident, after a possible 45 minute ambulance response time. The Clare Champion reported on 6 February that it had obtained a HSE document showing there are an average of 50 medical patients occupying surgical beds in Limerick Regional Hospital every day, resulting in cancellations of planned surgery, overcrowding in the accident and emergency unit and longer hospital stays for certain patients.  This is the hospital into which the Government and the HSE wish to centralise all emergency patients from Clare and north Tipperary.  It just will not fit, exactly as the situation in Monaghan and Cavan will not fit.  No matter how often we try to impress that on the Minister, she remains dogged in her determination to move ahead with her foolhardy plans.It is grimly appropriate, while we make mention of foolhardiness, that April fools' day is the target date for the closure of the accident and emergency units in Ennis and Nenagh.  Surgery is to follow some three months later.  GPs in both Clare and north Tipperary are opposing plans for them to provide out-of-hours casualty services in both hospitals.  Consultant geriatrician Dr. Christine O'Malley has expressed her serious concern about the prospect of losing the services of general surgeons from Nenagh.  She said:I have never worked without having surgeons on stand-by in the hospital.  I am concerned that GPs are being asked to work above their level of competence.  Every health professional has to be confident they are working within their level of competence when it comes to the treatment of patients.Limerick Regional Hospital can't meet its own requirements at the moment.  The HSE is devising a plan without looking at the situation on the ground.  Consultants refer patients who need a bed in Limerick on a daily basis and are regularly told there is no bed for them due to overcrowding and the fact that there can be up to 30 people on trolleys.We are determined in Monaghan, and, I hope, in Cavan, to resist the plan to effectively close Monaghan General Hospital — certainly to remove acute medical services from that hospital to Cavan — over the next number of weeks.  I commend the people of Clare and north Tipperary on their support for their local hospitals and their determination to sustain the vital services they provide.  That, at the end of the day, is the most important element in terms of health care provision and the provision of acute hospital services, not only when we need it but — make no mistake about it — even when we do not, for the peace of mind, assurance and confidence to face what each day brings.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.  The number of apprentices who are losing their places daily in the on-the-job part of their apprenticeships is alarming.  Up to the end of November last year, the number of apprentices being displaced from their courses was a trickle.  However, throughout December, January and February there has been a serious loss in the apprentices' work schemes.The data on which the Minister announced the employer-based redundant apprentice rotation scheme in January were incomplete and out of date, even at that time.  They are particularly out of date now.  I hope the Minister of State can provide more up to date figures that reflect the reality of what is happening to many apprentices today.  The trades the Minister mentioned, that is, carpentry and joinery, electrical, plastering, plumbing and bricklaying, relate to the construction industry.  However, many other apprentices in other areas have lost their apprenticeships.It is a great credit to the management of the ESB that it has come to the rescue of this scheme by offering 400 places.  The construction industry and its leaders, particularly the former Minister of State, Mr. Tom Parlon, should stand up for the many apprentices who have lost their apprenticeships in the construction industry and in areas related to it.  It is important, even at this late stage, that they come forward and make some contribution towards the re-employment of apprentices who have lost their jobs.  FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs are combining to seek employment for apprentices.  That indicates the lack of knowledge they have of the situation and the availability of jobs in this country.  Jobs are simply not available in the construction industry unless Mr. Parlon comes forward to support apprentices or provide for them in one way or another.The provision of €4 million for the FÁS scheme is totally inadequate given the numbers that are now unemployed.  Why FÁS has been the sole agency responsible for the off-work training element of apprenticeships is baffling.  The VECs have many excellent programmes available and it is regrettable that this facility has been refused.  Likewise, the institutes of technology have many places available in worthwhile schemes that are appropriate for many of the apprentices who have been displaced.  The amount of money available is totally inadequate.  I urge the Minister immediately to broaden the number of people and companies that can take on apprentices.  Let the example given by the ESB be replicated by many other State companies.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Since the beginning of last year, there has been a significant contraction in activity in the construction sector.  As a result of this contraction, we have witnessed a substantial reduction in the number of people employed in the construction sector in the past 12 months.  This has had a severe impact on the individuals who are currently undertaking an apprenticeship.  The scale of the downturn in the construction sector is clear when one considers that at the end of last month the apprenticeship population was 22,561.  For the same period last year, the apprenticeship population was 28,252, which represents a 20% reduction in a 12 month period.  In addition to this decrease, by the end of last month FÁS has been notified of 3,695 apprentices who have been made redundant.The high level of redundant apprentices is of particular concern given the structure of the Irish apprenticeship system.  Our apprenticeship system is a demand-driven educational and training programme for employed people aimed at developing the skills of the apprentice to meet the needs of industry and the labour market.  It consists of seven phases divided into four on-the-job and three off-the-job phases.  An apprentice is required to be employed so that they can complete the necessary on-the-job training.  The on-the-job training is designed to enable the apprentice to develop the skill, knowledge and competence to reach the required level of mastery in their trade.  This implies that apprentices who have been made redundant are, therefore, not in a position to complete their apprenticeship.The Government is fully aware of the difficult situation in which these redundant apprentices find themselves.  For that reason, the Government is committed to assisting redundant apprentices gain employment as soon as possible in Ireland or abroad in order that these individuals may complete their apprenticeships.  The Tánaiste, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Education and Science have been working closely with FÁS, the institutes of technology, the Higher Education Authority and the social partners on introducing measures in an effort to address the problems now confronting redundant apprentices.The measures that have been introduced to date will help in alleviating the current situation and comprise the following.  The  Department of Social and Family Affairs immediately refers redundant apprentices to FÁS for assistance.  Following this immediate referral, the FÁS employment services and FÁS services to business divisions work in collaboration to assist the apprentice source a new approved employer to allow them to complete their apprenticeship as soon as possible.  To date, FÁS has succeeded in securing alternative employment for 1,081 apprentices who have been made redundant, but in excess of 3,600 apprentices remain redundant.  In addition, in the absence of options for workplace experience, FÁS has put in place an interim measure whereby apprentices who are made redundant can progress to the next off-the-job training phase in the education sector.  This means they do not need to do their on-the-job phase and can go directly to the next off-the-job phase, in line with the current scheduling criteria.At the end of last year, under this interim measure a total of 439 redundant apprentices were attending an off-the-job phase two, four and six and a further 505 redundant apprentices were scheduled to attend one of these phases in the coming months.  FÁS is also looking at the advantages that EU-sponsored programmes that facilitate mobility for workers and apprentices can offer.  In October last year, for example, FÁS was successful in responding to a national call for mobility projects under the Leonardo da Vinci programme, which is the EU's vocational educational training programme.  As a result, approximately 25 redundant apprentices will complete a period of on-the-job training in suitable European companies, thereby facilitating the completion of their apprenticeships.In addition to these measures, at the end of last year the Tánaiste announced the launch of a new FÁS initiative aimed at providing the necessary on-the-job experience to redundant apprentices.  This initiative is called the employer-based redundant apprentice rotation scheme.  The purpose of the scheme is to give up to 500 redundant apprentices the opportunity to complete the on-the-job phase of their apprenticeship in order to gain the required knowledge, skill and competence to successfully progress to the next off-the-job phase or to complete their apprenticeship.  Employers who have a past record of providing consistent systematic training are being asked to provide redundant apprentices with an opportunity to complete their on-the-job phase in the following five trades: carpentry and joinery, electrical, plastering, plumbing and bricklaying.The scheme works on the basis that FÁS will place redundant apprentices with an eligible employer, to replace any existing apprentices that have been released to attend scheduled off-the-job phases of their apprenticeship.  The employer will provide the necessary workplace training and assessment to the redundant apprentice.  The scheme will support redundant apprentices' on-the-job training related to phases three, five and seven.Employers participating in the scheme are required to pay the apprentice the agreed industry rates for the specific apprenticeship trade and FÁS will make a contribution of €340 per week towards employment costs incurred based on a 39-hour working week.

#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Community employment schemes, in their present format, are totally unsuitable for the current unemployment crisis.  One must be unemployed and in receipt of a social welfare payment for 12 months to get on a CE scheme and if one works for one or two weeks at any time, one must start back again and remain unemployed for 52 weeks to qualify.  These conditions are very severe.There needs to be leverage on eligibility criteria for CE schemes.  One way would be to reduce the unemployment criteria to six months and give applicants six months on a CE scheme rather than the present format where one must be 12 months unemployed and when one gets a place on a CE scheme one can stay on it for three to four years.  This would give genuine people with qualifications in child care, health care, office management, etc. who find themselves unemployed an opportunity to qualify for a place on a CE scheme.  The benefit will be in getting work experience and preparing them for the labour market.The objectives in the present climate should be to give as many unemployed people as possible a place on a CE scheme to ensure they can upskill and return to the workforce as quickly and efficiently as possible.The increasing numbers on the live register are causing serious upset.  People become very agitated when they see jobs advertised locally and apply for them only to find that they do not qualify because of the 12 month unemployment criterion.  At times vacant posts are not filled despite the high unemployment figures due to the present strict criteria.Many people who find themselves unemployed desperately want to get back into the workforce.  The CE schemes are vital to ensure that they get upskilled and reskilled, and also that they will be prepared when the upturn occurs.  I ask the Minister of State to look seriously at this matter.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I thank Deputy Feighan for raising this issue.The FÁS community employment programme is an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed-term basis.  Community employment helps unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and assisting them to enhance both their technical and personal skills.CE is not designed to cater for short-term unemployed persons as they are not as far removed from the open labour market as the main client group for the programme.  All CE places are filled on an ongoing basis, as the demand always exceeds the number of places available.  FÁS also provides a range of programmes aimed specifically at the short-term unemployed, details of which are available from any FÁS employment services office, any local employment service office or from the FÁS website.I am advised by FÁS that CE positions in the Roscommon area are currently filled to budgeted capacity.  In terms of partaking in short-term employment prior to commencing CE, breaks from the live register up to a maximum of 30 days in the 12 months prior to application are allowed in assessing eligibility for CE.Funding for CE in 2009 has been provided with a view to maintaining overall numbers on FÁS schemes.  At present there are more than 22,000 people participating on CE schemes nationally.  In delivering these places, FÁS operates flexibly in the management of this allocation in order to maximise progression to the labour market while at the same time facilitating the support of community services.  This provision of places is managed through a standardised application process between regional FÁS offices and local sponsor and community organisations and any issues regarding the allocation of places are dealt with in this context.  However, it should be remembered that participants, in so far as they remain on CE, are precluding someone else from benefiting from the programme.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.The Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  We are keeping the operation of the scheme under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The issues we are dealing with on the Adjournment today are related because of the recession.  Clearly the issue of placement on CE and that of FÁS training centres are matters of major concern to the unemployed and the constituents we represent.The most recent figures for January bring the number unemployed up to more than 327,000, which is a record number.  According to the Taoiseach, the figure will top the 400,000 mark by the end of the year which, indeed, will be a new record by far.Obviously, there is a major problem presenting itself.  From that point of view the key policy of the Government in this respect should be to ensure that those who lose their jobs, with all this entails, do not end up in long-term unemployment.  This requires that a range of support services be made available.Obviously, what we have heard already in terms of apprentice placements should be examined carefully by FÁS, the DIT and other institutions.  The number on CE schemes should be increased considerably.  There are 22,000 participants at present, as the Minister of State, Deputy Devins, stated earlier.  That has been the number for a long time.  It was 24,000 not so long ago.  The Minister of State could easily double that number.  These are recessionary times.  He might be keeping an eye on what is happening but he would need to do something about it once he sees that it is not adequate to deal with the problem.  My concern is that we ensure that all of these measures, such as the back to education programme, back to work allowance, retraining, reskilling and CE schemes are in place.FÁS, of course, is the major provider of such services for the unemployed particularly in terms of training services.  I refer to one of the major training services provided in the city of Dublin, the Jervis Street FÁS.  It is the only one on the north side of the city in Dublin 1.  The training facilities of that centre are about to close.  In fact, they will be gone within the next few weeks.  It seems unthinkable that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should be closing down training facilities anywhere in the country at this time.  We are about to lose approximately 250 training placements in this centre and that will deprive the entire north side of FÁS training facilities.Most of the staff have been moved from Jervis Street.  The last connections class for the newly unemployed will finish by the end of this week.  The last photography class finishes next month and all the computer, IT and retail classes have closed down.  The premises are virtually idle and the staff have been moved elsewhere.There has been a €2.5 million refurbishment and re-equipment of the D'Olier Street FÁS centre but that deals with employment rather than training services.  The new employment service that will be moved from FÁS to the Peats site in Parnell Street is also an employment service, not a training service.  They are not in any sense replacements for the training services that have been lost.I would remind the Minister of State that in these exceptional times of recession, the expansion of training facilities should be a priority and it really is unconscionable that existing services should be closed down when they are most needed.

The Tánaiste's role is to provide public funding and overall policy direction to FÁS rather than to get involved in its day to day operational management.  Decisions of this nature are day to day operational matters for FÁS as part of its responsibilities under the Labour Services Act 1987.Before I address the Deputy's specific concern about the FÁS office in Jervis Street, I will make a general comment on the facilities it offer its clients on a countrywide level, as well as setting out the financial commitment this Government has made in recent years in ensuring that FÁS continues to provide high quality services to its customers.Through a regional network of 66 offices and 20 training centres, FÁS provides a comprehensive nationwide service of training programmes as well as providing a recruitment service to jobseekers, an advisory resource for industry and support mechanisms for community-based enterprises.  In the past five years the Department invested more than €125 million in capital expenditure alone to ensure that FÁS continues to provide the highest quality facilities for its customers throughout its network.  This investment includes a new state of the art training centre in Tallaght and a complete refurbishment of an existing facility in Ballyfermot.  Major refurbishment projects have also been carried out on FÁS facilities in Finglas, Cork, Sligo and Limerick.To turn to the Deputy's concern regarding the closure of its facilities in Jervis Street, Dublin 1, I understand from FÁS that this facility consists of a training centre, employment services office and also houses the city centre community services staff.  It is the second busiest employment service office in the country, and together with D'Olier House, Dublin 2, accounts for more than 30% of employment services activity in the country.  FÁS has been using these two city centre facilities since the early eighties.  In 2006 the landlord of the premises at Jervis Street was granted planning permission to develop the site and had requested FÁS to vacate the building.  Notwithstanding this the lease for the premises in Jervis Street will expire in July this year.  FÁS has made arrangements for a suitable alternative ground floor location in the area for employment services and community services.  These services will be located in Parnell Street, close to the existing premises.

The expectation is that the premises will be ready and operational by July.FÁS also plans to further develop the Employment Services office at D'Olier House by increasing the public usage area in order to provide its clients with an enhanced walk-in self-service operation.  I understand that the board of FÁS has approved the estimated fit out costs in respect of both premises.On the training services provided by FÁS at the Jervis Street premises, approximately 80% of those who receive training there are from outside the area.  The continuing demographic changes in the city as well as the high costs of renting suitable extensive facilities for training purposes in the area mean that it is more cost-effective to redeploy the city centre training programmes to other Dublin training centres.  Such redeployment has already commenced for longer-term programmes to ensure minimum disruption for the trainees involved.I cannot overemphasise the importance of the role FÁS has to play in the Irish economy and society as this country faces into a very challenging period.  The Government, therefore, remains wholly committed to giving FÁS the resources it needs to continue to provide high quality training and employment services that are relevant to the needs of today's labour market.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this matter.I seldom personalise any issue in the Dáil, but I raise this matter on that basis to show clearly the situation on the ground as far as home help is concerned in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  I do it in light of the fact that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, is explaining that the closure of the two wards in Monaghan hospital will not cause any problem because there are good home help services and packages available.  There is supposed to be an effort to encourage people to stay in their homes for as long as possible, yet here is a specific issue concerning a lady who received seven hours of home help in 2003, which was subsequently reduced to four hours.  On 28 January 2009 she got a letter to say it was being reduced to two hours.With all due respects, what support can an 83 year old woman get from a home help over two hours per week?  If she only takes her into town as the sole outing of the week, that will take up most of the two hours, regardless of the need to keep the house clean and tidy and whatever other supports she needs.  The woman no longer goes to her place of worship, but tries to visit the town once a week.  If she does not, the home help has to do it for her.This is an example of how home help is being delivered, in reality, in the present situation.  We are being lectured by the Minister as regards how many home help hours are available throughout the country and so on, but when it comes down to the individual, that is when it really hurts.  I have another note here from someone in Belturbet, at the other end of the constituency from the woman in Carrickmacross, where a 79 year old lady had her home help reduced from 1.5 hours per week to three-quarters of an hour.  This is really coming down to the level of a joke.  If we want to encourage people to remain in their homes, there should be realistic periods of time allocated for home  help.To return to the example of the first lady, she does not have a family member, relation or anybody else available to her.  She is completely dependent on the home help and the goodness of her neighbours.  Imagine what it would cost the State if this citizen could no longer stay in her own home owing to the lack of home help.  Imagine what subvention top-up and all the rest would have to be paid to a nursing home.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this case and the whole home help situation.I was told the other day by the Minister's representative, Professor Brendan Drumm, that a number of top level personnel would be appointed to the Monaghan region to organise and look after the home help situation there.  However, if the people on the front line, the home help staff and home carers, are not available or not being employed, what is the use, because that is where the patients get the service?  I ask the Minister of State to please ensure that this lady has her four hours of home help restored.I know I am taking a risk in raising this in the Dáil.  The services may see my intervention as an effort to bypass them.  However, I raise this solely as an example of what has been happening all over the area.  The Belturbet case has nothing to do with this, but that is an example where 1.5 hours has been reduced to three-quarters of an hour.  What benefit can home help of three-quarters of an hour be to a 79 year old, living on her own in Belturbet?  I urge the Minister of State to treat the situation seriously.  We have never had as many people unemployed as there are today.  Surely, it would be better to employ people as home help or home carers rather than giving them dole, with nothing to show for it.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this issue, as it provides me with an opportunity to reaffirm the Government's continued commitment to providing services for older people generally and, in particular, the important area of the home help service.  Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care, where appropriate.  This policy approach is renewed and developed in the partnership agreement Towards 2016.The Government's objective of continuing to develop community based services for older persons is reflected in the funding given to the system in recent times.  The total additional funding allocated for such services was in excess of €210 million in the three year period 2006-08, inclusive, of which €55 million was specifically earmarked for the expansion of the home help service.  The new funding was both to enhance existing services such as home help and meals-on-wheels and to widen the range of services available to older people through, for example, the introduction of home care packages.  Home help is the backbone of community based services and includes a range of essential supports that make all the difference to the quality of life of each recipient.  In 2006 almost 11 million home help hours were provided by the HSE.  The executive estimates that it will make available nearly 12 million hours this year, benefiting over 54,000 people nationally.It is important in the context of the issue raised to point out that the home help service has also seen increased professionalisation in recent years with the implementation of the national home help agreement.  This has resulted in greater flexibility in service delivery and improved consistency and service quality through measures such as training to the benefit of service users.The home help service is reviewed regularly at local level by the HSE which has operational responsibility for individual cases.  Professional staff on the front line who are aware of local circumstances undertake individual client assessments.  Services are targeted at clients with a high level of dependency and in accordance with their assessed need.  In such instances the level of service in individual cases may increase, decrease or remain the same, based on the assessed need of the individual.In the context of the issues raised by the Deputy, I understand the person in question recently had a review of her circumstances which resulted in a reduction of her service provision after taking account of various factors such as the recent review and the need to assist others locally waiting for a home help service.  It is open to any individual or person working on his or her behalf such as a GP to request that the situation be reviewed by the HSE should circumstances change.  The Deputy will appreciate that the HSE collates statistics as a matter of routine in respect of the Cavan-Monaghan local health office.  The executive has indicated that in this local health office area some 2,800 clients benefited from the home help service in 2007 and that approximately 3,100 clients received a service in 2008.It is clear that the Government has made considerable improvements in recent years to enhance home help provision generally across the country, including the Cavan-Monaghan area.  There is no doubt that at times demand can exceed service resources.  However, it is a matter for the HSE to deliver services, both nationally and locally, in the context of Government priorities and its overall resources and taking account of the individual circumstances of each case.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 85, 89, 93 and 105 together.Net-metering enables the use of small scale renewable energy projects for domestic households.  It allows the export of electricity back to the grid, reversing the electricity meter in the process.  The result is to offset the cost of electricity bought by the householder.The standard electricity meter installed by ESB Networks in the past does not operate in reverse and cannot therefore support a net-metering programme.  My Department is working with Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB and the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) to bring forward alternative ways of encouraging the use of micro-scale renewable energy technologies.An alternative approach is to provide a guaranteed price for electricity exported to the grid from micro-scale projects.  The REFIT support scheme, which is administered by my Department, provides fixed prices for electricity from new renewable energy powered plants.  However, generators must source and contract with an electricity supplier such as ESB or Viridian to purchase the power.  The supplier in turn is compensated at pre-set fixed levels for the additional costs they incur in purchasing and trading the electricity.The commercial interest of Electricity suppliers is in purchasing power from larger scale projects producing electricity in commercial quantities only.  Micro-scale plants are of a much smaller size requiring a different solution.My Department is currently working closely with the CER and other stakeholders to put in place in the short term an appropriately structured payment system for micro-generated electricity exported to the grid, which will operate separately from the REFIT mechanism.SEI is also implementing a Micro-generation Pilot Programme, involving research and field trials, including support for between 50 and 60 installations on a pilot basis of micro-scale projects.  The field trials will address a range of issues including grid connection and technical standards to ensure the power security, safety and quality of installations.The CER and ESB Networks have amended the rules for the connection of micro-scale plants to the grid.   Generators of less than 6kW on single phase cables and 11kW on three phase electricity supply cables may now connect to the grid without prior authorisation.The rollout of a national smart meter programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Meter programme is a central component of the strategy to significantly enhance management of energy demand and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.  Testing the capability of advanced meters to distinguish between the import and export of electricity will also form a key part of the technology trial.  This will facilitate the development of micro-generation where consumers generate their own electricity and sell their surplus back to the grid.Following these changes, SEI is publishing a guide to connecting renewable and CHP electricity production plants to the electricity network.  This includes advice for micro-generators, which will be of assistance to those connecting micro scale plant to the network.In addition, revised planning guidelines from my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, establishes an exemption from planning consent requirements for domestic-scale projects of suitable heights.Following completion of the work to which I have referred, I expect to announce the detailed arrangements, including the proposed payment system for micro-scale projects in the coming weeks.

In association with the Minister for Transport, I announced targets last year for the deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland.  We have set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which will represent up to 250,000 cars on Irish roads over the next 12 years.  A number of initiatives to advance our policy in this area have already been put in place.  The Minister for Finance has provided a new tax incentive for businesses to purchase electric vehicles in the 2009 Finance Act.  This enables businesses to write off 100% of the cost of purchase against tax under the Accelerated Capital Allowance Scheme.  SEI is also developing a €1 million project on alternative transport technologies including electric vehicles.I have established an inter-departmental agency taskforce to progress the framework for deployment of electric vehicles in Ireland chained by my Department.  The first meeting of the taskforce was held in October 2008 and it has met on a number of occasions.  All relevant Departments, including the Department of Transport, are members of the taskforce.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI), ESB, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland and other stakeholders and agencies are also represented on the taskforce.The ESB and SEI have been working intensively within the taskforce and visited Israel and Denmark last year to learn from their approaches to fast tracking the deployment of electric vehicles.The taskforce is assessing the infrastructure options for the national roll-out of electric vehicles.  The Government is sending out the message that Ireland is open for business in this area and we will also take account of global developments as the technologies mature.  The taskforce will report its initial findings and advise on next steps in the next few months.I am determined that the targets we have set in this area will be achieved.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	448	The Deputy is referring to Figure 3.39 titled "Fastest ADSL Business Download Speed Available by the Incumbent and Annual Cost, October 2008", which was printed in the "Annual Competitiveness Report 2008", published jointly by the National Competitiveness Council and Forfás.This is a very specific business broadband product available only from incumbents in the countries included in the survey for this particular figure in the report.  It would be inaccurate to suggest that Ireland's ranking for this particular product is representative of broadband costs and speeds.I understand the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, which publishes a detailed quarterly report on the electronic communications market, will be meeting with Forfás and the National Competitiveness Council to outline the importance of broader, more relevant analysis and reporting of broadband speeds and costs.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 60% of Irish households now have a broadband connection.  ComReg's quarterly report for Q3 2008 states that 61.1% of those households have a connection in the speed category of 2mbps — 10mbps.  At the end of Q1 2008, 83% of Irish SMEs had a broadband connection.  Most of those SMEs, 72.6%, according to ComReg's report for Q3 2008, have a connection in the speed category of 2mbps — 10mbps.As regards the cost of broadband, it is important to note that ComReg, in its last quarterly report (issued for Q3 2008), ranked Ireland in 8th place in the "DSL and Cable basket" used for international comparison purposes and compared favourably with the EU24 average.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 98, 108, 112 and 123 together.The regulation of ESB customer supply electricity tariffs and BGÉ gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim) Regulation Act 2002.I welcome the fact that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) announced on 1 December 2008 that there would be no further increase in the price of gas from January 2009 and that there would be a small average decrease from that month of just less than 1% in the price of electricity supplied by ESB Customer Supply.  This decision is reflective of recent easing in international fossil fuel prices, which follows a period of exponential increases in global oil, gas and coal prices.I also welcome the substantial rebate of about €400m provided by ESB to all electricity customers, irrespective of which supplier, which has helped to stabilise electricity prices for 2009.The CER made the decision to end tariff regulation for large electricity users in September 2006.  It concluded that there is a sufficient level of generation capacity in the upper end of the market to allow customers to receive offers of a competitively priced supply of electricity.  As a result, the vast majority of large industrial and commercial electricity customers are currently supplied by independent suppliers and companies and are free to negotiate alternative supply offers with the alternative suppliers in the marketplace.  Many of these large industrial consumers are on fuel variation tariffs and have experienced the benefits of falling gas prices in recent months.The legislation is not prescriptive in terms of the methodology to be used by the CER in reaching its decisions on regulating residential and small business customers.  The legislation does not preclude the regulator from reviewing prices more frequently nor does it preclude the regulator from adopting alternative approaches.The CER is required to examine the costs underlying the regulated tariffs to ensure they are cost reflective and to make decisions, which do not disturb the market through a review of tariffs.  I have asked CER to undertake an immediate review of options to bring forward a reduction in electricity prices.  As I stated in this House last week, if current trends in energy prices, particularly gas continue, I would expect a double-digit cut in electricity and gas this year.Encouraging a competitive energy supply is a key policy objective for the Government.  Rising energy costs are a major concern for all sectors of the economy and for consumers.  It is a major concern for the European Union and globally.In this context, I welcome the National Competitiveness Council's investigation into electricity prices.  This report, along with other recently published research, provides a valuable insight into the drivers of higher energy costs in our market.  In particular, they underline the imperative to reduce Ireland's dependence on imported fossil fuels and our exposure to volatile international market prices for these commodities.The Government's Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government set out the actions being taken to deliver security, sustainability and competitiveness of energy supply.  We will promote energy efficiency, deliver on our ambitious renewable targets and progress vital strategic energy infrastructure such as the East West Electricity Interconnector.Much needed long overdue investment in energy infrastructure contributes to the cost of energy.  The provision of this infrastructure to schedule and at least cost will however, deliver secure, sustainable, competitive and cost efficient electricity and gas supplies for the benefit of Irish business and consumers.In relation to oil prices the Government does not control, or seek to control prices at the petrol pump.  The National Consumer Agency recently undertook an investigation into diesel and petrol price movements in Ireland.  This report concluded that there is little evidence to suggest unwarranted delays in the passing on of wholesale price changes to the consumer at the pump.  My Department is reviewing the methodology for collecting oil price statistics in Ireland with a view to ensuring this information is fully reflective of current market conditions, taking into account significant changes in the structure of the oil market in recent years.  The EU is also reviewing price collection data across EU Member States to ensure greater consistency and transparency of published oil price data.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	450	Planning for the rollout of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) services in Ireland is the shared responsibility of RTÉ, Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), ComReg and my own Department.The Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 2007, provides for the development of DTT in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.  Under this Act, RTÉ is required to provide a national DTT system with capacity to carry RTÉ, TG4 and TV3.  This new service will replace the existing analogue free to air television service.The legislation also requires the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) to seek commercial applicants who are interested in providing commercial DTT services.  The BCI ran a competition for three national DTT multiplex contracts in March 2008.Arising from this competition, the BCI is currently in the process of negotiating a contract with Boxer (DTT) Limited, in relation to the development of DTT services in Ireland.RTÉ is building out a national DTT network and has indicated that it is on target to launch services to 85% of the population — including the South East of Ireland, in autumn 2009.RTÉ is also in the process of negotiating a contract for carriage of Boxer's DTT services on its DTT network.Wales is set to switch off its analogue television services in autumn 2009.  This is likely to impact viewers along the South East of the country who currently receive overspill of the UK television signals.  Viewers on cable and satellite will not be affected.Both RTÉ and the BCI are aware of the situation in Wales and of the importance of providing DTT along the South East of Ireland, as a matter of priority.  Depending on the DTT package available, persons who subscribe to commercial DTT services should be able to receive UK television channels currently available via analogue overspill.

These reviews have traditionally examined RTÉ's performance against its published Statement of Commitments.  The recommendations arising out of these reviews have aided Government's decisions in relation to any adjustments to the licence fee.The last independent review was carried out in 2007 in respect of RTÉ's 2006 performance. My Department is currently reviewing RTE's 2007 performance and the outcome of this review will inform any decision in relation to the licence fee.

The mobile broadband service will be delivered using Internet High Speed Packet Access (I-HSPA) technology and will cover up to 95% of the NBS coverage area.  The service will have a minimum upload speed of 200kpbs.  The 200kpbs product is the minimum speed available and is comparable to what is typically used by residential broadband users in urban areas.  Additionally, the service will have a minimum download speed of 1.2mbps, a maximum contention ratio of 36:1, a latency of 120 milliseconds and a 15 gigabit (12 down, 3 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.Businesses currently without any broadband service will benefit by being able to send and receive emails and files, surf the web, and update their own websites.  Under the NBS contract the broadband products will be upgraded to higher specifications (speeds, contention and data caps) in July 2010 and again in October 2012 without any increase in the monthly recurring charge.  NBS subscribers will experience minimum download speeds of 1.6Mbps and 2.3Mbps and minimum upload speeds of 1.2Mbps and 1.4Mbps subsequent to these upgrades in 2010 and 2012 respectively.In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very difficult to reach using standard infrastructure, 3 will make available a satellite product which is expected to cover around 5% of the NBS areas.  The satellite product will have a minimum download speed of 1mbps, a minimum upload speed of 128kbps, a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, latency of 800 milliseconds and an 11 gigabit (10 down, 1 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.I am satisfied that the NBS will provide speeds comparable with products available in the market for urban areas and greatly assist in bridging the digital divide.

It was established in November last following Government approval.  The forum is chaired by Mr Joe Brosnan, a former Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.The Forum has, as its objectives, to further the socio-economic development of the North West Mayo Region and to provide an opportunity for dialogue between parties with an interest in the Corrib Gas project.  The Forum will also help promote an understanding of how the project is regulated by providing an opportunity for a coordinated engagement with the Government Departments and other State bodies that have a regulatory role in relation to the Corrib Gas Project.Membership of the Forum is comprised of representatives of a wide range of local groups; elected public representatives; Government Departments, State bodies and Shell E&P Ireland Limited.  A number of local groups opposed to the current configuration of the gas project have so far declined to participate in the Forum.The Forum has met on two occasions.  These meetings on 5 December 2008 and 2 February 2009 allowed discussion and debate on a range of issues as follows: the detail of the statutory consents that are in place in relation to the Corrib Gas Project; and development opportunities in North West Mayo, including potential energy related projects.Thus far the Forum has, I believe proven to be a useful vehicle for engagement on issues of relevance to the project and the region.

EirGrid, as the National Transmission System Operator, will procure the construction of the interconnector, at the Government's request.I welcome the Commission's recognition of the strategic importance of the East West interconnector in its proposals.  Negotiations in Brussels are ongoing on the Commission's overall proposals, which have implications for the EU Budget.  In that context I will be working with the Minister for Finance and other Ministerial colleagues to ensure the best outcome for Ireland on the overall package.Delivery to schedule of the East-West Electricity Interconnector is a key Government priority.  The interconnector will underpin regional energy market development and the all-island Single Electricity Market.  It will ensure that Ireland can benefit from the development of a strong internal energy market in Europe.East West interconnection will also give Ireland direct and secure access to the UK energy market and onwards also to the EU mainland markets.  This will increase Ireland's security of electricity supply and enhance the competitive energy market.  Over time the interconnector should exert downward pressure on prices in the all-island electricity market.The Government has set the ambitious target of 40% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020. The East West Interconnector will support the increased penetration of renewable generation, particularly wind generation in the Irish market.  It will offer opportunities for export of Irish wind generated electricity.

This represents about 23% of total EU consumption.Ireland's demand for gas is met almost entirely by imports from the UK with declining production and storage at Kinsale, now supplying around 4%, accounting for the remainder.  Irish imports account for around 5% of the UK gas market.  The vast bulk of UK gas demand is currently being met by indigenous North Sea production and imports from Norway.  The UK is also interconnected with continental Europe and receives some gas from Russia.  I understand this would account for less than 2 % of the gas in the UK system. As a result, Ireland experienced no adverse impact on our gas supplies as a result of the recent Russia/Ukraine dispute.Ireland participated fully in the discussions required for the EU evaluation and response to the recent Russia/Ukraine gas dispute.  We consistently supported the EU position, as voiced by President Barosso, that the actions of the parties who are involved in contractually supplying gas to the EU have been unacceptable and that the interests of the EU in dealing with all third countries can only be served by all Member States speaking with one voice.  To this end, Ireland has also voiced support on a number of occasions for the call by the European Commission for increased transparency in the sharing of data on gas metrics in the EU in order to provide a strong basis for solidarity arrangements to be developed.The development of an EU energy emergency response mechanism, and robust arrangements for solidarity between Member States in the event of an energy emergency, will remain very high on the EU agenda for the foreseeable future.  It is critical that, as part of its energy policy and to complement the proper functioning of the internal energy market, the EU develops the capability to respond effectively to energy disruptions and provide support for Member States affected by such events.  Ireland — as one of the most peripheral energy markets in the EU — will participate fully in this work.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 489 together.The rollout of a national smart meter programme is progressing in line with the commitment in the Government's Energy Policy Framework and in the Programme for Government.  The Smart Meter programme is a central component of the strategy to significantly enhance management of energy demand and to achieve greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.The pilot phase is a very important element in the determination of a decision to proceed with the launch of a national smart meter scheme.  This is a highly complex technological project and the trials are essential to ensure that we have the right technology and systems for the full launch and implementation of a national smart meter scheme.The pilot phase, for both electricity and gas, was launched on 15 September 2008.  The results of the pilot will inform both the timing of a national roll out, and the technology to be adopted. It is important to have a trial that captures seasonal changes in usage for peak demand management purposes. The pilot phase is expected to be completed at end December 2010 and the outcome should be a fully informed decision on the most suitable model of smart meter(s)/IT system(s), tariffing structure, communications system and demand stimuli, all of which works effectively and has the capability to deliver the anticipated benefits of smart metering in the Irish market.The pilot phase encompasses two strands — a technology trial, which is testing a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure — and a customer behaviour trial, which will determine the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.The technology trial will examine meter functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  There are many challenges involved in developing a metering system for Ireland that will reflect the dispersed nature of our population and, as a result, by extension, the electricity network.  This trial will involve the installation of up to 10,000 meters.Testing the capability of advanced meters to distinguish between the import and export of electricity will also form a key part of the technology trial.  This will facilitate the development of microgeneration where consumers generate their own electricity and sell their surplus back to the grid.Participants for the customer behaviour trial are being selected to ensure that the sample is representative of Ireland's electricity consumers both in terms of usage profiles and geographical spread.  Invitations to participate in the trial are being issued on a phased basis with 8000 letters of invitation issued thus far.  To date the response has been very positive with 37% of electricity customers contacted expressing an interest in participating.  The number of participants needed for the electricity customer behaviour trial is 6,000. Installation of electricity meters for this strand of the pilot phase is under way and is expected to be completed by mid 2009.The participation of gas customers into the pilot phase is being progressed, with the procurement process for gas smart meters now underway. This should allow for the completion of the installation of meters for the gas element of the pilot phase before the end of 2009.For the purposes of the pilot phase 4 models of electricity smart meter are being trialled. The specifications of these metering systems will allow the testing of a range of functions, including, interval metering reading, time of use tariffing and the use of In Home Display devices, which, in turn, can facilitate demand management and increased energy efficiency. They will also provide data on actual energy use of an amount and quality necessary to drive improvements in service to consumers through better fault monitoring and outage recording, power quality monitoring, reduced theft and losses and improved network planning.  In addition, as highlighted above, the capacity of these smart metering systems to distinguish between the import and export of electricity will facilitate the development of microgeneration.As part of the preparation for the ‘go live' of the pilot, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) is near completion of its review of submissions from ESB Networks, ESB Customer Supply, Sustainable Energy Ireland, Bord Gáis Networks and industry participants, on the budget for the entire pilot phase. I expect to receive confirmation of the finalised budget of the pilot phase from the CER in the coming weeks.The cost of a national rollout will be quantified when the pilot phase has been completed.

The mobile broadband service will be delivered using Internet High Speed Packet Access (I-HSPA) technology and will cover up to 95% of the NBS coverage area.  The service will have a minimum upload speed of 200kpbs.  The 200kpbs product is the minimum speed available and is comparable to what is typically used by residential broadband users in urban areas.  Additionally, the service will have a minimum download speed of 1.2mbps, a maximum contention ratio of 36:1, a latency of 120 milliseconds and a 15 gigabit (12 down, 3 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.Businesses currently without any broadband service will benefit by being able to send and receive emails and files, surf the web, and update their own websites.  Under the NBS contract the broadband products will be upgraded to higher specifications (speeds, contention and data caps) in July 2010 and again in October 2012 without any increase in the monthly recurring charge.In recognition of the fact that some areas will be very difficult to reach using standard infrastructure, 3 will make available a satellite product which is expected to cover around 5% of the NBS areas.  The satellite product will have a minimum download speed of 1mbps, a minimum upload speed of 128kbps, a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, latency of 800 milliseconds and an 11 gigabit (10 down, 1 up) inclusive monthly allowance limit.I am satisfied that the NBS will provide speeds comparable with products available in the market for urban areas and greatly assist in bridging the digital divide.As regards the accuracy of the mapping undertaken for the scheme, a comprehensive mapping process has been undertaken.  The process involves:contacting service providers for details of their broadband coverage;inserting service provider data on a broadband coverage map using specialist expertise and software;consulting with Regional Authorities to request that they confirm, as far as was possible, the broadband coverage information provided in the maps;requesting from the Regional Authorities information on any other service providers excluded from the mapping process; andcontacting additional service providers identified by the Regional Authorities and including their coverage on the map.The resulting broadband coverage led to the creation of the map which was updated during the procurement process as appropriate, in consultation with the service providers.  I am satisfied that all reasonable steps have been taken to maximise the accuracy of the map.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	459	The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 60% of Irish households now have a broadband connection.  ComReg's quarterly report for Q3 2008 states that 61.1% of those households have a connection in the speed category of 2mbps — 10mbps.  It is also encouraging that, at the end of Q1 2008, 83% of Irish SMEs had a broadband connection.  Over 70% of those SMEs, according to ComReg's report for Q3 2008, have a connection in the speed category of 2mbps — 10mbps.Following the conclusion of a technology neutral procurement process, which was open to all broadband service providers from across all platforms, my Department has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas that are already substantially served by broadband.  While recognising that some premises within substantially served areas may have difficulties for a variety of reasons (including long lines, pair gains, no line of sight etc.) in receiving a broadband service, the NBS cannot cater for such limited instances as to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  It is therefore a matter for service providers in an area to address, where possible, such instances of non access to broadband.Ireland's energy policy framework identifies energy efficiency as the most cost effective means of reducing our dependence on imported energy, as well as mitigating harmful green house gas emissions. Government has set a target of 20% energy efficiency by 2020 and, recognising that the public sector must act as exemplars in the field of energy usage, has set a more stretching target of 33% energy efficiency, for the public sector, by 2020.I previously indicated to the House that I anticipated publishing the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan prior to Christmas but finalisation of the Plan has taken somewhat longer than I then anticipated.  Inter-Departmental consultation is nearing completion on the issue and, after Government approval, I expect to publish the Plan within weeks.  In the interim I would draw the Deputy's attention to the important announcement on grant aid for home insulation measures, which I made on Sunday, 8th February.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 118 together.The improvement of energy efficiency in the housing stock is internationally recognised as one of the most cost effective ways of reducing emissions and energy bills.  Energy efficiency measures to tackle deficiencies in households also support and strengthen employment in the construction and energy services sectors.I launched the national Home Energy Savings Scheme on Sunday last with a budget of €50 million in 2009.  This is expected to support the upgrade of at least 27,500 homes and with other building insulation programmes in my own Department and the Department for the Environment will contribute to the creation of 4,000 direct and indirect jobs.Experience from the pilot phase of the Home Energy Saving Scheme in 2008 has demonstrated that there is considerable demand for a support scheme for energy efficiency measures, not only among householders, but also among building energy rating assessors, product manufacturers, installers and other market players.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) estimates that demand among householders across the country could well exceed 100,000 homes over the lifetime of the scheme.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 on their energy bills if they implement the full suite of measures being proposed under the national scheme.This Scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, varying depending on the measure concerned.  Owners of homes built prior to 2006 can now contact SEI on 1850 927000 or hes@sei.ie to register their interest in this scheme.

The programme will assess technical, financial and regulatory issues surrounding the deployment of small and microgeneration technologies in Ireland and will provide grant aid for around 50 pilot installations.The initiation of the pilot trial of micro- and small-scale generation technologies that will lead to successful implementation of good quality projects yielding meaningful information in a short timeframe is a priority action in the microgeneration programme.The pilot field trial will investigate and test technical, market and regulatory issues associated with their installation, network connection and operation and generation.An associated primary objective is to assess measures required for supplier and product qualification to minimise the risk of adverse outcomes at small-scale and microgeneration installations, hence promoting the robust growth of a microgeneration supply base.  In the absence of relevant European Standards for technologies or robust qualifications for installers, interim arrangements will be put in place for the pilot.A call for expression of interest is currently open for the Low Carbon Housing Programme administered by SEI.  In addition to having a minimum requirement of a Building Energy Rating of A2 or higher the targets also include provision for onsite generation.The Revised Building Regulations brought into force in July 2008 now include a compulsory renewable energy component for all new houses.  This will not only ensure that renewables are integrated into the housing stock but will also encourage individuals to consider a range of renewable options when purchasing a new home.  This is further underpinned by the introduction of the Building Energy Rating which provides information to house purchasers on energy performance and to which renewables will contribute.The Government's Greener Homes Scheme, administered by SEI, provides support to individuals wishing to install renewable energy heating technologies in their homes.  This scheme, now in operation since early 2006, has already helped establish a very strong supply industry for renewable energy products, services and fuels while the application of strict product standards and installer training and quality schemes has ensured that consumers are informed in relation to their choices.

The schemes were designed as interim measures to accelerate the level of biofuels in the fuel mix, in advance of the introduction of a biofuels obligation.  Biofuels are already being mainstreamed in blends of up to 5% at a number of existing petrol and diesel pumps, and higher blends are being sold to identified vehicle fleets.  Given the fact that bioethanol is the generally approved replacement for petrol, it has a valuable role to play in national bioenergy policy.The information sought by the Deputy in relation to imported biofuels is not available.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners advises that the total cost of these excise relief schemes to date is estimated at €40m.  I am committed to the development of an Irish biofuels industry and to the sustainable development and deployment of indigenous bioenergy resources.In relation to licensing of biofuel companies, I have no function on this matter. Consents for the construction of a Biofuel production facility would obviously be required from a number of sources, such as the local authority and possibly the Environmental Protection Agency (depending on the feedstock), while in due course, compliance with the EU Sustainability Criteria will become a condition of biofuels being counted towards EU targets.The planned introduction of a Biofuels Obligation will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The biofuels obligation is designed to provide a long-term market based framework for the development of a biofuels sector and delivery of biofuels targets to 2020.The public consultation process in relation to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme has recently been completed and there were 40 submissions received as part of the consultation process.  My Department is now analysing the submissions with a view to preparing specific details for a final Biofuels Obligation Scheme which will be cognisant of the views expressed by stakeholders.  I will bring a proposal to Government soon and introduce the necessary legislation required in order that the Biofuels Obligation Scheme can be introduced in January 2010.Through the full application of the EU sustainability criteria, the Biofuels Obligation Scheme mechanism will allow us to ensure that the biofuel we use is sustainably sourced, and evolving technologies will allow us to increase the penetration rate without any impacts on food prices.  Given that biofuels will form an increasingly important component of European transport fuels in the coming years, it is vital that these criteria are not alone robust and effective in protecting those most at risk in the developing world, but that they also set the agenda for further investment in more efficient biofuel production, and for investment in second generation biofuels.Through appropriate RD&D schemes such as the Charles Parsons awards, we are incentivising the development of second generation biofuels, which will not use food stocks as raw material input.  Work is currently underway to determine what the marine environment might contribute to developing the national biofuels capacity.  The analysis will include identifying the necessary research, development and demonstration projects to realise any such potential. Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) is commissioning analysis of the potential of marine algae as a source of biofuels for Ireland and my Department is also supporting the Interreg project "Biomara", which will be examining all potential opportunities for biofuel production from marine sources.  This work will provide a comprehensive basis on which to inform research and development work on the potential use of marine algae for renewable energy.  It will also provide data in relation to the biofuels capacity that could potentially be derived from the marine environment.

It is EirGrid's role, as the transmission system operator, to develop and upgrade the transmission system in order to meet ongoing and future electricity needs.The two 400 kV transmission line projects from Meath to Cavan and Cavan to Tyrone are vitally important to the North East region for security of supply, regional and national economic development and the integration of renewable electricity on to the Grid.  I am aware of concern in local communities about the impact of overhead lines, and I was happy to be able to facilitate a meeting with North East Pylon Pressure, which was attended by EirGrid.  The meeting was held on 16 January and all parties engaged in an active and constructive discussion on practical issues relating to the projects and ongoing consultations.  The meeting resulted in a series of agreed action points, including an intensification of the engagement between EirGrid and North East Pylon Pressure on the issues of concern.As regards the issue of underground cables and overhead lines, EirGrid has undertaken to publish a detailed report, which it has commissioned jointly with Northern Ireland Electricity, in relation to undergrounding for the Meath Cavan and Cavan Tyrone projects.  While the independent Ecofys Study provided a generic analysis of underground/overhead transmission infrastructure issues, this report will provide a detailed, site specific analysis of undergrounding issues relating to the entire route for both projects. The report, which has been prepared over a long timescale, will form part of the documentation that will be submitted to An Bord Pleanála as part of EirGrid's planning application for the two projects.  The report will be published in the coming weeks and a period of consultation by EirGrid on its findings will follow.I understand that EirGrid has also agreed to facilitate a meeting between North East Pylon Pressure's consultants (Askon) and EirGrid's own technical experts, and will fund the costs of Askon attending the meeting.  I would hope that this level of engagement between EirGrid and North East Pylon Pressure will assist greatly in resolving issues of concern and moving the projects forward.EirGrid have stressed that consultations will continue with stakeholders over the coming months, until such time as planning consent application is submitted to An Bord Pleanála, which is the Statutory Planning Authority in relation to strategic infrastructure projects.

Section 114 of the Bill provides that one of the principle objects of RTÉ is "to establish, maintain and operate a national television and sound broadcasting service, which shall have the character of a public service, be a free-to-air service and be made available, in so far as it is reasonably practicable, to the whole community on the island of Ireland".The first phase of DTT services will launch in autumn this year with coverage of about 85% of the country.  The analogue network will continue to operate alongside the new digital network for a transition period until an analogue switch off date is reached.  Information on the development of this network is available from RTÉ's own website, www.rte.ie.My Department is working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and our UK counterparts to coordinate a smooth transition from analogue to digital services in both jurisdictions.Analogue switch off is currently planned for end 2012 in Northern Ireland, which is the target EU analogue switch-off date.  I am confident that Ireland can meet that target and that RTÉ, by way of DTT technology, will continue to be available in Northern Ireland.

The project involves an integrated and systematic ex-post assessment of the energy, environmental, thermal comfort and health benefits of the SEI-administered Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), which retrofits low income private homes with insulation and other energy saving measures.  The report of the Fuel Poverty Research Project is due to be published for consultation at the end of March 2009 following a presentation to the interdepartmental working group on energy affordability.The Warmer Homes Scheme provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty and is delivered by community based organisations (CBOs).  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and St Vincent De Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable consumers from the impact of high energy costs through a combination of institutional supports and investment in improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock.  I am working closely with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to deliver a fully cohesive approach across Government.I established last year, an Inter Departmental/Agency Group led by my Department and the Department for Social and Family Affairs, and which also includes the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, and Health and Children, the Commission for Energy Regulation, SEI, ESB and BGÉ and the Institute of Public Health.  This intensive cooperation and coordinated working by all the relevant Departments, agencies and the utilities is ensuring the effective delivery of a comprehensive approach to addressing energy affordability.  The Group has been conducting a series of meetings with representative groups and agencies including Age Action Ireland and Energy Action in addition to relevant groups and agencies in Northern Ireland.The Group has finalised an advisory booklet to inform and assist those seeking advice about supports in relation to energy affordability.  The booklet will be published this month alongside a new complementary website and will be widely disseminated.To date more than 20,000 homes have been substantially addressed by the Warmer Homes Scheme.  In 2009 there is €20 million available to the WHS with a further 15,000 homes expected to be completed.  SEI, in consultation with ESB, BGÉ and other stakeholders, is reviewing the operation of the Scheme with the aim of ensuring that maximum impact is delivered from the enhanced funding.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The role of the Government in the electronic communications market in Ireland is to formulate policy to facilitate the provision of high quality services by competing service providers.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 60% of Irish households now have a broadband connection.  ComReg's quarterly report for Q3 2008 states that 61.1% of those households have a connection in the speed category of 2mbps — 10mbps.  At the end of Q1 2008, 83% of Irish SMEs had a broadband connection.  Most of those SMEs, 72.6%, according to ComReg's report for Q3 2008, have a connection in the speed category of 2mbps — 10mbps.The latest OECD report, which includes data up to June 2008 is also testament to the considerable improvement of recent years.  It shows that Ireland had the fourth strongest per capita broadband subscription growth of the 30 countries ranked.  With similar fast uptake of broadband noted in previous reports, Ireland has closed the gap on the OECD average with our improvement over the past 2 years.  Additionally, it should be noted that mobile broadband, which is very popular with Irish broadband subscribers, is not yet published for the purposes of international statistical comparisons.  However, mobile broadband statistics are expected to be published by the OECD in the future reports.  The publication of mobile broadband statistics is expected to improve Ireland's ranking further.There are still some parts of the country where the private sector cannot justify the commercial provision of broadband services. Accordingly, my Department has undertaken to implement the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  Services will begin to be rolled out in April 2009 and the entire NBS area will be served by September 2010.Internationally, electronic communications markets are moving to provide next generation broadband in order to deliver greater quality, speed and service to consumers.  This is happening where there is strong competition and incentives to innovate. The policy framework for future broadband development in Ireland is set out in the consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband, which I published last July.  The consultation period on the paper has now concluded and I will publish the final policy paper shortly.I am also actively engaged with the EU Commission's review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications.  Effective regulation, and more consistency in regulatory approaches across all the Member States, will enhance the conditions necessary for investment in communications technology and allow Ireland exploit the opportunities such technology brings for the benefit of our economy and society.

These include the Renewable Energy Research Development and Demonstration programme, which provides grant support for the development of new renewable energy technologies, including the development of advanced biomass energy systems.  Individuals or companies can contact SEI and apply for support under this scheme.SEI also operates a number of other support schemes for the commercial deployment of biomass heating systems, for the domestic user.  SEI operates the Greener Homes Scheme, which provides fixed grant support for biomass boilers.  At the commercial level, SEI operates the Renewable Energy Heating scheme, which provides 30% grant support for  boilers up to 1 Mega Watt in size.  Boilers at a size larger than this also qualify for grant support with a slightly reduced rate.  Both programmes are designed to stimulate the deployment of renewable energy heating in Ireland and will assist in achieving the target of delivering 12% of heat from renewable energy sources by 2020.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	471	There is currently no requirement under EU legislation for Ireland to hold strategic reserves of natural gas i.e. reserves that could not be accessed under normal market conditions, as is the case with oil under IEA obligations.  Recent European Commission analysis, undertaken as part of the Second EU Strategic Energy Review, shows that the cost of strategic gas storage is very high, at 5 times that of oil storage.  The potential for gas storage facilities is also dependent on geological conditions.  Therefore depleted gas fields (such as is the case with the storage facility at Kinsale) are often good options for storage.  This also means that some countries do not have the potential to store gas.  For these reasons the European Commission has indicated it will not impose EU obligations regarding strategic gas stocks.The existing commercial gas storage facility at Kinsale has the capacity to hold 198 million cubic metres, licensed for use by Bord Gáis Éireann, which could supply around 50% of residential and SME gas needs for up to 50 days in the event of a disruption to our gas imports.While the prognosis for the security of our gas supplies is relatively secure in light of the stability of the UK gas market, it is nevertheless prudent, in light of our dependence on gas imported from the UK, to seek to reduce our reliance on this source.  In this regard, the question of gas storage, including Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), is being considered on an All Island basis.  My Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, and energy Regulators North and South, to examine the medium to long term position with regard to security of gas supply on the Island of Ireland.In addition, there is interest in providing further gas storage on a commercial basis. Shannon LNG — a wholly owned subsidiary of the US firm Hess LNG — proposes to construct an LNG re-gasification terminal at a site located on the Shannon Estuary between Tarbert and Ballylongford in County Kerry.  The project, which could potentially provide up to 40% of Ireland's gas requirements, is being planned on a "merchant" basis.  This means that the project is private sector development which would be run on a commercial basis.  LNG has the potential to improve connectivity to the global gas market, which would be a critical factor in the event of a major supply disruption.However, any discussion of this issue clearly underlines the strategic importance of diversifying our sources of gas supply — not least indigenous production — including the importance of bringing the Corrib Gas field into production.  At full production this field is estimated to meet 60% of our annual demand for gas for circa five years.

While Ireland is supportive of the proposal, other Member States are opposed and a proposal has not, as yet, been agreed between the Commission and all Member States.In the event that the proposal is agreed, any funding available to Member States would be distributed under the Rural Development Fund administered in Ireland by the Department of Agriculture and Food.  Officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food and my officials have proposed possible initiatives to the EU Commission that could be considered for inclusion in the proposal should it be agreed.  These include an initiative to help residences and businesses not covered by the national broadband scheme and which are unable to access broadband.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The Power of One campaign aims to bring about more energy efficient behaviour by domestic consumers and other energy using sectors to achieve energy and CO2 savings.  The campaign has been operating since August 2006 and has brought about a significant increase in awareness of energy efficiency and best practice energy behaviour.  Since the beginning of 2009, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has assumed responsibility for the campaign.  This is likely to see the campaign evolve in different directions, though the website will continue to be an important information hub.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is responsible for the Change campaign.  The objective of the campaign is to raise public awareness of climate change, its causes, impacts and implications for Ireland, as well as to drive significant behavioural change to reduce and avoid greenhouse gas emissions in how we live, work and travel.  The remit of the campaign covers the broad spectrum of transport, waste, water, energy, biodiversity and planning across the sectors agriculture, transport, construction, tourism, business, industry and the public sector. The campaign includes a significant advertising element as well as extensive stakeholder engagement to develop specific programmes and web-based tools tailored to achieve emission reductions at sectoral level.Since the inception of the Change campaign, there has been a high degree of coordination and cooperation between the two campaigns in relation to energy efficiency and carbon reduction.  This has involved sharing of materials, co-funding of projects and many linkages between the websites of the two campaigns.  This approach has led to significant savings for the Exchequer.I believe this cooperative approach should continue.  My Department and SEI are both represented on the inter-Departmental steering committee for the Change campaign.  In respect of Power of One, I have asked SEI to actively pursue the scope for continuing and enhancing cooperation between the campaigns as part of their management of Power of One.

Referrals from public health nurses, community services and St Vincent De Paul are also accepted.In 2007, there were approximately 270,000 households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment.  Of these, approximately two thirds are in private housing and are eligible for the WHS.  However, applicability is also dependent on the energy efficiency standard of the applicant's home and not all fuel allowance recipients' homes are in need of the WHS energy efficiency improvements.To date, more than 20,000 homes have been substantially addressed by the WHS.  In 2009 there is €20 million available to the WHS with a further 15,000 homes expected to be completed.  The number of applicants on the WHS waiting list is 4,618 homes, which are registered with the 20 community based organisations currently delivering the WHS.The 20 community based organisations represent coverage of just over two-thirds of the country.  A number of additional community based organisations will be required to deliver nationwide coverage.  It is planned to commence the introduction of new organisations from the end of March this year.A number of improvements to the WHS will be introduced over the coming weeks, including a new free phone service designed to assist householders identify their nearest provider.  If outside of current coverage, their details will be recorded and notified as soon as the service becomes available in their area.  In addition, a new website will be launched to allow homeowners, neighbours or relatives find out more information about the WHS and other grant schemes available in their area.The total spend on the WHS in 2008 was €5.6M, which represented a doubling of the previous years allocation.

The relevant service providers operate in a fully liberalised market.Accordingly, I have not issued directives or instructions to ComReg or the mobile phone operators regarding the matters raised by the Deputies nor do I intend to do so.The most recent Single Telecoms Market Progress Report published in 2008 describes Ireland's mobile market as diverse, competitive and advanced.  In addition, recent surveys conducted by ComReg indicate that the majority of Irish people are content with existing broadband speeds and the value for money of their Internet service.ComReg sets out the obligations on mobile network operators with regard to population coverage.  These obligations are set down in the licence conditions for each operator.  According to ComReg all four mobile network operators have complied with these targets to date.  In addition they have invested significantly in their networks.

The REFIT programme imposes qualifying conditions and timelines for the completion of projects. In December last the Commission for Energy Regulation published a decision on Gate 3 connection requests which includes a number of offshore wind-powered projects.  I am now awaiting comments from key stakeholders on the appropriate timelines within the REFIT programme, to apply to the offshore wind energy category.  These timelines must reflect the timelines for the delivery of connections to offshore projects notified to project developers in the first instance.I also announced in 2008, an Ocean Energy Strategy to harness emerging wave and tidal powered technologies, which are moving from the research phase to prototype deployment, within a three year cycle.  The Ocean Energy Development Unit has been established within Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to manage the ocean energy package.  I am pleased to confirm that all components of the package are now under way and are being progressed by SEI.

Under this Act, RTÉ is required to provide a DTT system with capacity to carry RTÉ, TG4 and TV3.  The legislation also requires the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) to seek commercial applicants who are interested in providing commercial DTT services.RTÉ has started to build a DTT network in Ireland and has indicated that services will be launched on a phased basis starting in autumn 2009.  It is expected that the first phase of DTT services will provide coverage of about 85% of the country.  Information on the development of this network is available from RTÉ's website, www.rte.ieThe BCI is responsible for the development of commercial DTT services and is currently in contract negotiations with a company, Boxer (DTT) Limited, in this regard.I am confident that Ireland can meet the target EU analogue switch-off date of 2012.  In the meantime, TV services will be simulcast on both analogue and digital networks so that viewers may choose to switch or to remain on analogue during that period.TV viewers who wish to receive the DTT service will need to upgrade their television receiver equipment either by using a DTT set top box or by purchasing a digital television approved for use on the Irish DTT network.  It is expected that the initial cost of a set top box will be in the region of €50-100.

Civil service posts at the levels of Assistant Secretary and Deputy Secretary are covered by a scheme of performance related awards.  Details of awards to individual officers under the performance related scheme are not disclosed on the basis that they are confidential to the officer concerned.  However, during 2008, awards totalling €62,400 were made to 6 officers in my Department in respect of 2007.  Details of the operation of the scheme are available in the report of the Committee for Performance Awards which can be accessed on the website of the Department of Finance (www.finance.gov.ie).Following the recent announcement by the Minister for Finance relating to the discontinuation of this scheme, there is no specific provision for payment under this scheme for 2009.In addition, a total of €13,648 was paid in 2008 in respect of this Department's Employee Recognition Awards Scheme in respect of exceptional performance in 2007 (€6,816  in individual awards to 6 staff and the remainder in team awards/cross divisional awards)
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	489	The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) has responsibility for developing and maintaining the National Framework of Qualifications.  It is governed by the Qualifications (Education & Training) Act 1999, which stipulates that the NQAI will "promote recognition outside the State of awards made by bodies in the State and recognition in the State of awards made by bodies outside the State".In this context, the NQAI has established a qualifications recognition service, which is the Irish centre for the recognition of international qualifications.  The NQAI represents Ireland in a European network of centres known as ENIC/NARIC (European National Information Centre/National Academic Recognition Information Centre) and is a National Reference Point, which promotes the recognition of international vocational qualifications throughout Europe and further a field, including the United States of America.The role of FÁS, as the National Training & Employment Authority is to enable the State to engage in and support human resource development of the labour force.  Many courses offered by FÁS including apprenticeships, lead to qualifications that are placed on the National Framework of Qualifications.The NQAI is currently undertaking the alignment of the Irish National Framework of Qualifications with European Framework of Qualifications.  When the alignment is complete, it should result in greater transparency and recognition across the EU for all Irish awards, including trade qualifications.Prior to the transfer of its certification powers to FETAC, FÁS negotiated mutual recognition agreements with the UK and Germany for several Irish trades.  FÁS are committed to working proactively with the NQAI with a view to identifying the steps needed to assist tradespeople wishing to have their qualifications recognised abroad.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	490	The General Product Safety Directive 2001/95/EC, transposed into Irish law by S.I. No. 199 of 2004, places the onus on all operators, manufacturers, distributors, importers etc. to ensure that only safe products are placed on the market.  If operators become aware that products on the market present a potential hazard they must take appropriate measures up to and including recall of the items, to ensure that the risk is removed.  Any action taken by an operator must be notified to the Market Surveillance Authority (National Consumer Agency in Ireland).  The Market Surveillance Authority notifies the European Commission of the action through the Rapid Alert Notification System (RAPEX).  The Commission transmits the information to all Member States, with a view to their taking appropriate action to protect the safety of consumers in their country.On 22 December 2008 the European Commission issued a Decision on compliance of Standard EN 1273 of 2005, on baby walkers, with the General Product Safety Directive.  This revised Standard, which has been in place since May 2005, provides for stability tests and design requirements geared to improving safety.  The Commission indicated that the improved safety measures would increase the passive prevention of accidents arising from the use of baby walkers.If operators comply with the safety measures built into the revised Standard, they would be regarded as meeting the safety requirements of the General Product Safety Directive.  In these circumstances there would be no grounds for introducing a ban.  However, if products are found on the European Union market that do not comply with the new safety measures, appropriate action will be taken through the RAPEX system to have these items removed.  There have been 12 RAPEX notifications in Europe since 2005 ordering the removal of certain types of babywalkers from the market.  The NCA have passed on the notifications to operators in Ireland.

The Report and the eleven recommendations contained therein are being considered in the context of the ongoing wider review of the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002.  It is my intention to bring forward legislation during the course of 2009 to reform aspects of competition law, including provisions concerning media mergers, and to implement the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority in accordance with the Government decision on the rationalisaiton of State Agencies as announced by my colleague the Minister for Finance during the course of the Budget speech.

CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.The aim of CE still remains as an active labour market programme with the emphasis on progression into employment.  The programme is managed within this context, with consideration to the availability of resources and the needs of participants and the community.  FÁS makes every effort to ensure that differing levels of demand between neighbouring schemes are equalised.  FÁS also operates the programme flexibly as far as possible to ensure the continuation of community projects.This Government will continue to support the positive role of CE in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.  I am keeping the operation of the Scheme under constant review in the context of the current difficult unemployment situation.

For strategic skills/labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  The various schemes that give effect to such policies were introduced under the Employment Permits Act, 2006.Given that our current employment permit arrangements were designed to be vacancy-driven, the numbers of permit applications and consequent numbers of permits issued over the last six months have been showing a consistent downward trend.I am currently having our employment permit arrangements reviewed to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market.

The Court subsequently invited submissions on the issue. Various submissions were received, including from IBEC, ICTU and the Department of Finance.  The Labour Court also held discussions with these parties.  I understand that the matter is still under consideration by the Court.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	497	There are a number of existing schemes, funded by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which provide a subsidy to a person's wage.  These include employment supports available to persons in receipt of welfare payments that are designed to assist and facilitate people on social welfare payments to return to the active labour force.  Included in these measures is the Back to Work Allowance (BTWA).  The BTWA scheme is designed to assist the long-term unemployed, lone parents, people with disabilities and other social welfare recipients to return to work.  There are two strands to the scheme, the Back to Work Enterprise allowance for the self-employed and the Back to Work Allowance for employees.  These allowances provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependant long-term on social welfare payments to make the return to work financially attractive and viable.Financial support is also available to those who are engaged in short-time employment through the payment of Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance in respect of those days that the person is unemployed.In addition to that outlined above, my Department, through FÁS, funds and operates a Wage Subsidy Scheme that provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ disabled people who work more than 20 hours per week.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	498	The Consumer Protection Act 2007 permits the Government, where they are of the opinion that abnormal circumstances exist in relation to the supply of a product, to make an order declaring that a state of emergency exists affecting the supply of that product and to fix, by way of a further order, the maximum price at which the product may be supplied to consumers.Competition and consumer choice have been the preferred means of successive Governments in the area of tackling prices.  Vigorous competition and strong consumer protection are essential parts in maintaining a vibrant economy.  In so far as current difficulties in the area of north south price differentials are concerned, I have actively engaged with the retail sector over the past number of months to ensure that Irish consumers benefit by way of lower prices from the appreciation in the value of the Euro, particularly against sterling. I am determined to pursue all links in the retail chain including retailers, distributors, suppliers to ensure that there is the greatest transparency in relation to the reasons for the substantial differentials in prices between this jurisdiction and Northern Ireland and the UK.  In this regard, I would wish to assure the Deputy that the Government are committed to exploring all options to ensure that Irish consumers get a fair deal.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The Companies Acts 1963-2006 sets out the requirements in relation to the filing of annual accounts by companies.Filing RequirementsThe Companies Acts require that an annual return be delivered by a company, whether trading or not, to the CRO once at least in every calendar year. Companies are required to attach a copy of their accounts to the annual return.Sanctions for Late Filing or Failure to FileA late filing penalty of €100 becomes due in respect of an annual return on the day after the expiry of the filing deadline, i.e. 28 days after the effective date of the return. A daily penalty amount of €3 accrues thereafter up to a maximum penalty of €1,200 per return. This penalty is in addition to the standard fee for filing the return.A company with a record of persistent late filing may also be subject to an on-the-spot fine and/or summary prosecution of the company and/or any officer in default. Fines of up to €1,904.61 can be imposed on conviction for breach of the annual return filing requirements.The Registrar may prosecute companies and/or directors in the District Court for failure to file annual returns and accounts on behalf of their companies. In addition he may also apply to the High Court for an order directing the filing of outstanding annual returns and accounts within the period specified in the order and he may seek to have all the costs of and incidental to that application, borne by the defaulting company or its officers.A company cannot avail of the exemption from the requirement for a statutory audit if its annual return for the current year or the previous year was not filed on time.Strike-offA company may be struck off the register and dissolved for failure to file an annual return. If a company is struck off, the assets of the company become vested in the Minister for Finance, and if the business continues to trade, the owners will no longer enjoy the benefit of limited liability and so are personally responsible for any debts incurred so long as the company remains dissolved.Any person, who was a director of a company at the date of sending to that company of a strike off notice due to the non-filing of annual returns, may be disqualified from acting as a director by the High Court, where the company is struck off leaving outstanding liabilities. Such order may be made by the Court on the application of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Restoration — AdministrativeWhere a company has been struck off for a period not exceeding 12 months, an application for restoration may be made by it to the Registrar of Companies.  The company must file all outstanding annual returns, fees and the relevant late filing penalties within 12 months of the date of dissolution.Restoration — High CourtA company that has been dissolved via strike-off, for a period in excess of 12 months and not more than 20 years, may apply to the High Court to be restored.The applicant to the Court must obtain letters from the Registrar, the Chief State Solicitors Office (on behalf of the Minister for Finance) and the Revenue Commissioners stating there is no objection to the restoration of the company to the register.If the High Court grants the Order and all outstanding annual returns (including required accounts) have been delivered to the CRO along with an official copy of the Order the company will be restored to the register.If the Order has been granted and all outstanding annual returns (including required accounts) are delivered in final draft format only to the CRO the applicant must also provide a personal undertaking to file signed returns and accounts in identical form. In this case an Order for restoration will not have immediate effect unless the final signed returns (including accounts) are delivered to the CRO within one month from the date of the making of the Order. If the final returns are not submitted within the one month period the company will remain dissolved.A creditor may also apply to the Court for restoration of the company at any time from the date of dissolution of the company until the expiry of 20 years from the date of dissolution of the company.

As Minister with responsibilities in the areas of employment, trade and consumer protection, I am conscious that these price differentials are impacting on household budgets, businesses and indeed jobs.  I am aware of the concerns expressed by some retailers regarding the effect that current supply/distribution arrangements are having in terms of the cost of sourcing certain products when compared with the relative costs of sourcing such products in Northern Ireland and the UK.  I am strongly of the view that there must be greater transparency in all links in the retail chain as to the reasons for these price differentials.  I am determined to pursue all elements of the retail sector including, distributors, suppliers and retailers themselves to ensure that all benefits of the sustained Euro's appreciation in value, particularly against sterling are passed on to consumers.  I am strongly of the view that restoring consumers' confidence that they can get a fair deal will help, not only to address the current price differential concerns, but also in assisting businesses to retain trade and thereby help to maintain employment.

The Board was established in April 2004, under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, as part of the Government's insurance reform programme, with the aim of allowing certain classes of personal injury claim, where liability was uncontested, to be settled without the need for the costs associated with litigation.  Accordingly, the PIAB Act 2003 sets out the statutory functions of the Board and the process involved in assessing certain classes of personal injury claims.InjuriesBoard.ie is not a tribunal, does not involve litigation and does not hold "hearings".  It operates as an independent facilitator in the delivery of compensation entitlements in a fair and prompt manner for the benefit of society.  As such, personal injury claim assessments are made on the basis of medical evidence.All personal injury claims (with few exceptions such as medical negligence) must be submitted to InjuriesBoard.ie, unless settled directly between the parties.  A claimant may submit an application directly to InjuriesBoard.ie or may chose to use an agent to submit a claim and to correspond with the Board on his/her behalf.  Where a claimant uses an agent, the question of the fees charged is a matter between the parties involved.The PIAB Act 2003 does not contain any provision which regulates the relationship between a claimant and any agent appointed to act on his/her behalf.

The information is provided by companies on a confidential basis for statistical purposes only.  Information on individual companies is not disclosed for reasons of client confidentiality.The survey shows that in 2008 the total number of new jobs created in IDA Ireland supported companies in Limerick, Clare and North Tipperary was 438 while the number of jobs lost was 754.  A breakdown by county is set out in the attached tabular statement.The marketing of individual areas, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for IDA Ireland and not one in which I have a function.I am informed by IDA Ireland that during 2007, the Agency hosted 34 itineraries by potential investors  to  Limerick and  5 to Clare.  In 2008, there were 9 itineraries to  Limerick and 2 to Clare.

FÁS will provide advice and training opportunities for those losing their jobs.  The local FÁS Employment Services Manager has been in contact with executives in CIGNA in this regard.IDA Ireland is working with the management in Cigna to prepare a prospectus of the facility and profile of the workforce, which can be used to market the facility internationally through the offices of IDA Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland has a dedicated team for downsizing and closures that will work with the employees in Cigna in the coming months in order to explore potential spin out export orientated enterprises.The Galway County and City Enterprise Board and Galway Rural Development will also provide supports to employees who wish to establish micro enterprises and move into self employment.In recent years County Galway has had significant success in attracting investment from multinational firms.  IDA continues to work with new and existing overseas companies in Galway to encourage them to grow and expand.  In 2008 significant announcements included:CSN Stores will establish its EMEA Headquarters in Galway, creating 200 positions over the next 36 months in Multilingual Customer Service, IT, Localisation, Finance, HR and Sales & Marketing functions.Boston Scientific is to invest €50 million, with the support of IDA Ireland, in strategic Research and Development at its Galway facility.Thermo King, with the support of IDA Ireland, is to undertake a innovative Research and Design project on the next generation ‘environmentally friendly' products at its Galway site.Beckman Coulter Inc, with the support of IDA Ireland, is to launch an innovative four year collaborative research programme with NUI Galway in the field of Molecular Diagnostics.A number of other companies in County Galway have announced investments in recent years including Nortel Networks, Smith and Nephew, Fidelity Investments, IBM and Cisco. All of these investments will provide a stream of job opportunities in the region.The State development agencies under the remit of my Department have adopted a co-ordinated approach in response to recent job losses in County Galway.  The practice of establishing task forces has changed since the establishment of the County Development Boards (CDB). Rather than creating a further layer by establishing task forces, the relevant CDB is now seen as the body that is best placed to oversee any additional response that is required over and above the work of the Industrial Development Agencies under the auspices of my Department.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the State development agencies together with the ongoing commitment of Government to regional development will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment and employment for County Galway.

The CEB deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.The Board provides a single point of contact at local level for new and established small businesses.  All areas of the country are served by and benefit from, the full range of Enterprise Board grant supports and entrepreneurial development programmes.  Subject to certain eligibility criteria enterprises may access assistance and support from the CEB.  The forms of financial assistance which are available, subject to certain restrictions, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.In 2009 the CEB will continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.  This will be done not just by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.The Capital Allocation for the 35 CEBs under the 2009 Estimates Process stands at €20.8m; allocation of the individual budgets to each of the 35 CEBs for 2009 is currently being progressed by the CEB Central Coordination Unit (CCU) within Enterprise Ireland.

No awards have been made to officers of my Department under the scheme in respect of 2008. The pool for performance awards is 10% of the pay bill for the group concerned.The Deputy will be aware that my colleague the Minister for Finance recently announced the abolition of the performance-related award scheme. I am currently awaiting clarification from the Minister on the matter.

This application was refused on the grounds it is current Government policy to issue new work permits for highly skilled, highly paid positions or for non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or where there is an officially recognised scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.  Furthermore, newspaper advertisements for 3 days in both local and national newspapers were not submitted in support of the application. Also, the information supplied with the application appeared to indicate that the prospective employee's qualifications/experience did not correspond to the position on offer.The applicant was notified of this decision in writing by letter dated 29/1/2009 and of their right to appeal within 21 days.  To-date no such appeal has been received in the Employment Permits Section.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	514	Since 2004, Irish labour market policy has been to ensure that general labour and skills needs are met from within the workforce of the European Union. For strategic skills/labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand. The various schemes that give effect to such policies were introduced under the Employment Permits Act, 2006.Given that our current employment permit arrangements were designed to be vacancy-driven, the numbers of permit applications and consequent numbers of permits issued over the last six months have been showing a consistent downward trend.I am currently having our employment permit arrangements reviewed to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market.The numbers of work permits sought and granted or refused in 2008, and the total numbers of work permits that are in current use in the State, for all categories of employment, are set out in a number of tables.NewRenewalsTotalRefusedAssociate Professional & Technical Occupations1,7743852,159260Clerical & Secretarial Occupations14210224433Craft & Related Occupations6064821,088203Managers & Administrators526224750171Other Occupations1,1741,2242,398399Personal & Protective Service Occupations1,6641,8233,487736Plant & Machine Operatives11414425847Professional Occupations2,2764752,751352Sales Occupations20015135134Not specified075751Totals8,4765,08513,5612,236SectorNewRenewalsTotalService Industry5,5876,39411,981Catering1,5424,4866,028Medical & Nursing3,4901,9955,485Industry1,2561,1592,415Agriculture & Fisheries4541,4131,867Education317366683Domestic159496655Sport13958197Entertainment275077Exchange Agreements426Totals12,97516,41929,394

Renewals of appointments are handled on a similar basis.  The arrangements for such appointments are normally set out in the legislation establishing the State Body.The Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies stipulates that all State Bodies should have written Codes of Business Conduct for their directors and employees and provides (at Appendix B of the Code) that the principle of integrity should underlie the actions of a State Body's directors and employees.

On account of its designation as a National Historic Garden, its size and the fact that it is designed primarily for passive recreation, it is not appropriate that the Gardens should be designated as a National Music Park.  However, as in the past, the Gardens will continue to host suitable music events from time to time.

If it is non-commercial semi-state bodies there are 117 of these with spending of Euro 6 billion, almost Euro 4 billion of which is accounted for by the Higher Education Authority, the National Roads Authority, and FÁS.There are also many other bodies that he may be referring to such as hospitals (there are 53 in the HSE's Hospital Network), commercial state bodies (35), universities and other third level institutions (31), to health related bodies (12), just over 300 local and regional bodies and various ad-hoc and advisory bodies.  The estimate of the number of such bodies depends on the definitions used and the criteria applied.

In view of this, it is not accurate to suggest that a decision maker can wrongfully refuse a request as any such refusal must be based in law.If information is refused the requester can have the decision referred for internal review, and, if the information is still refused, the requester can appeal the decision to the Information Commissioner.

The terms of reference did not specifically cover loans to directors.PwC's work concentrated on a review of the top exposures which did not specifically include any loans to directors.

The terms applied to customers relate to the bank's normal ongoing business, and is accordingly a matter for the Board of Anglo. As with all financial institutions, Anglo Irish Bank is subject to regulation and supervision of its commercial activity by the Financial Regulator.The Deputy will be aware that the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement are currently conducting investigations into corporate governance issues at Anglo Irish Bank, including the terms of individual loans to individual Directors. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on or prejudge the outcome of these investigations.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	527	All entities regulated by the Financial Regulator including those credit institutions (Banks, and Building Societies) who are being supported under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 (Scheme), are required to comply with the terms and provisions of the Consumer Protection Code (Code).Under the provisions of the Code a regulated entity must ensure that in all its dealings with customers and within the context of its authorisation it, without prejudice to the pursuit of its legitimate commercial aims, does not, through its policies, procedures, or working practices, prevent access to basic financial services, and complies with the letter and spirit of the Code.In addition a regulated entity must take into consideration the provisions of the relevant anti-money laundering guidance notes and the approval of the Money Laundering Steering committee, and in particular any guidance in such notes on how to establish identity, in order to ensure that a person is not denied access to financial services solely on the grounds that this person does not possess certain specified identification documentation.I am in regular contact with the Financial Regulator on all matters relating to banking including access to credit and I am assured that all of the covered institutions are monitored for compliance with the Code. You will also be aware that I am in the process of approving codes of conduct for business lending and for mortgage arrears which will issue shortly to all of the credit institutions under the remit of the Financial Regulator including the covered institutions.  Both of these Codes contain provisions which should ensure improvements in the way banks treat customers.

Phase 1 of the scheme is already well advanced.The Steering Committee, which is overseeing the implementation of the scheme agreed at its meeting in January to examine the feasibility of bringing forward the construction of the Quay wall element of the scheme. That and the feasibility of expediting the design of the entire scheme are being examined.I visited Clonmel on Saturday and saw for myself the devastation caused by the flooding in the town. I fully understand the anxiety of people who are at risk from what has become very frequent flooding and sympathise with those who have suffered loss or damage or been subjected to the trauma that flooding causes. I am committed to ensuring the Flood Relief Scheme is completed as quickly as possible.

The Scheme requires each covered institution to prepare and submit a plan to structure the remuneration packages of directors and executives so as to take account of the objectives of the Scheme.The relevant plans have been prepared and submitted by the covered institutions, and in line with the timeframes set out in the Scheme, CIROC will report to me on or before 5th March 2009, making a recommendation where appropriate, on the compliance by the institution with the terms of the Scheme.  The Scheme provides that if required, I may direct the institution to amend the remuneration plan to comply with the Scheme.The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach announced to the House on the 4th of February that in the context of recapitalisation of the banks, that he would expect director's fees to be cut by 25% and when they appoint their top executives there would be an upper limit on remuneration and that he would expect that to be at least 25% below current levels.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The Acting Chief Executive's annual salary amounts to €285,341.  This is the same salary as applied to the previous Chief Executive and also covers the Acting Chief Executive's continuing role as Consumer Director. The contract does not provide for performance related payments.The Regulatory Authority has informed me that pension benefits to the Acting Chief Executive are payable in accordance with the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Superannuation Scheme.  Benefits are based on final salary.  However, if any officer has had a change in grade or has received a personal change in salary — other than a general or grade increase or normal increments — within 3 years of the retirement date, his/her salary is averaged in calculating pensionable salary.  Lump sum superannuation benefits are calculated by reference to pensionable remuneration and reckonable service. The maximum lump sum payable is 1½ times final pensionable salary.  Pension entitlements are also calculated by reference to pensionable remuneration up to a maximum of 50% of salary.

I am informed that the Chief Executive's contract did not provide for performance related payments.The Regulatory Authority has informed me that pension benefits to the former Chief Executive are payable in accordance with the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Superannuation Scheme.  This Scheme has terms and conditions which allow, in certain circumstances, for the payment of full pension benefits in cases where less than 40 years service is accrued.I am informed that the former Chief Executive had two years remaining on his contract.  I am also informed that, having regard to independent legal advice and his exclusive availability to the Authority for a period of three months, the Authority agreed to the payment of an additional €151,500, equivalent to six months remuneration, plus an additional two months salary, to the former Chief Executive.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 228 to 232, inclusive, together.The projected expenditure on public service pensions for 2009 is estimated at €2.7 billion.  This figure covers superannuation payments in respect of all public service pension schemes and covers main scheme pensions, spouses pensions and retirement lump sums.  As with all estimates of future pension payments there is a significant element of approximation about the figure. Various demographic and socioeconomic factors will affect the final outcome.Public servants will be subject to the pension related deduction announced on Tuesday 3 February 2009, including those with less than two years service. It is an additional deduction and existing pension contributions made by public servants will continue unchanged.  The deduction will apply to all pay including allowances and overtime. Sums paid in respect of travel and subsistence allowances will not be subject to the deduction. The deduction will be made from the individual public servant's remuneration as a periodic payroll deduction.The pension deduction element of the payroll saving will be €1.35 billion in a full-year and €1.12 billion in 2009.   Public servants will be subject to the deduction at the following rates.RemunerationRate of deductionThe first €15,0003%The next €5,0006%The remainder10%The rates the Deputy refers to were part of the illustrative table showing the effect of the deduction as a percentage of overall income at different income levels.

While the specific details of what the Government announced last week were not known when the Department published the Addendum, the broad order of magnitude of the necessary expenditure reductions were taken account of in arriving at the overall forecasts of GDP growth of -4½ per cent and a contraction of tax revenue of about -9¼ per cent for 2009.

All data in the table is expressed as a percentage of the GDP of the particular year in question.While the projections in Table 6 of the SPU are a technical representation of what is required to  achieve the overall fiscal adjustments over the period out to 2013, and are ultimately subject top future policy decisions by Government.  The detailed breakdown between the revenue and expenditure decisions that will be required will be set out in future Budgets.Last week the Government took decisions on saving €2 billion and the focus was on expenditure.  In the Addendum, the need for further adjustments in each of the years out to 2013 was set out.  In this regard the work of the Special Group on Public Services Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and the work of the Commission on Taxation will be important factors in forming next year's budgetary parameters which will inform future adjustments.  While no decisions have been taken yet, all aspects of expenditure, both current and capital, as well as taxation will play a part in securing the necessary adjustments.In presenting the Addendum to the European Commission, it was necessary to distribute the adjustments in order to ensure the technical completion of the required tables.  This distribution was broadly undertaken on a two-thirds to one-third basis of expenditure to revenue but in no way pre-empts future decisions of Government which could result in a different apportionment in the light of emerging budgetary conditions in the period 2010 to 2013.

In this case, in line with EUROSTAT guidelines, the transaction is treated as a financial transaction, and consequently, will have no impact on the General Government Balance. It was not necessary, therefore, to include the expenditures on recapitalisation in the latest fiscal projections.The recently published Addendum to the Stability Programme Update outlines the latest economic and fiscal forecasts for the period 2009-2013. The projections outlined in the Addendum do not take account of the receipts under the charge of the bank guarantee for the covered institutions. The charge is being credited to a dedicated account maintained at the Central Bank. It is anticipated that at the expiry of the Guarantee Scheme, any amount standing to the account will be transferred to the Exchequer as revenue. At that stage the amount transferred will then be reflected in the General Government Balance.

It is the difference between total receipts into and total expenditure out of the Exchequer Account of the Central Fund.The projected Exchequer Balance for the year 2009 to 2013 is as follows.20092010201120122013€m€m€m€m€m-17,980-16,860-13,769-11,583-8,081The General Government Balance (GGB) measures the fiscal performance of all arms of Government, i.e. Central Government, Local Authorities, Health Boards, Vocational Education Committees and non-commercial State sponsored bodies, as well as funds such as the Social Insurance Fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It thus provides an accurate assessment of the fiscal performance of a more complete government sector.The main differences between the Exchequer Balance and the General Government Balance are the impact of various funds, including Extra Budgetary Funds, non-commercial State sponsored bodies, the Social Insurance Fund and the net borrowing of the Local Government Sector, as well as the impact of the National Pension Reserve Fund, and accrual adjustments.  The estimated impact of these for the years 2009 to 2013 are as follows.20092010201120122013€m€m€m€m€mFunds-1365-1727-932-750-559Impact of the National Pension Reserve Fund2,1892,1652,2902,4572,592Accrual Adjustments-9151319433510General Government Balance-17,165-16,271-12,092-9,443-5,537

Last week the Government decided to defer this pay agreement until 2011, when further discussions will take place. As this decision post dates the publication of the addendum to the Irish Stability Programme this deferment will lead to a saving in 2010. Allowance was also made for changes in the demographic structure which would impact on employee numbers, notably in the case of education, which will impact on the pay bill.Budget 2009 did not allow for any explicit non-pay deflator in the years 2009 to 2011. In January, however, the non-pay estimates were amended to allow for the costs associated with the higher Live Register and the Pig meat crisis and other pressures. A non-pay deflator (in line with the inflation forecast) was allowed for price increases in 2012 and 2013.Capital resources are made up of EU receipts, FEOGA loan repayments, the sinking fund provision and certain other miscellaneous receipts. In 2008 €1,398 million was received in capital resources of which, €113.5 million was received in ERDF receipts, €740 million in FEOGA repayments and €488 million for the sinking fund provision.The forecast for capital resources is €1,579 million in 2009; €1,735 million in 2010; €1,868 million in 2011; €1,961 million in 2012 and €2,046 million in 2013.

This took into account the requirement for a €2 billion adjustment. The forecast for debt service costs in 2009, estimated at €4,500 million, takes into account the fiscal consolidation objective.The expenditure adjustments announced on 3rd February last will yield €1.8 billion in 2009 and €2.1 billion in a full year. This is broadly in line with the indicative annual adjustment as set out in Table 4 of the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update. As such it is consistent with the overall macro-economic and fiscal forecasts published in early January. Accordingly, a General Government deficit in the order of 9½% of GDP is forecast in 2009.

With regard to exchange rates, the norm is for my Department to use the Commission's assumptions. These hold constant the averages from a 10 day reference period. However, for the economic projections produced in the Addendum, updated assumptions were not available from the Commission. As such, and in line with international practice, the exchange rate was held constant at average levels for December 2008. This implies a 14% appreciation of the euro against sterling for this year as a whole and a 9% depreciation against the dollar. The assumed price changes were broadly in line with those of our major trading partners.

Over 60 of these sites are presented to the public with a dedicated guide service. The OPW has a series of price bands for the different sites, which reflect the relative popularity of individual sites. Some sites are presented to the public free of charge.In 2008 revenue generated amounted to €7.1 million and it is estimated the salaries attributed to these sites totalled €9.5 million. Works at these Heritage sites are carried out in the main as part of the overall maintenance and conservation works programme of a directly employed workforce. There is no specific budget allocation for the facilities at each site.

The Scheme provides for controls on executive remuneration in institutions covered by the Guarantee.The Scheme requires each covered institution to prepare and submit a plan to structure the remuneration packages of directors and executives so as to take account of the objectives of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  Remuneration is taken to include total salary, bonuses, pension payments and any other benefits received. In the context of these plans, bonuses will be measurably linked to reductions in the guarantee charges, reduction in excessive risk taking, and encouraging the long-term sustainability of the covered institution.The relevant plans have been prepared and submitted by the covered institutions, including Anglo Irish Bank, and in line with timeframes set out in the Scheme, the Committee will report to me on or before the 5th March 2009, making a recommendation where appropriate, on the compliance by the institution with the terms of the Scheme. The Scheme provides that if required, I may direct the institution to amend the remuneration plan to comply with the Scheme.As with the other covered institutions, the terms and conditions of employment for less senior staff are a matter for the Board of Anglo.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 225 together.The provisions of section 31 of the Finance (No 2) Act 2008 provide for relief from corporation tax for their first 3 years of operation for companies incorporated on and from 14 October 2008 that commence to carry on a new trade in 2009.  The relief is granted by reducing the corporation tax on the profits of the new trade and on the gains from disposal of assets used for the purpose of the new trade to nil.  Full relief is available where the corporation tax otherwise payable by the company in respect of any of its first 3 years is €40,000 or less.  There is marginal relief where the corporation tax liability is between €40,000 and €60,000.The intention is that this relief will comply with the EU de minimis Aid Regulations.  These Regulations set the level of de minimis aid available, generally, at €200,000 over any three year period.  In the case of the road transport sector, the figure is €100,000.  Any tax relief under the provisions of section 31 of Finance (No 2) Act 2008 will affect the amount of further State aid that a company can receive.  The requirement that the company be newly registered ensures that we are starting at the beginning as regards State aids.   In addition, with the new company requirement, the new trade will be easily distinguishable from other businesses run by a promoter and/or other related companies which is important so as to ensure against any abuse of the measure.For these reasons, I had to choose a date to define a "new company" under the legislation and incorporation from the date of Budget 2009 is a reasonable approach.  I have received some representations in this issue.  However, I do not propose to amend this requirement of the legislation.

The position is that the income levy applies to gross income and constitutes an additional tax.The income base on which the income levy is applied is different to that of income tax or, indeed Pay Related Social Insurance (PSRI) contributions and health levy contributions.  Gross income in the context of the income levy is income before any deductions for contributions to superannuation or capital allowances.  Also included in the income base for the income levy are a number of income sources excluded from the income tax base.  The income levy applies generally to all taxpayers and is progressive.  In these circumstances, the issue of whether the overall system breaches the principle of natural justice does not arise.

Subsequently, I met a wide range of representatives from the betting industry where the problems faced by the sector, including those arising from the Budgetary changes, were discussed.The Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 provides that the betting duty rate will be increased from 1% to 2% on 1 May 2009.  The Act also provides that, as happens in the case of other business expenses, betting duty paid by a bookmaker on bets made on or after 1 January 2009 will be allowed as a deduction in computing the amount of profits or losses of the bookmaking business for Income Tax or Corporation Tax purposes.As I stated during the Finance Bill process, I intend to look at an overhaul of the betting tax regime for next year's Budget and Finance Bill, possibly looking at the UK's gross profits tax model.  The estimated yield arising from the 1% increase in the betting duty on 1 May 2009 is around €14m in 2009 and €33m in a full year.

Providing there are no objections and planning permission is granted, invitations to tender for the works could be issued in May 2009, with work commencing later this year, subject to funding.Work on the Keep has commenced with inspection works, initial condition assessment and mortar analysis.  Scaffolding has been erected and the decking has been completed.  Restoration work of its nature is time-consuming and investigatory, and therefore incapable of a precise schedule, but it is estimated that it will take approximately 12-18 months to complete.  Works to the interior of the Keep are ongoing, and significant progress has been made.The perimeter of the Castle Field has been secured for the duration of the works.  The Chief State Solicitor has forwarded a draft lease in relation to the transfer of the Castle Field to Nenagh Town Council, which is expected to be finalised, when works are completed.  The design and installation of the drawbridge and presentation of other outstanding features of the Castle Gatehouse will follow the conservation works of the Keep.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	563	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that money that is received by an individual in respect of the letting, for residential purposes, of part of that individual's home is exempt from income tax, income levy, PRSI and the health levy where it is below €10,000.  Any amount received for meals, cleaning, laundry or other similar goods and services that are incidentally provided in connection with the residential use is also taken into account.  This relief is known as Rent-a-Room relief.In establishing whether the income arising in respect of residential accommodation and ancillary services exceeds the exempt limit, the gross amount of that income is taken into account.  No deduction is allowed for any expenses that have been incurred in connection with obtaining that income.  Where the gross income exceeds the €10,000 exemption limit in a particular year the full amount is taxable and not just the amount that exceeds the limit.The residence must be situated in the State and be occupied by an individual as his/her sole or main residence during the particular tax year.  The individual does not have to own the residence and it could, for example, be occupied as rented accommodation.  It is not possible to let an entire residence because the room(s) that is let must form part of the residence and the residence must be occupied by the individual receiving the rent as his/her sole or main residence.  The relief does not apply where the part of the residence that is let is used for business purposes.The availability of certain other tax reliefs is not affected by the receipt of income that is exempted from tax under the rent-a-room relief scheme.  These include an individual's entitlement to mortgage interest relief on his/her principal private residence, the exemption from Capital Gains Tax on gains arising from the disposal of an individual's principal private residence and owner-occupier relief where the residence is situated in a tax incentive area such as an urban renewal scheme area.  Additionally, an individual who pays rent for private rented accommodation that he/she uses as his/her main residence is entitled to claim tax relief for the rent paid where that individual sub-lets part of the accommodation.  A tenant of an individual who is claiming rent-a-room relief may claim tax relief for rent paid.First-time buyers and certain owner-occupiers can obtain relief from stamp duty on the purchase of a house/apartment.  A clawback of the relief arises if rent is obtained from the letting of the house/apartment in the two-year period from the date of purchase.  However, such a clawback does not apply where rent is received for the letting of furnished accommodation in part of the premises by an individual who owns and occupies the premises.  The individual must continue to occupy the premises as his/her only or main residence for the required two-year period.  Unlike rent-a-room relief for income tax, there is no upper limit on the amount of rent that can be received in relation to stamp duty where part of the premises has been let.I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a guidance note on the Rent-a-Room relief scheme is available at www.revenue.ie in the "Leaflets" section of the website.

In the context of discussions on recapitalisation before Christmas Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland committed to, amongst other things, providing an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009.  The banks also committed to actively promote mortgage lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.A new code of conduct for Mortgage Arrears, based in the Irish Banking Federation Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears, is under discussion and will shortly be introduced by the Financial Regulator.  The new Code is expected to apply to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and to be mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator.The Government increased the rate of mortgage interest relief for first time buyers in Budget 2009 from 20% to 25% in year 1 & 2 of their mortgage and to 22.5% in year 3 and 5.  It will remain at 20% in year 6 and 7.  This measure follows on from the significant improvements made in Budget 2007 & 2008.  The ceiling for mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers was doubled in Budget 2007 from €4,000 single/€8,000 married to €8,000 single/€16,000 married.  The ceiling for first-time buyers was further increased in Budget 2008 to €10,000 single/€20,000 married.In addition, the Government announced the introduction of a new mortgage scheme in the context of Budget 2009.  The Home Choice Loan has been introduced through the local authority system, backed by loan finance raised by the Housing Finance Agency.  HCL is available to first time buyers of new houses (or self-builds), subject to a maximum loan of €285,000 or max LTV of 92% (whichever is the lesser) and income thresholds.  The Regulations to underpin the scheme were signed in December and the scheme commenced on 1 January 2009.

Where the income levy has been applied for particular pay period(s) during the year and the individual has an entitlement to a full medical card, then they will be due a refund of any income levy paid in the year.  In this situation, the employer/pension provider should make an adjustment at year's end and refund all income levy deducted during the year.Where the employee has not been in continuous employment with an employer or in receipt of a pension from a pension provider throughout the year in question, the Revenue Commissioners, rather than the employer/pension provider, will make any refund of income levy due on a claim being made.

They are available for purchase through any Post Office.The Agency's personal savings products generally had a particularly successful year in 2008, bringing in almost double the highest annual level of receipts since the Agency was established in 1990.  Between them, savings bonds, savings certificates and national instalment savings brought in some €600 million net in 2008, bringing the amount outstanding in respect of those products to €4.9 billion at the end of the year.

The three member, independent committee will oversee remuneration plans of senior executives of the covered institutions.  The relevant plans have been prepared and submitted by the covered institutions, and in line with timeframes set out in the Scheme, CIROC will report to me on or before 5th March 2009, making a recommendation where appropriate, on the compliance by the institution with the terms of the Scheme.  The Scheme provides that if I consider, following the advice of CIROC, that the institution has not demonstrated how its remuneration policies for the year ahead will comply with Section 47, I may direct the covered institution to amend its remuneration plan so that compliance is achieved.It is important to emphasise that one of the key features of this part of the Scheme is the requirement to orient a system of bonuses to create the appropriate incentives, incentives that point toward reduction in excessive risk-taking and that promote long-term sustainability.  A covered institution may not enter into any contractual arrangement that provides for termination compensation or equivalent to be payable to any director or executive for the duration of the Scheme.The Taoiseach announced in the House last week that in the context of recapitalisation of the banks, that he would expect director's fees to be cut by 25% and when they appoint their top executives there would be an upper limit on remuneration and that he would expect current levels would be cut by at least 25% as well.

It will not apply to occupational or State pension income received by retired public servants.  It is not being applied to the commercial semi state sector.  The deduction will apply to all remuneration including allowances and overtime.  It is intended that the pension deduction will apply to employees in bodies where a public service pension scheme exists or may be made.  Where an employee has no pension benefits under a scheme the Minister for Finance will have powers to exclude him or her.

It is estimated that just over 1,000 staff (fte) — approximately 3% excluding staff serving in the Prisons Service — were not employed on a permanent basis.  These staff are employed on a variety of tasks and assignments and their number fluctuates depending on factors such as seasonal variations (e.g. recruitment of temporary staff to cover term time vacancies, peak workloads such as passports, examinations, etc).

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	573	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the position in relation to the transactions concerned is as follows.  With regard to VAT, the renting of residential property is exempt from VAT.  Before 1 July 2008, where a developer let a residential property, this would have resulted in a full claw-back of all the VAT incurred on the construction of that property, which had been reclaimed by the developer.Since 1 July 2008 there is a special rule for property developers who construct a residential property for sale but subsequently rent that property.  In such circumstances, rather than suffering the negative cash flow effect of a full claw-back of VAT deducted in respect of the development costs, the developer is obliged to pay back to Revenue 1/20th of the VAT deducted at the end of each year that the property is rented.  When the property is eventually sold VAT is chargeable on the sale price at the reduced rate of VAT, currently 13.5%.  In most cases, if the sale price is reduced by the amount of rent paid, VAT will be chargeable on the reduced amount.  This is provided that the rent paid during the rental period is a bona fide market rent.  If a premium were paid above the market rent, that premium would be treated as an option payment relating to the sale of the property and would, therefore, be liable to VAT at 13.5%.In relation to stamp duty, the purchase of a new house or apartment with a floor area not exceeding 125 square metres is exempt from stamp duty where the house or apartment is occupied as the main residence of the purchaser for a period of two years from the date of the purchase.  There is also a relief from stamp duty in the case of the purchase of a new house or apartment where the floor area exceeds 125 square metres and the house or apartment is occupied as the main residence of the purchaser for a period of two years from the date of the purchase.  Under this relief the stamp duty is charged on the site value or one quarter of the total value of the property whichever is the greater.  Where an intended purchaser occupies a newly built house under "a rent to purchase scheme" and the house is subsequently purchased by that person as part of the scheme, the property is regarded as new for the purposes of the stamp duty reliefs described above.

The exact additional cost depends on individual circumstances, for example; whether the individual is married or single, whether he/she is signing on with the Department of Social and Family Affairs for full benefits or signing on due to reduced working hours, and, crucially, in terms of tax forgone, on the amount of income that they would have previously been earning.With regard to social welfare payments, it is estimated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs that each 1,000 increase in the Live Register in 2008 added €11.55 million to expenditure on Jobseeker Allowance and Jobseekers Benefit payments and in 2009 will add €11.77 million.  Receipt of secondary benefits is linked to the circumstances of individuals and as such it is very difficult to disaggregate jobseekers from other social welfare recipients in receipt of such benefits.With regard to the loss of tax and PRSI revenue, a specific cost is not possible to compute without knowing the specifics of each individual's personal circumstance.  However, based on a number of assumptions outlined below, an overall aggregate estimate of the likely tax forgone for every 1,000 people losing employment is approximately €8 million in a full year, based on 2008 figures.The assumptions underlining this figure are:The 1,000 workers are made up of workers earning the minimum wage, the average industrial wage and twice the average industrial wage;There is a 30:55:15 distribution between those earning the minimum wage, average industrial wage and those earning twice the average industrial wage, broadly reflecting the economy wide situation; andThe breakdown by marital status also broadly follows the economy wide breakdown.No account is taken of the following:Employees' pension contributions or other salary sacrifice arrangements;Minor tax credits or income tax reliefs such as health expenses relief, rent relief, trade union subscriptions;The impact of any redundancy packages;Whether the employee takes up alternative employment in the tax year; andThe timing of the job losses within the tax year.The above factors are crucial in determining the actual cost in any one year and could reduce the cost significantly in that year.

The actual amount of tax relief depends on an individual's circumstances but as a broad rule of thumb it is estimated that about one third of the amount will accrue in tax relief to public servants.  As a result, the €1.4 billion is a saving on the expenditure side of the account that has implications for the revenue side.However, in terms of the economic and fiscal impact, a €2 billion adjustment was factored in to the Addendum to the Stability Programme Update published on 9 January.  Therefore, the Department's forecasts, which anticipate growth contracting by 4.5% and show aggregate taxes falling by a further 9¼% this year after the contraction of 13¾% last year, already take account of the need to secure reductions of up to €2 billion in expenditure this year.

Savings of €15 million will also be found across a range of Defence expenditure, including equipment purchases.The €80 million savings on professional fees will arise from an 8% reduction on fees to legal, medical, veterinary and other professions engaged by the public service.  The precise details of individual Vote allocations are currently being finalised in consultation with Departments and will be included in the upcoming Revised Estimates Volume 2009.

For CGT purposes, the date of disposal of land acquired under a compulsory purchase order is the earlier of the date the authority enters on the land, and the date on which the compensation is agreed.This general rule does not apply, however, where the disposal is under a compulsory purchase order and is for the purposes of, or ancillary to, road construction, widening or extension, the person making the disposal is engaged in farming, and immediately before the disposal, the land was used for the purposes of farming.  In these circumstances, the date of disposal for CGT purposes is not until the date the compensation is received.As the Deputy may be aware, I have made a number of changes to the CGT code in my recent Budget and Finance Act.  These include changes to the payment dates and also an increase in the rate of CGT from 20% to 22% for disposals made on or after 14 October 2008.  Therefore, in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy, the rate of CGT on a disposal of land acquired under a compulsory purchase order, where the compensation was received between 1 January and 13 October 2008, was 20%; and the rate of CGT for such a disposal, where the compensation was received after 14 October 2008, is 22%.

Assistant Secretary Awards: Following recommendations made by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, schemes of performance-related awards were introduced for the levels of Deputy Secretary and Assistant Secretary in the civil service, as well as for the Deputy Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner ranks in the Garda Síochána and the ranks of Brigadier General and Major General in the Defence Forces.The schemes of awards are based on performance by reference to demanding targets.  The pool for performance awards is 10% of the pay bill for the group concerned.  Within that overall limit individuals can receive payments of up to 20% of pay.Decisions on awards are made by the Committee for Performance Awards (CPA), which includes a majority of private sector members.  The main roles of the committee are to monitor the application of the scheme of performance-related awards and to bring independent judgement to bear in approving objectives for the persons covered by the scheme and in approving recommendations for awards.Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the schemes, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the committee (available on the website www.finance.gov.ie.  The committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.Following my announcement in the Dáil on 5 February last relating to the discontinuation of the scheme for Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Secretary and related grades subject to consultation with the relevant Staff Associations, there is now no specific provision for payment under this scheme.  This scheme is the only full bonus scheme in operation in the civil service. The following arrangements which apply to other grades provide for reward for exceptional merit or effort in particular cases.Special Service PaymentsPrincipals and Assistant Principals have a separate scheme which arises as a result of the restructuring agreement for these grades under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  It provides that 1% of payroll for these grades be made available in the form of Special Service Payments, for which staff are invited to apply, based on the following criteria: contribution by the individual to the work of the Department in his/her job, special demands of the job, experience brought to the job.Merit AwardsIn 1993, the then Minister for Finance sanctioned expenditure in respect of Merit Awards to individual staff members or groups of staff below Assistant Secretary level by way of recognition for exceptional performance of duty which was based on 0.1% of the salary allocation (as published in the Revised Estimates) in any one calendar year.  This percentage was revised to 0.2% in 1998.An independent committee administers the Merit Awards scheme up to AO/HEO level; an Assistant Secretary group administers the Awards at Assistant Principal and Principal level.  Nominees for the annual Merit Awards must, during the year, have demonstrated one or more of the following criteria: given an exceptional performance in some aspect of his/her work, demonstrated unusual commitment and dedication to some aspect of his/her work, made a notable contribution to the successful achievement of the section's targets.Ex-gratia payments are made in a number of situations which are outside the remit of the schemes already mentioned.  There have been no payments made to date to staff in my Department for 2008 in respect of any of the above schemes.  In relation to the SSP and merit awards schemes, no specific provision has been made for 2009.

If the Deputy would like to provide details of the specific case, the Revenue Commissioners will examine the matter and furnish a report directly to the Deputy.

This was prior to the nationalisation of Anglo. Executive Directors received no bonuses.

It is further estimated that the non-payment of the pay phases under the Review and Transitional Agreement will yield, for the group in question, some €55m in 2009, €220m in 2010 and €260m in 2011.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The taxation of individuals in the State is in line with that prevailing in other jurisdictions, that is to say — (a) individuals who are resident in the State for tax purposes are taxable here on their worldwide income; and (b) individuals who are not resident here for tax purposes pay tax here only on income arising in the State.I have no plans to change this treatment and nor have I plans to make all Irish citizens living abroad resident here for tax purposes.  Whether or not an individual chooses to live here or abroad — for whatever reason — is a matter for that individual and the State will not interfere with an individual's choice of where he or she wishes to live.  Indeed, many Irish citizens choose to live abroad for reasons other than the tax system.As regards the questions raised by the Deputy, as non-resident individuals (including non-resident Irish citizens) have an obligation to make a tax return only in respect of their Irish sourced income, it is impossible to quantify the potential tax yield if all Irish citizens living abroad were to pay tax here on their worldwide income.  There is also the added difficulty that, under the terms of double taxation agreements between this State and another jurisdiction, that other jurisdiction may have the primary taxing rights on income arising there and there would be no yield to the State on the income in question.

The Revenue Anti-Evasion Team also covers Killybegs Port as part of their ongoing patrols.Customs officers have assessed the risk at Killybegs and other ports or landing places over a number of years and this assessment is being continually updated.  Attendance by Customs officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Patrols of the ports are kept under constant review to take account of available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends.There are no plans to extend the current level of customs entry facilities at Killybegs Port.

These savings will be applied to the benefit of the Exchequer and are not earmarked for the National Pension Reserve Fund. It will not affect the gross cost of existing or future public service pension payments.The introduction of the pension deduction does not give rise to any change in the annual contribution by the State to the National Pensions Reserve Fund which was established for the purpose of meeting as much as possible of the costs to the Exchequer of social welfare and public service pensions to be paid from the year 2025 to the year 2055 or such subsequent years as may be specified by Ministerial order.

For example, the Mortgage Interest Supplement, administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, provides assistance where the mortgage relates to their sole place of residence.  In addition the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), is a national, free, confidential and independent service for people in debt or in danger of getting into debt.It is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession.  Home repossession should be, and generally is, the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention.A new code of conduct for Mortgage Arrears, based on the Irish Banking Federation Code of Practice on Mortgage Arrears is under discussion and will shortly be introduced by the Financial Regulator.  The new code is expected to apply to mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State and to be mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator.

However, the arrangements for property disposal require Department of Finance approval in each case, the lodging of the proceeds as Exchequer Extra Receipts and the re-Voting of the funds for approved projects.  A submission detailing the priority projects to be funded from disposals to date and planned future disposals is expected to be made by the HSE, for consideration by my Department and the Department of Finance, within the coming months.

The 94th. Unit Scouts, Bunting Road, Walkinstown application for funding of €112,000 towards the upgrading and extension of the Scout Hall was submitted through the Dublin 12 Development Group.All applications were provisionally assessed by the National Assessment Committee against set criteria.  The process was put on hold due to the impending transfer, at the time, of the Fund to my Department.As the Deputy is aware since the original decision to transfer the Fund the economic landscape has changed dramatically.  In light of the fiscal constraints now faced by Government all funding streams are being examined with a view to ensuring compliance with the Government's desire to adjust spending commitments across all Departments.  A decision in relation to these applications will be notified to all relevant Development Groups shortly.

A report on the research is expected to be finalised in the coming months.  The issue of funding of medical school places is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education and Science.The Health Service Executive is currently discussing GP training and manpower issues with the Irish College of General Practitioners and other organisations with a view to addressing GP manpower shortfalls into the future.The HSE is also responsible for implementing the Primary Care Strategy and the cooperation and availability of general practitioners is, of course, critical to this process.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The Food Supplements Directive, 2002/46/EC, has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 506 of 2007.  That legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This ensures that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.   One of the objectives of the Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC) was to make provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.  This matter remains under consideration at European Commission level.The European Commission published a Discussion Paper on determining maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in June 2006.  The Irish response to this Discussion Paper gave Ireland's view that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people, those on medications and various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the position on this issue.  A working document on the setting of maximum and minimum levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements was drawn up as a result of the responses from industry, consumer groups and national governments to the Discussion Paper.  The Commission has proposed in the working document that in the case of certain nutrients where studies have indicated there is evidence of no, or low, toxicity even at high level dosage, that it may be possible to waive the setting of maximum levels.  The Commission consider this a proportionate approach which is in line with the principle of Better Regulation.While the Irish position remains one of precaution for the reasons set out above, we will take account of Irish consumers' views and those of industry in adopting a position during those discussions.  In this regard the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) Consultative Council hosted an open meeting on 27 January 2009 to discuss the issues relating to food supplements.  This meeting was attended by a cross section of stakeholders and outlined details of new developments in European legislation, which regulates food supplements and food fortification.  The meeting outlined the rationale behind proposed EU regulations to safeguard consumer health in relation to food supplements and an insight into why consumers take food supplements and their understanding of the perceived health benefits.Officials from both my Department and the FSAI are involved in ongoing discussions at European level on the development of a methodology under which maximum safe levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set.  Those discussions will permit the European Commission and Member States to further develop its thinking on this issue and our final position will be based on these discussions and on the scientific evidence presented to Member States during the discussions.

Following international peer review, MRCG and the HRB issued co-funding for two projects with Muscular Dystrophy Ireland, one to the Imperial College in London — the exon skipping trial — and the other to the project referred to by the Deputy in NUI Maynooth.I have been advised by the HRB that another MRCG/HRB funding call has opened to all research charities, including Muscular Dystrophy Ireland and Duchenne Ireland.  However, it is up to each charity to solicit and pre-review applications for submission to the HRB.  The HRB is scheduled to receive the applications in June 2009.  All applications received will be assessed on the basis of excellence and impact.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	613	The Pharmacy 2007 requires the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland to maintain a register of retail pharmacy businesses.  Each retail pharmacy business has to meet certain minimum criteria regarding the facilities, storage and sale of medicinal products on their premises.  Registration is required on an annual basis and inspections can be carried out by the Society.The Society, has been, and continues to be, a self financing body.  These new functions place additional costs on the Society.  The Society engaged consultants to develop an evidence-based methodology for the determination of registration fees, on a viable and sustainable self-financing basis.  The process included a comparative analysis of comparable international pharmacy regulators.  I am informed by the Society that the arrangements for registration in Northern Ireland and the UK are substantially different to what is being introduced here.  In particular, the range of duties of regulatory bodies in the UK, in terms of statutory obligations and their role in public safety, is not as extensive as those required of the Society under the Pharmacy Act 2007.The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has undertaken to keep the fees  for the registration of retail pharmacy businesses under review throughout 2009, and update me as to their appropriate level when submitting its 2010 fee submission.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	618	On the 28th November 2008 I signed the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (Registration) Rules 2008 (S.I. No. 494 of 2008) which provide for new pharmaceutical registration systems, including a system for a non-EU/EEA route of qualification recognition and registration. These Rules came into force on 29th November 2008.  The PSI concentrated its efforts, in the first instance, on putting in place the system for registration of retail pharmacy businesses.  This process of ensuring that all retail pharmacy businesses were registered was successfully completed in January 2009.In relation to the non-EU/EEA route of qualification recognition and registration, the PSI is committed to ensuring that the application system for recognition of a third country qualification, and the associated registration system, is fully operational as soon as time, legal advice and resources permit.  A considerable amount of preliminary work was carried out before the signing of the rules and the Society has, since then, been working with its legal advisers to develop an appropriate process in line with the legislation.  The PSI anticipates that the relevant documentation will be available for download by applicants within a month. In the meantime, any potential applicant is advised to consult the Education & Registration Unit of the PSI to ensure that he/she will have the required documentation prepared for submission to the PSI as soon as the process is commenced.  The PSI will shortly communicate the operational date for commencement of the process to all potential applicants.

Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.With regard to the other questions raised by the Deputy, I met the Irish Dental Association on the 15th November last to discuss a range of issues including the terms of the Agreement that governs the Dental Treatment Services Scheme and the Government's plans to amend the Competition Act 2002. I am keeping these matters under review.

It is currently operating as a 30 bed unit, of which 28 beds are residential and 2 are respite.  At present there are 25 long stay residents, with one long stay admission to the facility in the last six months.An independent review carried out highlighted the lack of facilities to provide appropriate care and the home's inability to support high dependency patients.  This inadequacy increases demands in terms of maintenance, standards and health and safety issues including infection control.  Following this review the Executive decided that the 30 bed Bethany House Welfare Home is no longer able to provide appropriate services due to the increasing levels of dependencies of its patients.I would like to reassure the Deputy that all 25 residents, in consultation with themselves and their families, will be relocated to better and safer facilities that are purpose built to cater for their health and well-being.  The immediate next steps for the Executive are to consult with each resident, their families or representatives, to explain what options are available with a view to agreeing their preferences for relocation.

However, the provision of support by HSE towards the cost of maintenance in a private nursing home is subject to resources.  In this regard, the availability of enhanced subvention is limited by the amount of the resource allocated forthis scheme and applicants may need to join a waiting list for enhanced subvention contributions.

The Act is not explicit on the particular issue raise by the Deputy. However, the HSE's National Guidelines for the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme state that the private nursing home should advise the HSE of any temporary absences or discharges of patients in receipt of subvention from their nursing home.  The HSE can continue to pay subvention to cover temporary absences.  However if this period of absence continues for more than one month, the HSE should investigate the matter further to establish the likelihood of the person returning to the nursing home.

It also decided to explore the scope in the medium term for developing a joint venture based on a satellite centre in the North West linked to Belfast City Hospital.Cancer patients in the North West requiring radiation oncology treatment are referred to either St. Luke's Hospital Dublin or University College Hospital Galway.  A Service Level Agreement is also in place for the referral of radiation oncology patients from Donegal to Belfast City Hospital.In April 2008, Minister Michael McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSS&PS), Northern Ireland announced the provision of a satellite centre (linked to Belfast City Hospital) to be located in Altnagelvin.  It will provide the additional radiotherapy capacity needed to meet an anticipated increase in cancer in Northern Ireland.  It also recognises the potential for cross border co-operation in the development of this resource.  I welcomed the announcement by Minister McGimpsesy and officials from my Department and their counterparts in Northern Ireland continue to hold discussions in this regard.  I understand that this facility is expected to be operational by 2015.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	635	There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, speech and language therapy services over the last number of years.  There were a number of issues contributing to difficulties accessing therapy services, one of which had been the supply of qualified personnel available to fill vacant posts.  A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates.  The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the health care needs of the population into the future.  In this regard, since 1997, the number of training places for speech and language therapy has been increased from 25 to 105 which represents an increase of 320%.Almost 130,000 people work full-time or part-time in our public health services.  In recent years, the Government's ongoing high level of investment in health has achieved and maintained significant increases in the numbers of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals employed in the public health services.  The numbers employed in speech and language therapy has also grown significantly, from 282 whole time equivalents employed in December 1997 rising to 750 whole time equivalents employed in December 2008, which represents an increase of 166%.The Government is committed to ensuring continued adequate recruitment of professional staff across a range of community settings to ensure the continued development of community services.  Additional funding of €20 million has been provided in 2009 for health and education services for children with special educational needs.  This funding will provide a total of 125 additional therapy posts in the HSE targeted at children of school-going age. 90 of these will be in the disability services, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, and physiotherapists. 35 additional posts will be provided for child and adolescent mental health services, including clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists for new and existing multi-disciplinary teams.In addition, it is intended that certain key health and social care professional posts, including speech and language therapists, are to be protected by setting employment floors for these grades within the Health Service Executive (HSE) in 2009.  These posts are essential to the development of a number of services areas such as disability (including speech and language therapy), child adolescent mental health services and child protection services.  In order to protect these posts, it is envisaged that the HSE will establish minimum employment levels to be maintained within each of these occupations in the health sector in 2009.  The recruitment and retention of these key front line professional posts is vital to ensure continued progress in the development of community settings.With regard to the number of speech and language therapists appointed to the Tipperary North region, it is a matter for the HSE to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public.  As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

I have no function in this regard.However, as the existing legislative framework for the regulation of the travel trade has been in existence since 1982 in May last year I asked the Commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the travel trade legislation.  The purpose of the review was to assess the operation of the current regulatory arrangements and to recommend any reforms that may be warranted.Following an extensive consultation process, the Commission submitted a report to me on 30 December 2008 which I have published on my Department's website www.transport.ie.I am currently examining the Commission's findings and recommendations and I will also consult with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, on the report's findings in the context of consumer protection policy generally. I will also be meeting the Irish Travel Agents Association tomorrow where there will be a discussion on regulatory reform of the Travel Trade.

More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes units, including the Community Policing Unit. Patrols are supplemented by the Divisional Task Force and Divisional Traffic Units. The Community Policing Unit has lead responsibility for policing in this area and has evolved a partnership approach to problem solving with the community. Members of the Unit maintain contact with the residents of the area concerned and address their concerns.Current policing policy in the area is predicated on the prevention of crime, including crimes of violence against persons and property, the prevention of public order offences and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of the quality of life of the residents. This strategy is, and will continue to be, central to the delivery of the policing service in this area.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	672	Currently the average annual cost of keeping a person in custody is calculated by the Irish Prison Service by dividing the annual running costs of the Irish Prison Service by the average daily number of offenders incarcerated during the year. These costs include certain items which are fixed regardless of the number of offenders in custody, e.g. staffing numbers, utilities and maintenance costs. In general, capital expenditure is excluded from the calculation in the interests of facilitating comparison between individual institutions. However, certain building projects under the heading ‘small works and environmental projects' are included.On that basis the latest available figure of €97,700 relates to the average cost of keeping a prisoner in custody during the calendar year 2007. Using this figure, the weekly average cost of keeping a person in prison during 2007 is approximately €1,875.

To illustrate this point, figures relating to 9 February, 2009 indicate that less than 0.4 percent of the numbers in prison custody fell into this category.  Imprisonment for non-payment of debt was abolished by the Debtors (Ireland) Act 1872.

I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Garda National Drugs Unit on 31 December 2008, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 60.Since the publication of the Government's National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, Garda resources in the fight against illicit drugs have increased.  This is particularly evident with the creation of additional Divisional Drug Units in areas of particular need.  These Drugs Units operate in Divisions throughout the country with a primary focus on local drugs activities.  The total strength of the Divisional Drug Units as at the same date above was 341.Both the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Divisional units are also supported in their work by officers from other national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation. Furthermore, all Gardaí have responsibility, inter alia, to deal with drug related issues as and when they arise.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the total running cost of the Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU) in 2008 was approximately €5.3m.  In addition, the resources used by the Divisional Drugs Units, Divisional Task Force Units and Community Policing Units towards fighting drug crime around the country are estimated at approximately €25m per annum.  The overall Garda budget for this year is €1.589 billion. Priority will continue to be given to frontline policing including targeting resources at serious and organised crime including drug trafficking.In relation to the budgetary provisions for the National Drugs Strategy, the local drugs task forces and the community projects which they support, as the Deputy will appreciate, that is a matter which comes under the remit of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.

At that date, Newport Garda Station formed part of Killaloe Garda District in Clare Garda Division. However, since 1 January 2009 Newport Garda Station forms part of Nenagh Garda District in Tipperary Garda Division.Newport Garda Station is open to the public from 10am to 12.30pm Monday to Friday depending on the rostered tour of duty of members attached to the station and patrols are normally carried out by personnel from that Garda Station. Outside of these times, or in the event of an emergency, members of An Garda Síochána from the District Headquarters in Nenagh carry out patrols in the area referred to and provide an incident response. Additional resources are also available from other units in the Tipperary Division and adjacent Districts and Divisions.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account.

The funding of awards under this scheme was based on 10% of the payroll of the posts covered by the scheme and, within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% could be made to individuals.  However, no payments were made under this scheme in respect of 2008 and, on 5 February last, the Minister for Finance announced that the Government has decided to abolish these bonuses subject to discussions on the implementation of the decision with the relevant staff association.A separate awards scheme has been in place for grades below the level of Assistant Secretary.  The total amount available under this scheme is limited to 0.2% of the Department's payroll from sanctioned subheads.  However, this scheme was effectively suspended in my Department in 2008, in respect of which awards totalling €8,300 were made out of a potential total of €168,000.  No amounts have been set aside in my Department for the payment of awards under either scheme in 2009.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	690	The Government is strongly committed to trying to resolve the plight of the undocumented Irish in the United States.President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and other senior members of the new Administration have for some time been strong supporters of comprehensive immigration reform. Since the new year, there have also been helpful public indications that Senate Majority Leader, Senator Harry Reid, and Senator John McCain intend to support action in this area. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the issue remains politically divisive in the US Congress and making progress will be challenging.The members of the new Administration and Congress are currently taking up office in Washington, and the Government is in the process of establishing substantive contact with them. In doing so, we are building on the extensive work on behalf of the undocumented that the Government has carried out over recent years with many of those now within the Administration.  The Taoiseach, I and other members of Government will use the unique opportunity afforded by the St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the US to engage the new Administration at the very highest level on the situation of the undocumented.Our Ambassador in Washington will continue to attach the highest priority to this issue in his ongoing contacts with the Obama Administration. More broadly, the Government is actively seeking to reform our overall migration arrangements with the United States. In addition to our work on behalf of the undocumented, the Government recently concluded a new Working Holiday Agreement with the United States and is working to secure the passage of legislation which would enable Irish citizens to avail of the E3 working visa currently open to Australians.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	691	I remain deeply concerned by the situation in Tibet. Reports in recent weeks suggest that the Chinese authorities have been engaged in a new security operation in the capital, Lhasa. Some reports indicate that checks on almost 6,000 people have taken place and that around 80 to date have been detained. At the same time, issues relating to the preservation of the religious and cultural identity of Tibetans, the treatment of demonstrators arrested during protests in March 2008 and the wider human rights situation in Tibet remain of concern.The Government continues to convey its concerns about the situation in Tibet directly to the Chinese authorities in our regular contacts with them in Dublin and Beijing and in the context of regular bilateral discussions on human rights issues. Through these contacts, we continue to underline the importance Ireland attaches to the development of a meaningful dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama, so that all issues of concern can be fully addressed. We also strongly support, and engage actively in, EU action in relation to Tibet.I continue to believe that dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama or his representatives remains the most effective way to achieve the protection of Tibetan culture, identity, religion and human rights, and a greater measure of autonomy for Tibet within China.  I am pleased that Tibetans in exile meeting in Dharmasala last November endorsed the principles of autonomy over all-out independence and non-violence over physical confrontation, in the pursuit of their agenda for Tibet. This is very much in line with the course that the Dalai Lama has proposed.However, the current pace and substance of the dialogue between the Dalai Lama and China has been unsatisfactory to date. I call on the Chinese government to re-engage in an accelerated and upgraded dialogue process with the Dalai Lama and his representatives and have consistently stressed this view in our dialogue with the Chinese Government. I would be firmly of the view that positive developments in this dialogue will benefit not only the Tibetan people, but also China itself. It will also serve to curb increasing militancy and demands for secession, particularly from among young Tibetans. These demands diverge from the moderate views of the Dalai Lama, and could be both dangerous and counter-productive, particularly in the course of this emotive year, which marks the fiftieth anniversary of the departure of the Dalai Lama from Tibet in 1949.At EU level, the situation in Tibet is regularly raised in the context of the EU-Human Rights dialogue, to which Ireland contributes. The most recent dialogue took place in Beijing on 28 November 2008 and the situation in Tibet was among the issues discussed.  The Government will continue to monitor carefully the situation in Tibet and it will remain high on the agenda in our contacts with China.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	692	The issue raised by the Deputy is of great importance to me personally and to the large number of host families and organisations who have organised annual visits to Ireland by children from Belarus for over 18 years.My Department became aware of possible restrictions on the children's travel in late August 2008. I met with Adi Roche of Chernobyl Children's Project International on 8 September to review the situation, and also asked the Chargé d'Affaires of the Belarusian Embassy in London to visit Dublin later that week to open discussions on an agreement to provide a framework for visits by Chernobyl children. Intensive discussions with Belarus, at both Ministerial and official level followed.On 8 December 2008, our Ambassador to Belarus, who is based in Moscow, led a delegation comprising officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, to Minsk where they successfully concluded negotiations on a bilateral Agreement on the conditions of rest and recuperation of children from the Republic of Belarus in Ireland.The text of the Agreement was initialled by both parties, and it was agreed that the official signing ceremony would take place as soon as a Presidential Decree issued which would exempt Ireland from the provisions of an earlier Decree relating to future international travel by Belarusian minors. A Protocol to the Agreement was also signed on 8 December, which confirmed that children would be allowed to travel over the Christmas period. I was especially pleased that these visits were able to go ahead, as this was an issue that I had pressed strongly in my contacts with Belarusian Foreign Minister Martynov. I have been gratified by the extremely positive response from the various charities that organised visits to Ireland at that time.Following contact from the Belarus authorities before Christmas, it was expected that the Agreement would be signed on 30 January 2009 in Minsk. However, my Department was informed last week that a Presidential Decree, which is required to be signed in advance of the signing of the Agreement, has yet to issue. For this reason, it did not prove possible to proceed with signature, and it has now been postponed. The Belarusian side also sought some textual changes to the Agreement, and these are being examined at present.My Department is maintaining regular contact with the Belarusian authorities, and we are prepared to sign the Agreement at the earliest opportunity. It is my intention to have the Agreement signed as soon as possible after the required Presidential Decree issues and well in advance of the next round of scheduled visits to Ireland by Chernobyl children next summer. I stand ready to intervene personally, if necessary, to finalise this matter.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	693	The events of the past week, which saw the release of six hostages, including the last politicians to be held by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), are very welcome.The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its commitment to bringing to an end to all terrorism in Colombia within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law. This Law, passed in 2005, provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society. The Justice and Peace Law, which was adopted through a lengthy democratic political process, strikes a difficult balance between peace and justice.The process of peace negotiations between the Colombian Government and the right-wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC) began in 2003, with between 30,000 and 40,000 combatants demobilised by the completion of the process in 2007. Negotiations between the major left-wing guerrilla group, the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), and the Government have not yet commenced.The EU has expressed its total solidarity with the Colombian people, its full support for the Colombian Government in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict and underlined the importance the EU attaches to the ongoing implementation of the Justice and Peace Law.  The EU has further expressed its hope that progress would be made in taking forward negotiations in order to reach a humanitarian agreement, to secure the release of all hostages, to end the armed conflict and to bring lasting peace to Colombia. In the same spirit, the EU has stated that all initiatives taken with the Colombian Government's support with the objective of promoting a successful peace process are welcome.The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. We are fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia, and will continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict, including through direct engagement. We very much welcome the mediation of third parties in the pursuit of a solution to the conflict, where such efforts have the support of the Colombian Government.In conjunction with our EU partners, the Irish government will continue to examine how we may, as appropriate, contribute to the peace process in Colombia.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I propose to take Questions Nos. 375 and 385 together.I am deeply concerned by the escalation in fighting which has taken place in recent months in the northern part of Sri Lanka and by the terrible effects this is having on the local population, including thousands of internally displaced persons.  I am particularly shocked by reports of the repeated shelling last week of the PTK hospital, which has resulted in the deaths of 12 people. While I would wish to see an end to all fighting, I appeal in particular to both the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) not to fire out of, or into the no-fire zone established by the Government or in the vicinity of this or any other hospital.The parties must also allow food and medical assistance to reach those trapped by the fighting. There must be full cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross so as to facilitate the evacuation of urgent medical cases and to ensure the safety of aid and medical workers. Both the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka must respect international humanitarian law. Both must recognise that further loss of life — of civilians and combatants — serves no cause.Bilaterally, and with our EU partners, Ireland has consistently sought to impress on both sides the importance of engaging in meaningful peace talks and stopping all violence and human rights violations. We deeply regret the termination of the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement between the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE last year. We continue to take the firm view that there can be no lasting military solution to Sri Lanka's political difficulties.As one of the four co-chairs of the 2003 Tokyo Conference on the Reconstruction and Development of Sri Lanka, the EU has been anxious to maintain an active role in assisting the country to resolve its internal conflicts, work on national reconciliation and move forward on the development agenda. I fully support the terms of a statement made by the Tokyo Co-Chairs in Colombo on 3 February which calls on the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE to declare a temporary cease-fire to allow for the evacuation of the sick and wounded and for the provision of aid to civilians. I support also the call by the Co-Chairs on the LTTE to discuss with the Government of Sri Lanka the modalities for ending hostilities, including the laying down of arms, the renunciation of violence, the acceptance of the Government of Sri Lanka's offer of amnesty; and for its participation as a political party in a process to achieve a just and lasting political solution.I will continue to make clear the Government's very deep concerns about the situation in Sri Lanka. We will seek compliance by all parties with international humanitarian law and urge the resumption without delay of an inclusive political process. Such a process should address the legitimate concerns and interests of both the main communities on the island. Should the relevant parties seek our advice in relation to a negotiated peace process, we would give consideration as to how we could best help.Ireland will continue to support the efforts of the Co-Chairs, working in concert with the UN and the EU, to address the political and humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka. We hope that an EU Troika visit to Sri Lanka at Ministerial level will take place shortly.  Since 2005, the Government has provided, through Irish Aid, more than €5.3 million for humanitarian and development activities in Sri Lanka, including significant emergency assistance provided in the aftermath of the tsunami in 2004.  In addition, over US$12 million was allocated from the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund to Sri Lanka during 2008. Ireland is currently the seventh largest donor to this Fund.Irish Aid recently provided €7 million in unearmarked funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), one of the key organisations at the centre of the response to the current humanitarian crisis in the north of Sri Lanka.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	695	Most of Ireland's expenditure on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) is provided under Vote 29, International Co-operation.  The programme is administered by the Development Co-operation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, also known as Irish Aid.  Further contributions to ODA are made by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Cooperation Budget.Ireland is the sixth most generous aid donor internationally in per capita terms. The Government's development programme is central to our foreign policy.  In 2009, as in previous years, Ireland will have one of the strongest aid programmes in the world, with a particular focus on the poorest people in the least developed countries in Africa.  We are taking a leadership role internationally on the global hunger crisis, and the aid programme will continue to reflect this priority in 2009 and beyond.Last October, under the Budget for 2009, the Government allocated a total of €891 million for ODA.  Of this, €754 million was provided under Vote 29 with a further €137 million being contributed by other Government Departments and through the EU Development Cooperation Budget.As the Deputy will be aware, the Government last week took the difficult decision to reduce the total ODA budget for 2009 to €796 million.  The decision was taken as part of the determined effort to curb public expenditure in order to establish a platform for the resumption of strong economic growth, and further expansion of the Government's development programme in years to come.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	696	As noted in my response to the Deputy's previous question about a visa for this individual (PQ 1008/09) I am not in a position to support individual visa applications.It is the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather than my own Department which has primary responsibility for visa and immigration policy and, in particular, for making decisions on individual visa applications where there is a previous history of an asylum application or deportation as would appear to be the case in this instance.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I propose to take Questions Nos. 378 and 379 together.Universal access to reproductive health is one of the goals of the Programme of Action agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994.  In addition, the fifth Millennium Development Goal is to (a) reduce by three-quarters the maternal mortality ratio and (b) achieve universal access to reproductive health, by 2015.  The Government is committed to action in support of this goal, which is also important in tackling HIV and AIDS.The Government's 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid outlines our commitment to supporting the specific health needs of women within our overall approach to health in developing countries.  It makes clear that addressing women's health needs, particularly in the areas of basic healthcare and maternal and reproductive health, must lie at the heart of an effective overall response to improving health in developing countries.Unfortunately, only limited progress has been made on this issue since the Cairo Conference in 1994.  Every year, some 500,000 women die and a further 10 million suffer from severe illnesses or disabilities as a result of complications in pregnancy and childbirth.  Underlying this tragedy is the lack of access by women in developing countries to good quality maternal and reproductive health, including family planning.The Government, through Irish Aid, works with several partner agencies in the UN system to address maternal health issues.  One of the main obstacles to the achievement of universal access to reproductive health is the lack of empowerment of women in developing countries.  The issues involved form the core mandate of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), with which Irish Aid has a close relationship.In recognition of its important mandate, the Government has contributed substantially to the core funding of UNFPA in recent years — €2.9 million in 2005, €3.1 million in 2006, €4.5 million in 2007 and €4.5 million in 2008.  In 2006 the Government also contributed €0.5 million to the UNFPA Trust Fund for Global Reproductive Health Commodities Security, with further contributions of €1 million in 2007 and €1 million in 2008.  In 2007, we also contributed €2 million to the UNFPA Trust Fund on Maternal Health, €0.5 million to the Fistula Thematic Trust Fund and €0.5 million to a joint UNFPA and UNICEF project on Female Genital Mutilation.  In total, over the three years 2005-2008, Ireland has contributed €20.5 million to UNFPA.In recognition of the importance of its work on gender, reproductive health, maternal mortality and HIV and AIDS, Ireland is one of five international donors to have signed a multi-annual framework agreement with UNFPA to recognise shared objectives and ensure predictable funding for the years 2008-2011.

The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following tables for both Votes.I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on such expenditure.  The Department commissions external advisory services only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), where ongoing independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.  Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, I am satisfied that this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.I should add that, in accordance with the Government decision of July 2008, the budgetary provision for consultancies in my Department has been reduced by 50% in 2009 over the 2008 allocation.ConsultantsContract DetailsPeriod 1/1/2008-14/10/2008Period 15/10/2008-5/2/2009€€Cornwell ConsultantsTechnical Advice on Preparation of Specifications for Support and Maintenance of the Automated Passport System12,2510PA ConsultingGeneral ICT Consultancy1,8150RITSICT Security Consultancy79,42785,762Millward Brown IMSResearch survey on the outcome of the EU Reform Treaty Referendum138,0610The Communications ClinicDevelopment of a Communication Action Plan under the Communicating Europe Initiative041,000Long Road Productions Ltd.Cultural Events Coordination and Advisory Services for State and Official Visits5,80816,456Farrell Grant SparksReview of Departmental Structures24,2000KPMGValue For Money Study — Passport Service35,9780ConsultantsContract DetailsPeriod

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	699	During 2008, the Department of Foreign Affairs implemented the following schemes involving awards to staff: the Scheme of Performance Related Pay Awards and the Exceptional Performance Awards Scheme.Scheme of Performance Related Pay AwardsThe Scheme of Performance Related Pay Awards in the Civil Service applies to Deputy and Assistant Secretaries and equivalent grades.  It does not apply to Secretaries General.In 2008, a total of €656,000 was paid under this scheme.  The payments made related to the performance of 48 officers during the preceding calendar year. These payments were subject to tax and PRSI.  The awards were made by the Committee for Performance Awards, chaired by the Secretary General for Public Service Management and Development in the Department of Finance, following recommendations by the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Details of the operation of the Performance Related Pay Awards scheme are available in the annual reports of the Committee for Performance Awards.  The Committee's April 2008 report can be accessed on the website of the Department of Finance at the following link:  http://www.finance.gov.ie/documents/publications/reports/2008/cpareport07final.pdf    No payments have been made in 2009 in respect of performance in 2008.Exceptional Performance AwardsUnder the Department of Foreign Affairs' Administrative Budget Agreement with the Department of Finance, a fund amounting to 0.2% of the Department's salaries budget has been made available each year to the Secretary General in respect of ex-gratia payments or other awards to individual staff members or groups of staff, by way of recognition of exceptional performance of duty.In 2008, a total of €156,500 was paid to 309 staff under this scheme, which is administered by a sub-group of the Department's Partnership Committee.  The sub-group assesses nominations for merit awards and makes recommendations to the Secretary General of the Department.  The objective of the scheme is to reward cases of genuinely exceptional performance by officers in grades up to and including Counsellor/Principal Officer level.The Exceptional Performance fund also provides for officers in the Department with at least 25 years' experience to receive an award in recognition of their long service.  This award comprises a gift of €250 along with a special commemorative coin.  In 2008, a total of €18,840 was spent in providing such Long Service Awards to 66 officers.No decision has yet been taken on the payment of Exceptional Performance Awards or Long Service Awards in 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	700	I propose to take Questions Nos. 382 and 383 together.Section 10 of the Passports Act 2008 provides that a passport issued under the Act "shall be in the name of the applicant as it appears in his or her certificate of birth (whether in the English language or the Irish language) or, as may be appropriate, a certificate of naturalisation or other document produced by him or her to the Minister as evidence of Irish citizenship."There are a number of exceptions to this general rule. Under Section 10(2), a passport may be issued in a new name following marriage. Section 10(4) permits the issuing of a passport in a name other than the name on the certificate of birth, where the applicant provides satisfactory evidence of the use of the new name over a period of at least two years prior to the date of application.In cases where satisfactory evidence over a two year period is not provided, Section 10(5) permits the Minister to issue a passport in a new name.  However, in such cases, the name on the certificate of birth or other evidence of citizenship is entered as an observation in the passport and must remain there for a period of not less than two years.The inclusion of an observation regarding a previous name helps to avoid difficulties that may arise, for example, when a person is applying for visas or work permits abroad, due to the name on his or her passport differing from the name entered on a certificate of birth or previous passport.  Although its inclusion is optional in the case of applicants who have the required two years satisfactory evidence of usage of the new name, in accordance with Section 10(5), it is a requirement in the case of applications where such evidence is not provided.Accordingly, where a person has an Irish birth certificate with a name recorded in the English language, he or she may apply for a passport in his or her name in the Irish language by providing satisfactory evidence of usage of that form of the name.  This provision also extends to cases where a person seeks a passport in the English form of the name but the certificate of birth shows the name in the Irish language.The nature of evidence of use of a new name will depend on an individual's circumstances.  Typically, where an applicant is under age 18, proofs of use would include bank or savings account details, school records and reports or a letter from the family doctor certifying that the applicant is registered with the practice in the name in which the application is made.In regard to the case outlined by the Deputy, the individual in question has the option, as indicated above, of applying for a new passport in the Irish version of his/her name.  This can be granted provided that the applicant can show proof of usage for two years.  If this is not available, it will be necessary to include the English version of the name as an observation on the passport for at least two years.

The programme is administered by the Development Co-operation Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, also known as Irish Aid.  Further contributions to ODA are made by other Government Departments and through Ireland's allocation to the EU Development Cooperation budget.During the 2008 estimates process the Government allocated a total of €914 million to ODA.  In light of the changed economic situation, the Government reviewed current expenditure allocations in July 2008.  In the course of this review, the overall ODA allocation was revised to €899 million.  Of this, €769 million was allocated under Vote 29, with an additional estimated €130 million contributed by other Government Departments.  The Vote 29 allocation was fully utilised and, while the out-turn figure for other ODA has not yet been finalised, it is expected that it will be close to the €130 million estimate.Through Irish Aid, the Government provides assistance to more than 90 countries in the developing world, with a strong focus on the least developed countries and Africa.  Nine countries have been designated as Programme Countries, with a commitment to long term strategic assistance.  They are Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia and Timor Leste.  In 2008, the total funding allocated to programme assistance in these nine countries amounted to €218.8 million.  A breakdown of these allocations is set out as follows.A detailed analysis of all expenditure in 2008 under Vote 29 is now being prepared.  It will be published later this year in the 2008 Irish Aid Annual Report.Country2008 Allocation

Over 7,400 projects providing a range of essential sports facilities have now benefited from sports capital funding since 1998 bringing the total allocation in that time to over €725 million.  In 2008 over €50m was allocated towards 685 separate sports facility and equipment projects, including allocations of €1.778 million to 25 tennis projects. These grants continue to play a pivotal role in ensuring the provision of modern, high quality facilities around Ireland that attract more people to participate in sporting activities.In the 2009 Estimates, €56m has been provided in my Department's vote to cover payments to be made from the C-1 sub-head, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.  As I announced in the House recently no decision has been taken about the timing of future rounds of the Programme.

However, my Department did not establish these Groups.  These Groups would have been selected as part of a general call for proposals to deliver the LEADER Programmes.I understand that these companies may also have had access to private and other sources of public funding.  In the context of the changes now underway arising from the Cohesion process, my Department is in contact with the companies concerned to ensure protection of the state's interest in any assets which were acquired or developed with the assistance of state support.

Accordingly, revised administration funding arrangements were put in place to ensure that Groups, who had exhausted their original Programme administration allocation, continued to be in a position to carry out this work.  Project activity under the Programmes ended for the majority of Groups in March 2008, at which stage the significant work required to close the Programmes commenced.The funding provided did not meet the full administration costs of the Groups, but was a contribution to their core costs.  The total amount provided under the revised arrangements amounted to approx. to €17.7m, covering the period from January 2007 until the commencement of the new Rural Development Programme in 2009.

I am not in a position to inform the Deputy, however, how many of these enterprises are still in operation or how many are likely to continue in operation in the coming years.  The LEADER Programmes do not provide ongoing financial support to these enterprises, rather support is generally granted towards the capital costs associated with the start-up or expansion of such enterprises.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that under Rural Development Programme Ireland 2007-2013 funding of €48m will be available under the Business Creation and Development measure of the Programme.35 Local Action Groups and 3 collective bodies were selected, on the basis of a competitive process, to deliver the LEADER Programmes 2000-2006.For the delivery of Axis 3 & 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007–2013, using the LEADER approach, 36 Local Action Groups have been selected. Twelve of  these are integrated LEADER/Partnership companies which operated under previous LEADER Programmes,  while the others are newly integrated companies.

In general, a contribution to the cost of managers is not made unless a compelling case has been advanced.  The last call for proposals under the Community Halls and Facilities Strand of the Programme was made in mid-2008 and I have already announced decisions in relation to this strand. Some of these are outstanding. Given the current economic circumstances, I have previously stated that it is unlikely that a call for new proposals will be possible for the foreseeable future.At the end of 2008 some 423 projects have been approved for funding at a cost of some €48.5m.  Projects fall within three broad categories, namely, the operation of community halls and facilities; the delivery of services not otherwise provided locally, and support for community enterprise opportunities.  The number of people that will be employed by these projects is estimated to reach 2,600 by the end of 2009.  Further proposals under the 2008 Calls are being examined and I hope to receive recommendations over the next few weeks.

My Department manages a number of measures that provide support for priority projects in RAPID areas, for a substance misuse programme and for recreation and personal development grants for disadvantaged young people.Details of the individual grants and organisations that have been approved for support from the Fund are available on the Department's website www.pobail.ie and a county-by-county breakdown is provided.From an examination of the measures that my Department manages, the position in relation to projects in Co. Tipperary is as follows: in relation to Round 1 of the DAF (2004/2005) — which were approved by the former Dormant Accounts Disbursements Board — approval was given for some €1.3 million in projects; in excess of €450,000 in funding was approved for projects under Round 2 (2006); and Round 3 (2007) approvals totalled some €360,000.The indicative allocations for funding under the RAPID additionality and substance misuse measures were agreed by Government in March 2008.  The actual beneficiaries of these allocations will be approved in the coming months.During 2009, it is anticipated that funding of some €13 million will be provided through the Vote of my Department in relation to the DAF measures that it manages. However, as projects will continue to be approved as the year progresses, it is not possible to estimate, in advance, the level of funding which will be provided to projects in Co. Tipperary.

The CLÁR programme is constantly addressing the new challenges faced by small rural communities and is being continuously refocused to deal with the most urgent infrastructural deficits especially in the current economic climate.To date only one application for funding has been received from South Tipperary in 2009.  This application is for funding under the CLÁR Primary School Outdoor Play Facilities Enhancement Scheme. A decision will be made in the case as soon as possible and the Deputy will be informed of the outcome.RAPIDThe RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 46 designated RAPID areas.  In addition, the RAPID leverage schemes support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.My Department is currently assessing three claims under the RAPID Leverage Schemes for RAPID areas in South Tipperary: one claim under the Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement Scheme for Clonmel; one claim under the Playgrounds Scheme for Clonmel and one claim under the Playgrounds Scheme for Carrick-on-Suir.  It is expected that these will be paid in 2009 if the claims are found to be in order.Applications for funding under the Physical Environment Improvement Scheme closed on Friday last, January 30th.

In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section (http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID).

If paid in 2009 these claims will amount to €147,750.However, given that the RAPID Leverage Scheme is a demand-led, bottom-up funding programme, it is not possible to predict accurately the extent of claims that will be lodged by RAPID areas in South Tipperary during 2009. However, I am satisfied that this year's allocation will be sufficient to enable further good progress to be made with small-scale co-funded projects in the South Tipperary RAPID areas.

In addition to this funding, the Task Force was also approved €75,000 in 2008 under the Cocaine Initiative to employ a number of sessional facilitators to provide programmes to those affected by cocaine use. A further €20,000 was also allocated under this Initiative to run a locally-based cocaine awareness campaign to dovetail with the HSE-led national campaign.With regard to capital funding, the NERDTF has been approved funding of nearly €1.65m for four projects under the Premises Initiative. This Fund aims to address the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects in Task Force areas.  Details of the approvals are in the following table.In addition, in 2008, the NERDTF was approved funding for two projects valued at nearly €570,000 under the Regional Youth Initiative.  This initiative provided capital funding for the development of dedicated youth facilities in Regional Drugs Task Force areas not covered under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF). Key to approvals was the linking of projects into the overall drug prevention strategy for their particular area. Details of the approvals are in the table.  Overall, I am satisfied that the incremental funding allocated to the NERDTF has enabled the Task Force to develop key services in their area and I am confident that the progress made to date will be built on over the coming years.€South Meath Response, Unit 1&2 Eamonn Duggan Industrial Estate, Athboy Road, Trim, Co.

Under this scheme, operated by the Department of Finance, the Central Committee for Performance Awards considers recommendations made by Secretaries General. Awards of €41,000 were made in 2008 in respect of performance in 2007, in accordance with the guidelines and rules governing the scheme. This total amount covered three Assistant Secretaries in my Department.I can confirm that my Department has made no provision for bonus payments in 2009 and it is not envisaged that any such payments will be made during the year in respect of 2008.For the sake of completeness, I should add that my Department also operated a Merit Award scheme in 2008. Under this scheme, and in accordance with my Department's agreed Administrative Budget, a total of 0.2% of the payroll allocation may be made available to staff in recognition of exceptional contribution or performance by individuals or teams. In 2008, a total of €12,950 (which was less than 43% of the available funds under the scheme) was awarded to teams across my Department in respect of performance during the year. No individual awards were made.No specific provision has been made for a Merit Award scheme in 2009 and I anticipate that the matter will be discussed at my Department's Partnership Committee in the coming weeks.

She is assessed with means of €251.71 per week derived from income from her spouse's insurable employment.  She was notified of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.On 1 December 2008 she appealed this decision and an appeal is open in this case.  Her file will be submitted to the Social Welfare Appeals Office this week.Under Social Welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These Officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim. The occupational injuries scheme, operated by the Department, provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease. In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.If the incapacity extends beyond the 26 week period, claimants may receive illness benefit or invalidity pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.Miners may also be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries scheme. Disablement benefit is a compensation payment specifically for those who suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work. Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	727	The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of my Department.  Over 600 staff at local, regional and national level are engaged on a full or part-time basis on work related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system.Customers in receipt of social welfare payments are reviewed on an ongoing basis to verify continued compliance with requirements such as, in the case of jobseekers payments, being available for and genuinely seeking employment. Means tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department.In relation to cross-border control, procedures are in place to deal with ongoing referrals, fraud and non-fraud in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the UK.  People who move from Northern Ireland to Ireland may have an entitlement to a social welfare payment. However, if there is any suspicion of a fraud being perpetrated, this is investigated by local Social Welfare Inspectors.A Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland was signed in October 2000.  Under the aegis of the MOU, the Cross- Border Operations Forum assists and directs activities relating to the investigation of social security benefit fraud with a cross border dimension.  It undertakes individual fraud investigations and larger projects and shares best practice in counter fraud operations.Due to operational sensitivities the Department cannot release information regarding the specifics of control activities that target cross border fraud.Where overpayments occur the Department seeks to recover the overpayments and in cases of serious fraud, the Department will use all legal avenues open to it to recover the money defrauded and seek redress.In 2008 almost €476 million in social welfare payments was saved through fraud and error control measures which is an increase of €29 million on the previous year.At the end 2008, 357 cases of social welfare fraud were forwarded to the Chief State Solicitors Office for the initiation of prosecution proceedings.The Department is committed to  ensuring that  social welfare  payments  are available  to  those  who  are  entitled  to  them but also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected.  In this regard the control programme of the Department is carefully monitored and the various measures are continuously refined to ensure that they remain effective.

A fundamental qualifying condition for the benefit is that a person must be available for full-time work.Under the Unemployment Benefit system a week is considered to be six days. Sunday is not considered part of the working week and any work done on Sunday is not reckoned when deciding entitlement.The benefit is only payable in respect of days of unemployment, therefore it is not payable in respect of any day during which the person is engaged in insurable employment irrespective of the extent of the employment (number of hours worked), or the remuneration, or profit. Where a person is employed for up to three days in a week, s/he may claim Jobseeker's Benefit in respect of the remainder of the week, subject to being available for full-time work.In this context, the development of any scheme involving local authorities would be a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the first instance.The application of the jobseekers payment scheme conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis is being kept under review.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	729	The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as expeditiously as possible.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands.Applicants for invalidity pension do not automatically switch from another social welfare payment.  The processing of these applications involves medical assessment, verification of domestic and EU social insurance contributions and other criteria, all of which add to the processing time required to ensure that the terms of the scheme are correctly administered.  In addition, time can elapse where applicants do not attend for medical assessments or do not supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.The Department received 7,757 invalidity pension applications in 2008 and 7,596 were decided in the year.  The average time to decide an invalidity pension award was 11 weeks.  A review of existing processes and procedures for invalidity pension is currently underway with the explicit objective of improving efficiency in claim processing.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The Department of Social and Family Affairs offers a range of education and employment supports designed to assist and facilitate people on social welfare payments to return to the active labour force.The back to education allowance (BTEA) is the main education support scheme of the Department. It is designed to encourage people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to work. An applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period, to qualify for the back to education allowance. This requirement has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need. The allowance essentially replaces a person's existing social welfare income and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. In addition, the qualifying period for access to the third level option is further reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.FÁS Employment Service helps job-seekers, in particular those who are most marginalised, to enter or re-enter the active labour market. Job-seekers who are considered to be distant from the labour market are provided with appropriate and intensive professional vocational guidance which results in an action plan setting out specific actions and measures to be implemented with a view to helping them integrate into the labour force.FÁS provides various financial supports in the form of allowances to assist participants on training courses and grants or subventions to encourage employers to support training programmes. Participants on the majority of FÁS training courses are eligible for various allowances. The main allowances given for the course participants are training, travel, accommodation, meals and child care.FÁS operates a National Contact Centre which may be contacted, by job-seekers, using a free-phone number to obtain information on jobs available and on FÁS training and employment programmes. For information on the full range of allowances and grants and advice on their personal options a person should contact their local FÁS office.

The legislative provision to give effect to the Government's decision is contained in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2008. An implementation plan for the smooth integration of the two bodies is underway and it is envisaged that the new division will commence operations from 1st July.The new division will provide a unified institutional structure to support government, officials and the wider community in addressing issues of poverty and social exclusion. It will play a central role in co-ordinating the ongoing development and implementation of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion in collaboration with the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion, government departments, local authorities and agencies.  Key functions will include policy advice, research, data availability, communications, poverty impact assessment and the strengthening of social inclusion strategies.In the meantime both organisations continue to operate separately, but are in the process of integrating their operations. There are currently 20 permanent staff employed in the Combat Poverty Agency (17.6 full time equivalent posts) in grades analogous to Civil Service grades as follows — 6 Assistant Principals, 8 Higher Executive Officers, 2 Executive Officers and 4 Clerical Officers. In addition, there are seven people on either fixed term or temporary contracts that are due to be completed in the coming months.  The Department's 2009 Grant-in-Aid provision for the Combat Poverty Agency is €4.088m of which some  €2.4m is attributable to the Board and staff costs and the administration costs. The remainder relates mainly to programme funding under headings that include projects, communications and research.There are currently ten staff members working in the Office for Social Inclusion as follows; Director, Principal Officer, 2 Assistant Principals, 5 Higher Executive/Administrative Officers and 1 Clerical Officer. The costs associated with the Office mainly relate to staff costs and are accounted for as part of the overall administrative budget of the Department.As part of the integration process, both bodies are drawing up integrated business plans for the year and a strategic plan for the new division for the next 3 years.  These plans will determine the deployment of staff and the budget for the new division in the second half of this year and in future years. It is expected that the new arrangements will yield savings, especially in areas such as accommodation and efficiencies that can be gained through combined payroll and ancillary support services.

There are 53 independent companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local services throughout the country.  In 2009 almost €18 million has been provided to fund the service. Additional full and part time staff have been allocated to 6 MABS offices bringing to 252 the number of money advice staff employed in the MABS. This will ensure that people in debt seeking advice on their personal finances can access that advice promptly.There are three ways that members of the public can receive the assistance, support and advice they need from MABS — through the MABS Telephone Helpline lo-call number 1890 283 438 available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday, the 52 MABS companies nationwide operating in 65 locations delivering the locally based face to face service and the MABS website www.mabs.ie. In the period to the end of January 2009 1,552 new clients approached the MABS. In addition, 262 people sought information about budgeting and money management and the MABS National Helpline dealt with approx 2,030 calls. The detailed statistical breakdown of clients per centre for the months January 2009, January 2008, and January 2007 requested by the Deputy is not available.  However nationally in January 2007 1,817 new clients approached the MABS. The corresponding figure for January 2008 was 1,210 new clients. In addition 906 callers were dealt with by the MABS National Helpline which was launched in October 2007.Overall in 2008 some 16,600 new clients were seen by MABS. An additional 2,400 sought information about budgeting and money management from the local services and the MABS National Helpline received almost 11,000 calls.

Jobseeker's Allowance (JA) is a means-tested scheme, which means that the person must satisfy qualifying conditions and pass a means test to see if he/she qualifies for payment.The person concerned is self-employed as a taxi driver since 2004.  He advised the Social Welfare Inspector in December 2008 that he was off sick for 3 months during 2008 and he claims that he last worked on 15 November 2008.  He has not kept accounts for 2007 or 2008.  He has insurance for his taxi up until April 2009.  He agreed that he can continue to work as a self-employed taxi driver whenever he wishes.  There has been no suggestion made that he has to dispose of his taxi plate.  Accordingly, he is being assessed as a self-employed taxi driver.His JA claim has been disallowed.  The Local Office wrote to him on 10 December 2008 to advise him that his weekly means have been assessed at €300. As his weekly means were greater than the weekly rate of payment due for JA at that time, that is, €197.80, he was advised that he is not entitled to a JA payment.  He was advised that he could appeal this decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.   He has now submitted an appeal and this is being processed at present.It is open to the person concerned to claim Supplementary Welfare Allowance if he feels that his income is insufficient for his needs.

Recommendations in relation to awards are made by the Secretary General of each department and the operation of the scheme is overseen by the Committee for Performance Awards.  The funding for awards is based on 10% of the payroll for the posts covered by the scheme. Within this overall limit, payments of up to 20% can be made to individuals.Details of the procedures, the numbers covered by the scheme, the range of awards and the total amounts paid in Departments are outlined in the annual reports of the Committee (available on the website www.finance.gov.ie).  The Committee does not identify the amount paid to individuals as this is regarded as personal information.No specific provision has been made for this scheme in 2009.  In addition, there is a scheme for Recognition of Exceptional Performance by Staff which operates across the Civil Service.  This scheme has been in operation since 1996 and allows Secretaries-General to make awards for sustained exceptional performance to staff.  Awards may be made in respect of performance above the level which would reasonably be expected in the normal course from the grade of staff involved.  All staff in the Department, irrespective of grade, can nominate another staff member or a team for an award, at any time during the year.The total gross expenditure on the scheme, which in my Department is called the Fiúntas scheme, was €176,780 in 2008.  Total gross expenditure on the scheme in 2009 will depend on the decisions made during the year in relation to nominations for recognition of exceptional performance but in any event, as in previous years, the total expenditure on the scheme in 2009 may not exceed 0.2% of payroll costs.

I appreciate that becoming unemployed is a very difficult time in a person's life and that they need to get access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible.The Navan Social Welfare Local Office is staffed by employees of the Department.  It is a relatively new office and there are no specific physical building constraints that have or that will prevent the allocation of additional staff resources there.Additionally, internal renovations within that office are due to be undertaken shortly which will provide additional working space.  Having regard to the increased live register and service demands, an additional four staff have been allocated to Navan Local Office, with a further 2 to be allocated.  This will bring the total number of staff in the office to 30.The offices in Trim and Kells are Branch Offices operated by private individuals on a contract basis.  Within the terms of their contracts, branch managers are required to provide adequate staffing and suitable accommodation to allow the efficient performance of the work of the office.  The Department reviews the provision of accommodation and staffing in branch offices from time to time of these offices under the terms and conditions of these contracts.  The arrangements in the Trim and Kells offices are being kept under review.

Each Branch Office is operated, under a contract for services, by a Branch Manager who acts as an agent for the Department in the district served by the Branch Office.The method of remuneration for Branch Managers is agreed at the Branch Managers' Conciliation Council, which includes officials from the Department and representatives of the Branch Managers' Association, and is subject to approval by the Department of Finance.Under current arrangements, payments made to Branch Managers comprise a basic payment, a Variable Costs Allowance and a Tiered Services Allowance. The rate of Variable Costs and Tiered Services Allowances payable are dependent on claim load and as such can differ from Office to Office.All newly appointed Branch Managers are appointed on an initial twelve month contract.  Subject to the provision of satisfactory service a permanent contract to age 65 may be awarded. In some instances specific time bound contracts have also been awarded.  There is provision in all contracts for the review of arrangements for delivery of services.Under the conditions of their contract, each Branch Manager is required to provide sufficient staffing to allow for the efficient performance of the work of the Office.Branch Managers are subject to an annual performance appraisal by the Department.  Performance levels are measured in relation to efficiency and effectiveness, customer service and the quality of work.

The operation of the scheme is overseen by the Committee for Performance Awards (CPA). Details of awards to individual officers under the scheme are not disclosed on the basis that they are confidential to the officer concerned. However, I can say that during 2008 awards totalling €22,000 were made to two officers in my Department.The Scheme for Performance Related Awards also applies to officers of the Permanent Defence Force at the level of Brigadier General and Major General.  In 2008 an amount of €125,900 was paid to a total of 11 personnel under this scheme.In respect of 2009, no awards have been authorised for payment under this scheme.Performance awards for other civil service grades are made to individual staff members and to groups of staff under a scheme for Recognition of Exceptional Performance of duty. In assessing eligibility for awards, regard is given to the nature and quality of the activities involved and to the circumstances under which they were carried out. Attention is also paid to the grade level of the staff members concerned and to what would be regarded as high quality performance from staff in such grades.  In 2008, two individual awards of €700 each, one individual award of €400 and 7 individual awards of €200 each have been made. In 2008 there were 419 members of staff across all grades up to and including Principal Officer level eligible for consideration for an award under the scheme.  No amount has been set aside in 2009 under the scheme for Recognition of Exceptional Performance awards.

In a complex judgment delivered in June 2005, the Court deemed that the refusal was ultra vires the powers of the Minister. Following legal advice, it was decided to appeal the High Court decision to the Supreme Court which held that the State’s appeal should be dismissed.Costs of the Judicial Review and Supreme Court challenge were awarded to the licence applicant. A settlement of €343,940.05 (High Court €248,248.41; Supreme Court €95,691.64) was subsequently agreed, and paid over to the applicant in December 2008. Information on the cost of the State's legal representation in the cases is a matter for the Chief State Solicitors Office, and is not available in my Department.

The issues involved are complex and required detailed consideration. This process has included discussions with a number of organisations, bodies, public agencies and interests active in this area. As indicated in the reply to question No. 1045 of 27 January 2009, it is my intention to introduce amending legislation in this area which will address a number of issues relating to dog breeding establishments.  My proposals in this regard will be published as soon as possible and will complement measures being prepared by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the area of animal welfare and health.

Where a planning permission expires, the developer may seek an extension of the relevant period. Subject to compliance with certain requirements, including the requirement that substantial works were carried out pursuant to the permission during that period, a planning authority may extend the duration of a permission by such additional period as it considers necessary to enable the relevant development to be completed. This period may be further extended where the planning authority is satisfied that the relevant development had not been completed due to circumstances beyond the control of the developer.On the particular issue of Wind Farm development, my Department also issued the Wind Energy Development Guidelines in June 2006. A copy of the Guidelines is available on my Department's website www.environ.ie. The Guidelines offer advice to planning authorities on planning for wind energy through the development plan process and in determining applications for planning permission, including the duration of the planning permission itself. The relevant provisions of these guidelines were restated in Circular Letter PD3/08 issued on 16 July 2008.  While I consider that these provisions are adequate they will be reviewed in the context of the forthcoming Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.

Information is also published in my Department’s Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  Data for the third quarter of 2008 will be published shortly.Comprehensive information on the average cost price of affordable homes acquired by local authorities and the number of units sold was not collected by my Department in 2006-2007.At the end of 2007, information supplied by local authorities indicated that the number of units on hands at that time was of the order of 2,200.  Such data were not collected in 2006.  It is a feature of the operation of the affordable housing schemes that individual authorities ordinarily have a certain quantum of completed affordable homes on hands at any given time, principally comprising units either being prepared for, or in the course of, sale.  However, the information available from local authorities would suggest that the strong level of affordable housing delivery in 2008 and wider housing and mortgage market considerations are combining to increase the stock of homes on hands.  The indications to date are that the number of affordable units on hands nationally is in the region of 2,500 to 3,000 units.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	759	I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 to 452, inclusive, together.Statutory responsibility for the making of agreements under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2007 rests with the relevant planning authority.An agreement under Part V may provide for, inter alia, the developer building and transferring completed houses to the planning authority.  The number and description of the houses will be specified in the agreement and the homes will be transferred at a price determined on the basis of the site cost of the units, calculated at existing use value together with the building and development costs, including profits, as agreed between both parties.It is open to a planning authority to accept fewer units at a lower cost price — in effect, cost subsidisation — so long as it achieves the equivalent monetary value which would have accrued had the agreement provided solely for the transfer of land.  The housing yield under each Part V agreement is a matter for individual authorities to negotiate, having regard to the various considerations set out in legislation.In the case referred to, the local authority has advised that the required equivalent monetary value due to it under Part V was secured.  It is open to local authorities to further reduce the purchase price of affordable homes, where appropriate, from a value for money perspective, where this is necessary to continue to meet the needs of the target group concerned.

The pilot schemes will test the use of biodegradable and/or colour coded plastic ties; the display of posters in designated areas only; restricting the total number of posters per candidate; restricting the number of posters per candidate to 2 (back to back) per pole.Details on participating local authorities will shortly be finalised and the specific detail of the pilot schemes will be agreed on an individual basis with each of the local authorities involved.  It is my intention to ask all candidates, local and European, in each of the participating areas to participate in the scheme so that it is as comprehensive and representative as possible.I am also reviewing the litter legislation to ensure there is absolutely no doubt that posters cannot be erected before an election has been called, and I will bring forward an amendment if necessary.

I intend to have the limits in place for the local elections to be held in June 2009.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to examine spending limits at local elections as part of the Green Paper on Local Government. Submissions made in the course of preparing the Green Paper, published in April 2008, were generally supportive of some kind of expenditure limit.In October 2008, I consulted the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on the issue of spending limits.  A policy research document prepared on behalf of the Committee and presented at that meeting offered useful practical guidance.  There are a number of complexities that need to be considered.  I discussed these with members of the Committee, and I have taken them into account in the preparation of the scheme of spending limits.

Of this, training costs amount to €272,500.  Responsibility for the security and safe storage of manual voting electoral materials, such as ballot boxes, stamping instruments and stationery, has been a matter for the Returning Officers, who are statutorily responsible for conducting the polls.  Accordingly, similar responsibility was assigned to them for the storage of the electronic voting machines and equipment.  Based on figures received in my Department from Returning Officers, the total annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment, including the cost of insurance, service charges, rates and heating, for 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were €658,000; €696,000; €706,000; €489,000; and €204,000, respectively.  In 2007, over 60% of the electronic voting machines, some 4,762 in total, were moved to a central storage facility located at Gormanston Army Camp.  Costs incurred to date in respect of the movement and storage of this equipment are €328,000.  These are largely one-off costs related to the preparation of the facility, transportation of the machines and the acquisition of storage containers.I am considering the next steps to be taken on the electronic voting and counting project.  In this regard, I am taking into account the work of the Commission on Electronic Voting, which has examined the system, relevant experiences and developments internationally, the need to maintain public confidence in the electoral process, as well as the provisions in the programme for Government relating to electoral reform generally.  Given the scale of investment in the system to date, and the importance of the issues involved for our electoral system, it is essential that the future of the project be examined objectively and in a thorough and comprehensive manner.  It is important that we come to the best possible decision.  It is not possible to make more specific comment at this point on the project itself, or on future plans for the machines, pending completion of the necessary work and a decision by the Government in the matter.

The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this.  In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges and any associated waiver scheme is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider.  Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  I have no statutory function in the determination of charges or waivers.  Significant regulatory issues have emerged as waste management services have rapidly evolved in recent years.  These issues, which have been the subject of formal public consultation, include the need for appropriate reflection of necessary public service criteria in relation to the provision of services in particular areas or in respect of specific households.  The existing regulatory framework requires modernisation.  The identification of the changes necessary will be greatly assisted by the OECD review of the public service, which included a specific case study on waste management, and will be implemented in the context of the overall review of national waste management policy provided for in the Programme for Government and now under way.  My Department has also recently received the report by the Ombudsman of waste waiver schemes administered by local authorities.  It is giving the report, particularly the recommendations contained in it, full consideration.  The revised approach to the collection of household waste being taken by the Dublin local authorities will further inform what measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste collection services, whether delivered by the private or public sectors.  In these contexts, the appropriate policy responses will be developed and elaborated.

The objective of the pilot programme is to evaluate new approaches to meeting the wastewater collection and treatment needs of rural communities and to examine the potential role for group sewerage schemes in extending collection systems to households outside the catchment of new or existing public sewerage networks.  The performance of new infrastructure provided under the pilot programme is being monitored and evaluated.  The National Rural Water Services Committee has been asked to report to me on the results as they become available.  The grants for group sewerage schemes will be reviewed in light of the outcome.

Furthermore, affordable housing sold at a discount from market value contains a clawback provision.

While the Government has been careful to ensure that the process of correction in the housing market is not artificially interfered with, a number of steps have been taken to ensure that in so far as possible mortgage finance is available to households who want to buy or build houses at this time.In this regard the Government announced the introduction of a new mortgage scheme in the context of Budget 2009. The Home Choice Loan has been introduced through the local authority system, backed by loan finance raised by the Housing Finance Agency.  Home Choice Loan is now available to first time buyers of new houses or self-builds, subject to a maximum loan of €285,000 or max LTV of 92% (whichever is the lesser) and income thresholds. The Regulations to underpin the scheme were signed in December and the scheme commenced on 1 January 2009.In addition, the Government's plan to recapitalise Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland includes a Credit Package under which the banks are committed to, amongst other things, providing an additional 30% capacity for lending to first time buyers in 2009. The banks have committed to actively promote mortgage lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.A statutory code of conduct on mortgage arrears which will apply to all banks is expected to be published shortly.To provide further support, the Government also increased the rate of mortgage interest relief for first time buyers in Budget 2009 from 20% to 25% in year 1 and 2 of their mortgage and to 22.5% in years 3 to 5.  It will remain at 20% in years 6 and 7. This measure follows on from the significant improvements made in Budget 2007 & 2008. The ceiling for mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers was doubled in Budget 2007 from €4,000 single/€8,000 married to €8,000 single/€16,000 married.  The ceiling for first-time buyers was further increased in Budget 2008 to €10,000 single/€20,000 married.  Moreover, the majority of lending institutions have also now passed on in full the cumulative interest rate decreases of 2.25% announced by the European Central Bank since October 2008.

It is intended that these strategies will be rolled forward on an annual basis to ensure that local authorities continue to pursue a planned and strategic approach towards meeting the land requirements for their social and affordable housing programmes.  In addition, where appropriate, it is open to individual local authorities to acquire land by compulsory purchase for their housing programmes. Considerable investment has been made in servicing of land, and the 9th housing land availability survey, undertaken in June 2007, indicated that there was 15,100 hectares of zoned serviced land nationally, with an estimated yield of 469,937 housing units.In the context of the forthcoming Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, the Government also proposes to introduce, as a possible alternative to compulsory acquisition, the possibility for planning authorities to impose an annual development incentive levy on designated land.

Energy efficiency measures to tackle deficiencies in households also support and strengthen employment in the construction and energy services sectors.I launched the national Home Energy Savings Scheme on Sunday last with a budget of €50 million in 2009.  This is expected to support the upgrade of at least 27,500 homes, and with other building insulation programmes in my own Department and the Department of the Environment, will contribute to the creation of 4,000 direct and indirect jobs.Experience from the pilot phase of the Home Energy Saving Scheme in 2008 has demonstrated that there is considerable demand for a support scheme for energy efficiency measures, not only among householders, but also among building energy rating assessors, product manufacturers, installers and other market players.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) estimates that demand among householders across the country could well exceed 100,000 homes over the lifetime of the scheme.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 on their energy bills if they implement the full suite of measures being proposed under the national scheme.This Scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, varying depending on the measure concerned.  Owners of homes built prior to 2006 can now contact SEI on 1850 927000 or hes@sei.ie to register their interest in this scheme.

In that regard my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These initiatives have helped to facilitate the development of the market to the point where over 60% of Irish households now have a broadband connection.  ComReg's quarterly report for Q3 2008 states that 61.1% of those households have a connection in the speed category of 2mbps-10mbps.  At the end of Q1 2008, 83% of Irish SMEs had a broadband connection.  Over 70% of those SMEs, according to ComReg's report for Q3 2008, had a connection in the speed category of 2mbps-10mbps.There are still some parts of the country where the private sector cannot justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, my Department has undertaken to implement the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and has entered into a contract with 3, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  3 will be required to provide services to all residences and businesses that are within the NBS area and who seek a service.  Services will begin to be rolled out in April 2009 and the entire NBS area will be served by September 2010.Details of the areas to be covered by 3 under the NBS are available at www.three.ie/nbs.  Moreover, the consultation paper on Next Generation Broadband, which was launched for public consultation earlier this year, considered the optimum role for Government in facilitating the roll out of high speed broadband networks and sets out the Government’s commitments in that regard.  A central commitment is that there will be universal access to broadband by 2010 and that by 2012 our broadband speeds will equal or exceed those in comparator EU regions.  The consultation period on the paper has now concluded and my officials have examined the written submissions received and the contributions made at a one day consultation forum that I hosted on 30th September 2008.  I intend to publish a finalised report shortly having regard to the contributions we have received.

This is because it is a joint North-South project approved for 75% EU funding under the INTERREG IV Cross Border Cooperation Programme.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, our joint partners in the Kelvin project, has approved a total of €18m for the Kelvin project for total public funding of €30m.  Expenditure of €1,290,781 was paid by my Department towards the Kelvin project in December 2008 after the award of the contract.In July the Kelvin project was at the tendering stage, whereas the contract has now been awarded to implement the project.  The evaluation of the tenders submitted for the implementation of the project was a joint process between officials of my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland.The Kelvin project will provide high speed direct international broadband connectivity to the North West of Ireland at a very competitive cost, in particular for the towns of Derry, Letterkenny, and Monaghan.  This will make the region more attractive for international business and for foreign direct investment and will improve Ireland's overall international connectivity.  We are fortunate that funding was made available for the Kelvin project in view of current pressures on public funding; this reflects the strategic benefits of the project for the North West of Ireland and for Ireland as a whole.

This market has already attracted new entrants to the Irish electricity generation market.Our ambitious renewable generation targets will also attract new generators to the Irish market.  However, the all island market is relatively small and accordingly only a certain level of generation capacity can be adequately accommodated.This is mirrored by developments in the retail electricity market.  Airtricity has decided to offer a new tariff to domestic electricity users to compete with ESB and I understand that other companies are currently considering entering sections of the market.  This progress represents the dawning of real choice for electricity consumers, which will help to keep energy costs competitive.The Government will continue to promote the development of competition as a cornerstone of our energy policy.  We will ensure the completion of the reduction of ESB's market share in line with the CER-ESB Asset Strategy Agreement, the completion of the transfer of the Transmission System Assets from ESB to EirGrid, the successful development of the East West Interconnector by 2012 and the implementation of the grid development strategy set out in EirGrid's Grid 25 programme.On a European level, the Government will continue to implement reform of the electricity and gas markets in line with EU Internal Energy Market Directives.

The regulation of the transportation of LPG by sea is a matter for the Maritime Safety Directorate under maritime safety legislation.  Transportation overland and the safety regulation of storage facilities are covered by regulations governing the transportation and storage of dangerous substances, and by the Health, Safety and Welfare Act 2005.Section 14 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 enables the CER's responsibilities to be extended to cover the activities of LPG undertakings and installers with respect to safety.  My Department is liaising with the CER in regard to the commencement of this provision.  I understand that the CER expects to publish final proposals on the safety regulation of the LPG industry in the near future.  These proposals will inform a decision on the commencement of Section 14.  I have no plans to extend the role of the CER beyond the regulatory role as envisaged under Section 14.While the regulation of Bord Gáis Éireann natural gas tariffs is the responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is statutorily independent in the performance of its functions, the Commission has no function in regard to the setting of the retail price of LPG, which is a by-product of oil.  The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is no price control on petroleum products in Ireland.  The National Consumer Agency has specific responsibilities for protecting the rights of consumers.

The Meath-Cavan and North-South transmission lines are part of a major upgrade to supplies in the North East region and will bring critical infrastructure to the North East region, ensuring the delivery of high quality and highly reliable services into the future and facilitating competition as part of the All Island electricity market.EirGrid will be required in its planning application to An Bord Pleanála to submit full details of its proposed route and technology selection.  Consultations on the route selection are ongoing.  As part of these consultations EirGrid has opened information centres in Navan and Monaghan and has met with stakeholders including individuals, local interest groups and public interest groups.  At a recent meeting that I facilitated with North East Pylon Pressure (NEPP), it was agreed that consultations between EirGrid and NEPP would be intensified with a view to progressing a shared understanding in relation to the projects.  I understand that EirGrid has also agreed to facilitate a meeting between NEPP's consultants (Askon) and EirGrid's own technical experts, and will fund the costs of Askon attending the meeting.  EirGrid will shortly publish a detailed study on undergrounding issues relating to the entire route, the preparation of which is one of a number of requirements for its application for planning consent to An Bord Pleanála.  EirGrid expects to submit a planning application for the North/South interconnector to the planning authority, the Strategic Infrastructure Board of An Bord Pleanála, in 2009 which will include a full Environmental Impact Statement.  The target completion date is 2012.The East-West Interconnector is a 500 MW High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) interconnector, which will link the electricity grids of Ireland and Great Britain.  The advantages that the development of the East West interconnector will bring include improved security of supply and increased competition in the single electricity market as well as significant environmental benefits such as assisting in achieving our ambitious renewable targets and reducing carbon credit payments.EirGrid has been entrusted with the development and ownership of this interconnector by the Government.  Working closely with the CER and with my Department, EirGrid is progressing the project to schedule.  The Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (EirGrid) Act 2008 provides the necessary legal basis for EirGrid to construct, own and operate an interconnector.  I am advised that EirGrid expects the contract for design and construction of the interconnector to be completed shortly, when the successful bidder will be announced.  EirGrid has secured Woodland in County Meath as the connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission system and Deeside in Wales on the UK side.  Furthermore, EirGrid has undertaken a marine survey to determine the most suitable route for the undersea cable.  A planning application in respect of the project was submitted to An Bord Pleanála in November 2008 and public consultation is currently underway in respect of foreshore aspects of the development.  The target for the completion of commissioning and testing and the start of commercial operations is 2012.  The project remains on track to meet these target completion dates, subject to the outcome of the planning processes.Financing options for this project are being pursued by EirGrid with the objective of achieving the most cost-effective and efficient financial package.  The European Commission has included the Interconnector on the list of energy projects under the European Economic Recovery Package which is currently being negotiated in Brussels.  I welcome the Commission's recognition of the strategic importance of the project and will continue to work intensively in the negotiations with Member States and the European Parliament to secure the funding.

The number of companies and employees based in the Hub has grown steadily and the demand for additional space for digital media companies continues to increase.  There are now 870 employees working in 101 companies located in the Digital Hub.  A further 290 approximately contract employees are engaged on a regular basis by Hub companies.  Approximately one in six digital media companies currently operating in Ireland is based in the Digital Hub.  The work of these companies encompasses computer gaming, animation, on-line bookings, Internet security, website development, mobile technologies, broadcasting, design and Internet services.  Such highly-skilled knowledge economy companies are key to maintaining and developing economic success.The DHDA has been successful in developing and promoting the identity and brand of the Hub.  Late last year, GOA Games Services, a subsidiary of France Telecom, which already employs 200 people in the Digital Hub, announced an expansion to 400 employees in the next 12 months.  Gala Games, a Japanese employer also located in the Hub, recently announced 50 new jobs.  Havok, an Irish world leader in computer graphics technologies, was recognised with an Emmy Award in the United States last year.  It is also notable that two Digital Hub companies, Lincor and Zamano, took first and second place in the Deloitte Fast 50 rankings of Ireland's fastest growing enterprises.The DHDA also has remits relating to education, community and urban regeneration.  The DHDA delivers a very successful learning programme, which provides state-of-the-art digital media education to schools and the wider community in Dublin's south-west inner city, with a view to improving learning, employment and leisure opportunities for local residents.  The programme is very successful with over 3,300 participants in 2008.  To date, in excess of 10,000 individuals have participated in these programmes.The growing demand for commercial property for digital media companies at the Digital Hub is further evidence of success.  The DHDA has leased office space to meet the requirements of its tenant companies and has reached the point where all of its own available space has been occupied — approximately 80,000 square feet in State ownership by the DHDA or the OPW.  A further 80,000 square feet is occupied by Digital Hub tenants under interim lease arrangements with third parties.  An additional 20,000 square feet is likely to be delivered during 2009 under a proposal to redevelop another State owned building.  In order to rationalise its property portfolio and continue to cater for expansion, the DHDA has entered into an agreement with two private developers for an additional 140,000 square feet of office space.  Planning permission was granted for this last year.

I welcome the fact that the CER announced on 1 December 2008 that there would be no further increase in the price of gas from January 2009 and that there would be a small average decrease from that month of just less than 1% in the price of electricity supplied by ESB Customer Supply.  This decision is reflective of recent easing in international fossil fuel prices, which follows a period of exponential increases in global oil, gas and coal prices.  I also welcome the substantial rebate being provided by ESB to all electricity customers, irrespective of supplier, which has helped to stabilise electricity prices for 2009.The CER is required to examine the costs underlying the regulated tariffs to ensure they are cost reflective.  However, I believe that we can lower energy costs to consumers in a non-distortionary fashion, through an expedited review of tariffs.  To achieve this, I have asked the energy regulator to undertake an immediate review of options to bring forward a reduction in electricity prices. As I stated in this House last week if current trends in energy prices, particularly gas continue, I would expect a double-digit cut in electricity and gas prices to become a reality later this year.Encouraging a competitive energy supply is a key policy objective for the Government.  Rising energy costs are a major concern for all sectors of the economy and for consumers.  It is a major concern for the European Union and globally.  In this context, I welcome the National Competitiveness Council's investigation into electricity prices.  This report, along with other recently published research, such as Sustainable Energy Ireland's report on Understanding Electricity and Gas Prices in Ireland, provide a valuable insight into the drivers of higher energy costs in our market.  In particular, they underline the imperative to reduce Ireland's dependence on imported fossil fuels and our exposure to volatile international market prices for these commodities.The Government's Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government set out the actions being taken to deliver security, sustainability and competitiveness of energy supply.  We must use energy far more efficiently, deliver on our ambitious renewable targets and progress vital strategic energy infrastructure such as the East West Electricity Interconnector.  Initiatives in all these areas are being progressed.

Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.   The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health ministers during 2009.Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department has taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.Regarding the labelling of poultry meat, there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them.  In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling. However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.There is also the issue where a primary product can enter Ireland and be processed in some way thereby allowing it to be branded, as an Irish product, this is known as "substantial transformation" This terminology originates in WTO, CODEX and EU Legislation governing the EU Custom Code and therefore can only be amended at EU level.  I have been concerned that this arrangement could, in certain circumstances, be used to mislead the consumers as to the origin of the raw materials used in certain products. This was one of the principal points made to the European Commission in the context of our request for their approval of our proposed national arrangements.We will continue to pursue this issue in conjunction with Department of Health and Children, at EU level in the context of the current review. In the meantime products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on   product origin.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The product recall scheme provides assistance in respect of eligible product manufactured from pigs slaughtered in Ireland between 1 September and 6 December 2008. However, a case has been made for other products manufactured in Ireland and that were affected by the product recall to be considered for assistance. These would include products containing both Irish and imported pigmeat and products made here using solely imported pigmeat that, at the time of the recall, could not be segregated satisfactorily to facilitate their sale. My Department is currently considering the position of such products.As regards identification of country of production, in December 2007  my Department  submitted to the European Commission draft national legislation that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultrymeat and sheepmeat and on food products containing over 70% of these meats. Over the last year the Department has been in extensive communication with the Commission with a view to justifying and pressing the case for the proposed legislation. The Commission, however, adopted a negative opinion in relation to our proposal on the grounds that it was not consistent with the EU labelling directive. The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances. This negative opinion was formally adopted at a meeting of the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in December 2008.My Department will continue to press for compulsory country of origin labelling in the context of the Commission's proposal for a new regulation on food information. The Department of Health and Children is the lead Department for that proposal and my Department will continue to liaise with it on this issue.

The first is a scheme of performance-related awards that applies to Deputy and Assistant Secretaries and equivalent grades.  It does not apply to the Secretary General.  Details of awards to individual officers under the performance related scheme are not disclosed on the basis that they are confidential to the officer concerned.  In 2008 a total of €180,000 was paid to 11 staff in respect of their performance during 2007.  Details of the operation of this scheme are available in the annual reports of the Committee for Performance Awards which can be accessed on the website of the Department of Finance www.finance.gov.ie.Following the announcement in the Dáil on 5 February last relating to the discontinuation of the scheme for Assistant Secretaries, Deputy Secretary and related grades, there is now no specific provision for payment under this scheme.The Minister for Finance, in 1998, sanctioned payment of not more than 0.2% of Subhead A.1 (Salaries), to individual staff members or groups of staff in recognition of exceptional performance of duty.  Awards under this provision can be made in the case of all grades below Assistant Secretary level.  In 2008 €405,595 was paid out to staff in recognition of exceptional performance carried out in 2007.  No funds have been allocated for the payment of awards in 2009.

This application was selected for a satellite eligibility inspection, which required a follow-up field visit being carried out by a Department inspector.  During this visit, discrepancies were found in relation to parcels A11812095, A11812096, A11812097 and A11812102.  As a result of these discrepancies the claimed area of 47.04ha was reduced to 45.03.  If the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held, penalties will be applied as per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme.  In this case the number of entitlements held by the person named is 47.04.  As the difference between the area declared and the area found is more than 3%, under EU Regulations, the difference between the area found and the area claimed is doubled and deducted from the area found.  As a result the area put forward for payment under the Single Payment Scheme was 41.01 hectares.  Notification of these results will be forwarded to the person named in writing as a matter of priority.  If the person named is not satisfied with the results of the inspection, he may seek a review by contacting his Local Office.  He also has the right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Agriculture Appeals Office.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	858	The Department of Social and Family Affairs offers a range of education and employment supports designed to assist and facilitate people on social welfare payments to return to the active labour force.The back to education allowance (BTEA) is the main education support scheme of the Department. It is designed to encourage people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to work. An applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period, to qualify for the back to education allowance. This requirement has always been a feature of the BTEA scheme and is considered necessary to ensure that limited resources are directed at those most in need. The allowance essentially replaces a person's existing social welfare income and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 6 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course. In addition, the qualifying period for access to the third level option is further reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.FÁS Employment Service helps job-seekers, in particular those who are most marginalised, to enter-re-enter the active labour market. Job-seekers who are considered to be distant from the labour market are provided with appropriate and intensive professional vocational guidance which results in an action plan setting out specific actions and measures to be implemented with a view to helping them integrate into the labour force.FÁS provides various financial supports in the form of allowances to assist participants of training.  FÁS provides various financial supports in the form of allowances to assist participants of training courses and grants or subventions to encourage employers to support training programmes. Participants on the majority of FÁS training courses are eligible for various allowances.

Under section 15(2)(d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.Article 42 of the Constitution provides for the right of parents to choose the form of education they provide or to have provided to their children.  Primary legislation gives effect to this right and includes the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.None of the foregoing legislation specifically distinguishes between parents who act in concert and those who disagree and are separated, divorced or unmarried. However each provides that "parent" shall be interpreted to include — "a foster parent, a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Children Acts, 1964 to 1997, or other person acting in loco parentis who has a child in his or her care subject to any statutory power or order of a court and, in the case of a child who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, or, where the child has been adopted outside the State, means the adopter or adopters or the surviving adopter".My Department has not issued guidelines to schools in relation to school enrolment policies. Enrolment of children is, in the first instance, a matter for Boards of Management rather than my Department and Boards must address the circumstances of each case while respecting any order made by the Court in relation to the custody and welfare of the child.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level in relation to both staffing and grant levels were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.The staffing schedule for the 2009/2010 school year, Primary Circular 0002/2009, has been published on my Department's website at www.education.ie and my officials have written to all schools to notify them in this regard. The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.Within the terms of the staffing arrangements for primary schools there is provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30th September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30th September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.It is open to the school referred to by the Deputy to submit an application for an additional post(s) to the Primary Payments Section of my Department if it considers that it meets the criteria for developing status.The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.

When the long-term projected enrolment has been finalised and agreed with the school authorities, my Department will draw up schedules of accommodation for the project which will be notified to the school management authority. The project will then be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.Pending the completion of this assessment, it is open to the school authorities to contact my Department with regard to any immediate shortage of accommodation to cater for its needs. To date, no requests have been made to my Department from the school authorities for additional accommodation to cater for 1st year students looking for places for the 2009/10 school year.

Applications for such accommodations are submitted by schools on behalf of their students.A range of accommodations are provided to enable students with special needs to access the Certificate examinations. For example enlarged print, Braille translation, modified questions, use of a scribe, a reader, a personal assistant, a tape recorder or word processor, may be allowed depending on needs. The scheme was introduced following the report of an expert advisory group, and the introduction enabled opportunities to be provided for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment.I have forwarded your query to the State Examinations Commission who will give you a more comprehensive reply.

Currently a grant system operates, which allows the Boards to claim from my Department, the funding required to pay these teachers.  The Boards of Management pay the part-time teachers directly.Under the terms of the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act, 2001, qualified eligible part-time teachers are entitled to be paid salary appropriate to their qualifications and to receive incremental credit in respect of relevant teaching service.In order to ensure that the terms of this Act could be applied to any part-time teachers paid directly by school boards, my Department took the view that the best approach was to extend the single payroll process which is in place for all other teachers in primary, secondary and community and comprehensive schools rather than persist with the practice of having boards pay them directly.  This approach would ensure that the teachers concerned could get full credit for their overall service where they served part-time in more than one school.  The new payroll is being developed and will be introduced from 1 September 2009 and arrears will be paid by November 2009.It is not possible to assess the exact cost of the arrears until the new payroll is introduced.

Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability. A pupil's level of care may diminish over time as the child matures. Pupils may move to a different school or on to post-primary school. In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the SNA support required in the school. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The NCSE has confirmed that the level of SNA support allocated to the school in question is sufficient to meet the care needs of the children with special educational needs. The NCSE has advised my Department that the local SENO has met with the parents concerned and has clarified the position regarding their child's special educational needs. It is open to the parents to contact the SENO directly to discuss any matter relating to their child's special educational needs.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	879	On foot of Circular 0138/2006, primary schools are implementation standardised testing in English Reading and Mathematics at two stages, at the end of first class/beginning of second class, and at the end of fourth class/beginning of fifth class since 2007. The results of these tests are held at school level and are available for inspection. Standardised testing is used as one of a range of modes of assessment that help teachers to make more informed decisions in relation to teaching and learning. The results of standardised tests can be used to inform parents of pupils' progress and to assist in the identification of pupils that may require support. They are also available to the Inspectorate as part of the school evaluation process.It was not intended that the results of standardised testing would be reported to the Department or used in any way which would facilitate school comparisons or the compilation of league tables. Instead, the implementation of standardised testing at school level is being complemented by a separate programme of national monitoring in English reading and Mathematics undertaken by the Educational Research Centre (ERC). Schools in the DEIS programme have already been sampled by the Educational Research Centre for this purpose, and the sample of non-DEIS English medium schools is planned for 2009, with the sample of Irish medium schools planed for 2010. This programme will establish trends over time for particular categories of school. No individual school results will be identifiable in this process.The introduction of standardised testing was supported by a national programme of teacher professional development in assessment for learning. Grants of €1.65m, €1.7m and €1.76m have issued to schools in December 2006, December 2007 and December 2008 for the cost of test materials, teachers' manuals, test scoring services or test-related software. Guidelines on assessment developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment were published in October 2007 and issued to all teachers to assist schools in developing and implementing a policy on assessment practice in classrooms and on reporting to parents.

Nationality; orhave Official Refugee Status; orhave been granted Humanitarian Leave to Remain in the State (prior to the Immigration Act 1999); orbe a person in respect of whom the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has granted permission to remain following a determination not to make a  deportation order under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish  national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; orhave permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU Member State who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a person, not having EU nationality; orbe nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland. Candidates must meet the nationality requirements of the scheme.The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required. If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

It is expected that approximately one thousand additional part-time resource teachers will be paid on the new payroll when it is introduced. It is not possible to determine the exact cost of the arrears payable to this group of part-time teachers until the new payroll is introduced. Factors such as the qualifications of the individual, the level of teaching service undertaken and the incremental point of the individual on the common basic scale all affect the amount of the arrears payable.

This provision is in line with the 2008 outturn when the expected additional income to the NCI from the increase in the third level student services charge is taken into account. This allocation must also be viewed in the context of overall increases to NCI in recent years where the current allocation represents a doubling of the provision allocated to the College in 2001 (€3.36m) and an increase of some 27% over the funding provided in 2004 (€5.669m).The Government has taken decisions to control public expenditure in light of the current economic climate and as the Deputy will appreciate it will be necessary for NCI to achieve appropriate savings in line with the requirement for all other third level institutions to do likewise.The Deputy may be aware that the cap on student numbers relates to funding under my Departments Free Fees Initiative for up to 925 students in the NCI.  The College cannot expand on this limit without the approval of my Department and the Department of Finance. The NCI are free to increase the number of student places that they offer outside the free fees scheme.Specific requests have been received from NCI to lift this cap on numbers of free fee places so as to increase places in IT and business and financial related courses. My Department has examined the College's request for an increase in places on IT related courses, however the view is that there is no need for additional IT related courses at this time due to general demand being less than places available.The Deputy may be aware that the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs published a report on the Future Skills and Research Needs of the International Financial Services Industry. The responsibility for managing the implementation of a number of recommendations in this report has been assigned to Skillnets, which is the enterprise-led support body whose mission is to enhance the skills of people in employment in Irish industry.In relation to the issue of using NCI to tackle unemployment and low skilled workers, proposals to activate greater numbers of unemployed people, through education, training, employment and community programmes are currently being examined, having regard to existing resources, by Government.

The first is that substitute cover is provided for the first day of an absence of a teacher on uncertified sick leave in schools with two or less classroom teachers.The second is that in the event that two or more teachers in a school are absent from teaching duty on the first day of uncertified sick leave, substitute cover is provided for the second and subsequent teachers that are absent.The existing arrangements for substitute cover for other absences of teachers from teaching duty continue to apply.In the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the additional expenditure and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are met.

My Department provides the majority of the funding required by VECs for the delivery of these programmes.As of January 2009 approximately 9,069 whole time equivalent (wte) teaching posts and 709 SNA (wte) posts are allocated to VEC post primary schools. A breakdown of the allocation of teaching and SNA posts to post primary schools in each VEC is attached for the Deputy's information.The information sought by the Deputy in relation to non-teaching and ancillary staff is not readily available. I have asked my officials to compile this information and to forward it to the Deputy as soon as it is available.

Education is one of only three Government Departments to have increased funding in 2009.The provision for funding to Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) for 2009 shows an increase of more than 5% over the 2008 level. Funding to VECs for 2008 totalled €887.5m and this will rise to €936m in 2009.VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the management and appropriation of their budgets. This allows each VEC to distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need.The provision that I have made, in the context of the 2009 estimates, for this significant increase in the funding of VECs is a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources in order to best address the needs of learners availing of services provided through the network of VECs.The Deputy will appreciate that the figure for 2009 is based on the Budget announcement made in October 2008. Accordingly, in the light of the Government's recent announcement regarding further necessary economic and spending measures, the VEC budget figure for 2009 may yet be subject to some adjustment.

VECs are given a high level of autonomy in the  management and appropriation of their budgets and each VEC is allowed to  distribute its allocations in line with its priorities and perceptions of need.  Accordingly, my Department does not have available to it a detailed breakdown  of the distribution of funds by VECs across their schools and head offices. However, I can inform the Deputy that in 2008 VECs spent approximately €629m on what is termed instruction pay (teachers and special needs assistants) in post  primary schools and approximately €58.5 million on what is termed administration pay in post primary schools and head offices.

The role of my Department is to provide guidance and  support to schools in implementing child protection policy and to refer any  allegations received to the appropriate authorities for investigation.I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has issued child protection  guidelines and procedures to all schools.  The guidelines are based on Children  First — the Department of Health & Children's national guidelines for the  protection and welfare of children. The Children First guidelines make very  clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of  suspected child abuse wherever they occur, and the lead role of the HSE. The  guidelines for schools require each board of management to designate a senior  member of staff, normally the principal, as the Designated Liaison Person (DLP)  for the school. The DLP acts as a liaison person with the health authorities  and other agencies on child protection issues and as a resource person to any  staff member who has concerns in this regard. My Department does not keep a  register of Designated Liaison Persons. The appointment of DLP's is a matter  for each school.In 2006, my Department issued Circulars to all schools reminding them, amongst other things, of the requirement to have a DLP appointed.  As part of the circular, schools were issued with and were required to complete a  questionnaire which sought to ascertain the level of compliance with the  guidelines. The indications from that survey were that the vast majority of  schools had DLP's in place at that time. My Department does not have current  information in relation to all schools. As part of Whole School Evaluation the  Department's Inspectorate checks that Child Protection Policies are in place  and that a Designated Liaison Person has been appointed.The Department has provided and continues to provide in-service training for  Designated Liaison Persons and Deputy Designated Liaison Persons to assist them in dealing with child protection issues.  In addition, the Department  facilitates training for boards of management, parent education and also  provides training at Pre-Service level if requested to do so by the colleges of  education.

In that context it should be noted  that, in addition to whole-school evaluations and subject inspections,  Inspectors are involved in a wide range of other work such as programme  evaluations, the preparation of composite and thematic evaluation reports on  aspects of educational provision in schools, inspection of primary teachers on  probation and participation in appeal boards established under Section 29 of  the Education Act. Inspectors also provide advice on an on-going basis to  various sections within the Department on policy issues including teacher  education, special education, and qualifications, curriculum and assessment  policy.While it is not possible to provide the Deputy with specific travel and  subsistence costs in respect of whole-school evaluations and subject  inspections, I can provide details of the total travel and subsistence expenses  associated with the complete work programme of the Inspectorate division, for  each year since 2004, as set out belowYear€20041,429,559.3320051,378,130.3820061,576,419.3120071,693,653.2720081,558,952.27The total budget allocation for my Department in 2008 was €9.3 billion.

However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	895	The selection and enrolment of pupils in schools is the responsibility of the authorities of the individual school. Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.Article 42 of the Constitution provides for the right of parents to choose the  form of education they provide or to have provided to their children.  Primary legislation gives effect to this right and includes the Education Act  1998 and the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.None of the foregoing legislation specifically distinguishes between parents  who act in concert and those who disagree and are separated, divorced or  unmarried. However each provides that "parent" shall be interpreted to include- "a foster parent, a guardian appointed under the Guardianship of Children Acts,  1964 to 1997, or other person acting in loco parentis who has a child in his or  her care subject to any statutory power or order of a court and, in the case of  a child who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1998, or, where  the child has been adopted outside the State, means the adopter or adopters or  the surviving adopter".My Department has not issued guidelines to schools in relation to school  enrolment policies. Enrolment of children is, in the first instance, a matter  for Boards of Management rather than my Department and Boards must address the circumstances of each case while respecting any order made by the Court in  relation to the custody and welfare of the child.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	896	Work on implementing the recommendations outlined in the report by the Expert  Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) on the Future Requirement for High-level  ICT Skills in the ICT Sector is ongoing. The Higher Education Authority (HEA)  is funding a number of awareness initiatives to promote ICT courses to  prospective students and the HEA continues to provide funding to third level  institutions, both to improve the attractiveness of existing ICT courses and to  set up new ones. An encouraging sign is that enrolments on level 8 computing  courses increased by 10% in 2008.In regard to second level, I have recently launched a major initiative, Project  Maths, designed to encourage better understanding of maths, to reinforce the  practical relevance of maths to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity  between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle. The initiative  started in 2008 and is being piloted in 24 schools. The curriculum changes will  be phased in over three years and mainstreaming will begin in 2010, prefaced by  a national programme of professional development for teachers beginning in  2009. Project Maths will be supported by intensive investment in professional  development for teachers and by investment in materials and exemplars for  teachers. Some €3m has been provided for the programme in 2009 and the  investment will continue over a number of years, to at least 2013, in a rolling  programme of reform.I am aware of the calls for the introduction of bonus points for Higher Level  Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate. Decisions on the award of points and  admission criteria for entry to higher education programmes are, under  legislation, a matter for the higher education institutions. Following the  release of the EGFSN Report, my Department asked the Higher Education Authority to initiate a discussion across higher education institutions regarding the desirability or otherwise of awarding bonus points. The overall view emerging  was that the introduction of bonus points was unlikely to dramatically increase  uptake of Higher Level Maths and unlikely to contribute to the national  objective of greater participation in science, technology and engineering  courses. The Report of the Points Commission in 1999 considered the issue of  bonus points and recommended against such an approach on the grounds that it  would lead to a narrowing of the range of subjects taken by students, create  pressure on students to make early career choices, give rise to equity issues  where the subject was not available and lead to distortions in the third level  access and provision. Providing bonus points could reinforce the perception  that Maths is a difficult subject. It should be noted that when bonus points  were removed in 1994 on foot of curricular reform, participation in Higher  Level Maths increased. We can therefore conclude that curriculum reform has  more impact than points in this area. Introducing bonus points would inevitably  lead to similar demands in other subjects such as science. The education sector  must cater for all students, and placing some subjects at a higher value,  notwithstanding the importance of other sectors of the economy, and the  abilities and interests and legitimate choices of students, could potentially  be counterproductive to the overall interests of the system.

In the event of the receipt of a request for  additional grant aid for the project from the school authority, this will be  assessed.  However, it should be noted that a central tenet of the grant scheme  is that the school, granted discretion and funding, must equally accept  responsibility for prioritisation, adherence to statutory regulations, control  of costs and ensuring value for money.  The scheme is not intended to leave  schools with significant fundraising needs but for the school to tailor the  scope of capital works commissioned to the funding available.  The decision on  whether to continue participating in scheme or to drop out, if the scope of  building is more than the funding envelope permits, is a matter for each school  authority.

This procedure has been formalised within the past year.I can confirm that complaints were raised by two parents in relation to the psychologist referred to by the Deputy but within the limits of the detail supplied NEPS was satisfied that there were no grounds for further action in either instance. The individual fulfils all the above requirements for involvement in the panel and remains on the current panel.  In addition I have recently referred another matter for consideration to the State Examinations Commissions in regard to this psychologist although not in direct connection with the SCPA. My Department has had no involvement in any complaints by other professionals in regard to this panellist.Should the Deputy have any pertinent information to bring to the matter I would ask that he submit it to my Department for examination. Of course, officials from my Department's NEPS service are available to meet with and discuss the concerns of any parent or school authority in relation to the scheme.I set out below for the Deputy's information a copy of the SCPA Guidelines for Psychologists — 2009 which, along with other relevant information on the Scheme is available on my Department's website.While as Minister I am of course concerned in relation to all aspects of quality of service throughout the education system, I should add that neither my Department nor NEPS is a disciplinary body for psychologists.   Such matters fall within the province of the particular psychologist's professional body and formal complaints in regard to professional conduct should properly be referred by the complainant to that body (e.g. Psychological Society of Ireland).
SCHEME FOR THE COMMISSIONING OF PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS   (SCPA)

Guidelines for SCPA Psychologists — 2009

Purpose of the Scheme
The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding for schools to commission individual psychological assessments for children from psychologists working in a private capacity, pending the expansion of the service provided by the Department of Education and Science (DES)/National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to all schools.  NEPS is a section of the DES.The scheme is not a substitute for a full educational psychological service of the sort provided by NEPS.  It is an interim measure intended to meet current urgent needs for psychological assessment of children and young people.  The DES will review the operation of the scheme on an ongoing basis.
Terms and Conditions of the Scheme
Schools are responsible for commissioning psychologists to carry out assessments under the scheme.  Schools may only commission psychologists who are on the SCPA panel.The number of assessments that a school can commission under the scheme is determined by the number of pupils enrolled in that school.The number of assessments that may be conducted by a psychologist under the scheme cannot exceed 180 in any school year.An individual psychological assessment, in its entirety, must be wholly and exclusively carried out by a psychologist whose name appears on the SCPA panel.Payment for assessments carried out under the scheme must be made from SCPA funds and from such funds alone.  Psychologists who accept commissions under the scheme may not seek or accept payment from any other source in respect of such commissions and will be required to certify that they have not done so as a condition of receiving payment.  Seeking or accepting payment from any other source in respect of an assessment under the scheme will constitute grounds for removal from the SCPA panel.Schools and psychologists are required to adhere to the recommended procedures, as laid down by the DES/NEPS.SCPA psychologists must work within their areas of competence, keep abreast of relevant  developments and comply with DES policy at all times.
Selection of Psychologists for Participation in the Scheme
The SCPA panel of psychologists is compiled by NEPS.  This list is regularly updated and is available in the NEPS section of the DES website  — www.education.ie.  A web link is provided below:
2009 Panel of Psychologists
Psychologists on the SCPA panel are private practitioners who have satisfied NEPS:that they are graduate members of an appropriate professional body (e.g. the Psychological Society of Ireland (PSI) or the British Psychological Society (BPS)) and that they have at least two years supervised experience of administering and interpreting psychological tests for childrenthat they are registered or chartered or certified by an appropriate professional body and receiving on-going supervision
or
that they are receiving on-going supervision that could confer registered status within three years with PSIthat they adhere to the PSI Code of Ethics and to the ‘Policy on the use of Psychometric Tests in Ireland' (adapted by PSI in November 2007)that they have obtained Garda clearancethat they have obtained a Tax Clearance Certificate from the Revenue CommissionersMembership of the panel only implies the eligibility of the psychologist to conduct assessments under the scheme and (provided the requisite terms and conditions are satisfied) to receive payment for such assessments.The 2008 panel will expire on 31st December, 2008.  Persons who are admitted to the 2009 panel are eligible to conduct assessments under the scheme from 1st January, 2009 until 30th June, 2009 subject to the terms and conditions laid down in the SCPA Guidelines for 2009.  Psychologists are obliged both to familiarise themselves with and to adhere to these terms and conditions.As the 2009 panel will expire on 30th June, 2009 psychologists on that panel wishing to be admitted to the 2009/2010 scheme will be required to complete a Renewal of Membership Form in June, 2009.  Others wishing to be placed on the 2009/2010 panel will be required to follow the standard procedure for admission to the scheme.Psychologists may be suspended or removed from the panel at any time if it is determined that their work or practice falls short of the standards required under the scheme.
Procedures to be Followed by Psychologists in Implementing the Scheme
Psychologists who carry out assessments under the scheme should:1. Work within their areas of competence at all times.2. Conduct assessments with reasonable care and diligence.3. Familiarise themselves and comply with circulars and documents relevant to special educational needs which are produced, from time to time, by the DES/NEPS and by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  (These are available on the DES website – www.education.ie and on the NCSE website – www.ncse.ie).4. Supply their own appropriate, up-to-date test materials and meet their other expenses out of the fee for the assessment.5. Have some form of identification (e.g. driving licence, passport) in their possession when conducting assessments under the scheme.6. Personally carry out every component of any assessment for which they are individually  commissioned and remunerated, including all associated tasks and activities.7. Ensure, before meeting a child, that they have a copy of the Consent Form (Form 1) and of the Referral Form (Form 2) completed by the school.8. Review previous reports and relevant school records.9. Conduct the assessment on the school premises. (In exceptional circumstances, a request may be made to the local NEPS Regional Director to carry out an assessment off the school premises).10. Administer individual tests of cognitive potential and of attainments and appropriate behavioural check-lists as necessary. Engage in classroom or playground observation as required.11. Meet with the child's parents/guardians and teachers to provide verbal feedback on the assessment outcome, explaining findings and their implications.12. Provide, within one calendar month, a psychological report with recommendations for the parents/guardians and the school, bearing in mind that the style, content and format of the report should be appropriate for the recipients and in line with NEPS requirements in this area.Guidelines on report writing will be provided.  These may be amended from time to time in the context of regular reviews of the scheme.NEPS intends to review a sample of all reports received from school principals (with Form 3) as it has a responsibility to ensure that assessments meet acceptable standards and that public funds are being appropriately discharged.13. Inform NEPS when no longer accepting commissions under the scheme so that arrangements can be made for notifying schools.
Fees for Psychological Assessments Conducted under the Scheme
There is no charge to parents/guardians or to schools for assessments carried out under the scheme.A fee, subject to withholding tax, of €330 per assessment to include all expenses (including travel and subsistence) incurred by the psychologist, will be paid by NEPS.  This will result in a net fee of €264.  The psychologist will be responsible for the payment of any additional tax due.Psychologists seeking extra payment for SCPA assessments from parents/guardians or from schools may be removed from the panel.Where it is determined that a psychologist has accepted an additional payment, from a parent/guardian or from a school, for work carried out under the scheme the DES/NEPS reserves the right to withhold the standard fee from that psychologist.
Procedure for Payment under the Scheme
The payment process will be initiated upon receipt, by NEPS, of a Certificate of Completion of Assessment Form (Form 3) in respect of the individual assessment.Form 3 must be fully completed and signed by the school principal and psychologist and the original (not a copy) submitted to NEPS, by the principal, within three calendar months of the date of assessment.  This form will certify:that the assessment has been completedthat the psychological report has been received by the parents/guardians and by the school principalthat a copy of the psychological report is being sent, with Form 3, to NEPSthat the school principal and psychologist have complied with the terms and conditions of the schemePayment may be withheld or refused until the DES/NEPS is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the scheme have been complied with.  Without prejudice to the generality of the above, payment may be withheld or refused:where the assessment has not been properly conductedwhere the assessment has been wholly or partly completed by a psychologist who is not on the panelwhere the psychologist has not furnished a report in the proper formatwhere the psychologist has sought or accepted payment from a source other than the schemeWhen satisfied that the terms and conditions of the scheme have been fully complied with NEPS will arrange for payment to be made directly to the psychologist.
Grounds for Removal from Panel
Psychologists may be removed from the panel on the following grounds:failing to conduct an assessment with reasonable care and diligenceengaging in conduct which falls short of that which would be expected from a professional psychologistseeking or accepting payment from a source other than the scheme in respect of an assessment conducted under the schemefailing to personally conduct the assessment in its entiretyproviding false or misleading information in submitting a report or on Form 3providing false or misleading information in an application to be placed on the panelbring convicted of a serious criminal offenceAn allegation of serious misconduct against a psychologist on the SCPA panel may result in suspension from the panel pending investigation of the allegation and the outcome of any such investigation.
Further Information
Queries should be submitted to NEPS in writing, either by fax 01-2833181, e-mail scpa@neps.gov.ie or by conventional mail to: SCPA, National Educational Psychological Service, 3rd Floor, Trident House, Blackrock, Co. Dublin. Every effort will be made to respond to queries as soon as possible.Complaints should be dealt with at point of service.  Where informal efforts to resolve difficulties have failed, complainants may invoke a formal Complaints Procedure, details of which are available on request.
Scheme for the Commissioning of Psychological Assessments (SCPA)

General Disclaimers
Terms and conditions of the scheme are subject to ongoing review.  They may be changed or updated at any time and without notice by the Minister for Education and Science.The SCPA panel is not a register of psychologists. Membership of the panel is not to be confused with eligibility for statutory registration of psychologists.In accepting a psychologist as a member of the panel, the DES is not entering into any contractual arrangement with the psychologist.  SCPA psychologists are not employees of the DES/NEPS.
Membership of the SCPA panel confers no particular rights on psychologists and does not provide any guarantee of being commissioned to administer psychological tests in schools.

In any given year, unless otherwise stated, membership of the SCPA panel is generally valid from date of appointment until the end of that school year only.

The DES/NEPS reserves the right to remove a psychologist from the panel at any time.

The scheme may be discontinued at any time by the Minister for Education and Science.
The DES/NEPS is not a disciplinary body for psychologists.  Such matters are more properly the remit of the particular psychologist's professional body.

Issues in relation to the supervision of pupils are therefore matters for each Board of Management.   While my Department does not issue specific guidelines on requirements for supervision of pupils, it acknowledges that the degree of supervision required of school authorities varies with the circumstances, including the age of the pupil. It is the responsibility of each individual managerial authority to arrange for appropriate supervision for its pupils.At a wider level, there will be a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme in conjunction with the school management bodies and teacher unions during this school year.

A candidate who already holds a Higher Diploma/Postgraduate Diploma is only eligible for grant aid under the student maintenance grant schemes when progressing to either a masters or a doctorate qualification. The grant awarding authorities are aware that this is the progression route at postgraduate level for grants purposes.The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland is the agency with responsibility for developing and maintaining the National Framework of Qualifications.  I understand that the postgraduate diploma in education is not currently aligned to the framework but that consultations are on-going in relation to the issue.

The determination upheld the appeal, and the accompanying directive issued to the school requested that they contact the family to arrange enrolment.On 17th December, 2008, the school advised my Department that they intended to take legal advice on the matter.  Following on from this, my Department wrote to the school on 23rd December, 2008, to advise them that determinations issued by Appeal Committees under Section 29 of the Education Act are binding by statute, subject to the right of either of the parties to seek Judicial Review of this decision and to seek a stay on the implementation of the determination, pending the outcome of Judicial Review.  Officials from my Department and from the National Educational Welfare Board have had ongoing contact with the family and school in order to seek a resolution to this matter.  In the meantime, the child concerned has been receiving home tuition support.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	908	I announced the launch of a process to develop a new national strategy for higher education last Friday.  The process will be overseen by a high level steering group, chaired by economist Dr Colin Hunt and comprising national and international expertise including academic, business, community and student interests, as well as senior government officials.  It is expected that the group will complete its work before the end of the year.The higher education system is a cornerstone of national infrastructure for generating the skills, knowledge and innovation on which Ireland's future competitive advantage relies.  The strategy will be framed in the context of the Government's drive towards sustainable economic renewal and will provide a critical examination of the current environment of Irish higher education and develop a vision and national policy objectives for the next 20 years.  This will include an analysis of the current system in terms of its student numbers, funding, funding models, organisational arrangements and the roles of the different public and private entities involved in the higher education and research domain.The strategy will also take account of research activity, which is now an integral part of our higher education system.  Growing research capability is a core component of the European Union's drive under the Lisbon Agenda to become the most competitive and dynamic, knowledge-driven economy in the world.  The Government's Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) is a crucial building block in this effort and is based on a shared vision of placing Ireland firmly on the global map in terms of the excellence of our research.This is further underpinned in the Government's Framework document for Sustainable Economic Renewal "Building Ireland's Smart Economy" which aims to develop Ireland into the innovation and commercial capital of Europe.  The Government has reiterated its commitment to implementing the SSTI despite fiscal pressures and has emphasised "the need for high levels of investment in research and innovation, both for economic competitiveness, and to yield innovations in areas such as ICT, healthcare and environmental technologies, which create employment opportunities, increase economic progress and make tangible improvements to our quality of life."The number of academic publications and the frequency with which these are cited in future publications are key measures of research activity.  Forfás and the HEA are currently undertaking a mapping study of research activity in Ireland which will take stock of activity in basic, strategic, and applied research across all disciplines in both the public and enterprise sectors.  As part of the mapping exercise, a bibliometric study will be conducted to quantify the number of publications and citations from Irish research which will provide an overview of research activity and impact.

The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006.  The school in question applied for a review at that time but regrettably the school was unsuccessful in qualifying for inclusion in DEIS.  Following the introduction of DEIS, a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.Given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in Budget 2009 in order to contain public sector spending. One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.

There are around 6,500 places available nationally under the Youthreach umbrella.  3,700 of these are funded by my Department and delivered in just over 100 centres by Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  2,800 are funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and delivered in Community Training Centres by FÁS.My Department currently funds 185 Youthreach places in the county referred to by the Deputy, delivered in seven centres.  Due to the difficult budgetary position it is not possible for my Department to provide further funding for the creation of additional places on the Youthreach programme.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-10 00:00:00	Prelude	913	The Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) commenced in October 2002.  It provides flexible part-time options across Further Education and is aimed at adults with less than upper second level education, including unemployed adults.  It aims to give adults who wish to return to education an opportunity to combine their return to learning with family, work and other responsibilities.  Programmes are offered on a part-time basis in the mornings, afternoons, evenings or at weekends.  Since September 2007, any adult with less than an upper second level education is entitled to free tuition.  Originally only people with a social welfare entitlement or medical card were entitled to free tuition.  In 2008, in the county referred to by the Deputy, there were just over 800 participants in the BTEI.The Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) is a full-time second chance education and training initiative for unemployed people delivered and managed locally by the VECs.  Its primary target groups are the longer-term unemployed, the low-skilled and disadvantaged.  Courses of up to two years duration and between levels 3 and 6 on the National Qualifications Framework are offered.  Tuition, stationery and books are provided free of charge.  A childcare grant and meal and travel allowances are also available to students and they can access the adult guidance service.  In 2008, in the county referred to by the Deputy, there were 70 VTOS places available and these places were fully subscribed.The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs is a second chance educational opportunities scheme payable to people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education.  To qualify for the BTEA an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period.  The allowance is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.The statistics on participation on the BTEA scheme are collated at the end of April in order to get an overview for the full academic year.  The figure for 2007/2008 academic year for the county referred to by the Deputy was just under 80.  The figures for the 2008/2009 academic year are not yet available but it is expected that they will show a significant increase.

Under the immigration regime, such students will only be given access to work if they are attending full time programmes on the Register. The criteria for inclusion require that the programme be full-time, at least 15 hours per week for a minimum of 25 weeks, and lead to a nationally recognised award, or its international equivalent. Language programmes which meet the duration criteria and are approved under the ACELS quality assurance and inspection scheme are also eligible for inclusion on the Register, provided they offer assessment for students at the end of the programme using recognised language proficiency test instruments.The criteria for inclusion are included in an Information Note, along with the Internationalisation Register, on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The register is updated on a monthly basis.The English language sector is currently regulated on a voluntary basis by the Advisory Council for English Language Schools (ACELS), a company limited by guarantee which operates under the aegis of my Department. It provides a voluntary quality assurance and inspection scheme for private sector English language schools. ACELS also approves teacher training qualifications for the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) private sector, and has developed English language proficiency test instruments. Schools which comply with the ACELS quality assurance and inspection scheme are approved by my Department for the purpose of providing English language programmes in the private sector. The conditions for recognition of schools are available on the body's website at www.acels.ie.It is my intention that the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) will take on overall responsibility for the regulation of the international education sector.  My Department will hold discussions with the NQAI about taking on these responsibilities in the context of the planned amalgamation of the NQAI, the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC).

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting an educational placement and provide early education intervention for pre-school children with autism. Home tuition grants are paid to the parents, who in turn make payment to the home tuition provider.An arrangement to directly pay the service provider referred to by the Deputy has been agreed until the end of the current school year.  This is the only service provider being paid directly in the context of the home tuition scheme.  Up until this current school year, grants were paid to parents in respect of tuition providers who were non-serving primary teachers.
