#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to the Irish economy, which under the current Government is shrinking faster than any other developed country, according to the Economic and Social Research Institute.  GDP will have dropped by 11.6% between 2008 and 2010, levels not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the spirit of Nero fiddling while Rome burned the perceived architect of the country's misfortune seems unable to act constructively or decisively, increasing the treat to national stability.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On No. 12a, we are not prepared to accept any arrangements for the Order of Business today unless the Minister for Finance makes an arrangement to come into the House and clarify the absolute dog’s breakfast that has been made of the withdrawal of mortgage interest relief from about 60,000 home owners.  People are facing a weekend where they are not sure what their net mortgage payments are going to be from next month onwards.  We are told that this was the most prepared budget in the history of the State and that Cabinet Ministers met no less than ten times to work out the detail of the budget, yet they have left an extraordinary trail of confusion.  Tomorrow is May Day and it will be marked in many households by the beginning of the Minister for Finance’s draconian regime where people do not know what is happening to them.  Tomorrow is also pay day for Mr. Fingleton who is collecting a €27 million bonus, of which one quarter will be tax free.

We are within hours of the implementation of this change and there is total confusion as to what exactly is happening.  We are told that 500,000 people who have continuing entitlement or likely continuing entitlement to the mortgage relief will lose it tomorrow, simply because the Minister and his advisers did not anticipate the impact of the change they announced on 7 April.  We were warned months in advance by Ministers and spokespersons for the Revenue that when the income tax code is changed in mid-year, there will be difficulties.  The Minister had ample time to anticipate those difficulties and make sure that the sort of fiasco we have today would not happen.  This is an indication of failure on the part of Government. We have seen far too often this Minister and his colleagues announce initiatives, then find they cannot implement them.  This is just one more in a long series of such failures.

This was exemplified in this morning's need by "Morning Ireland" to bring back a representative from the Revenue Commissioners in order to make a second attempt at explaining exactly what was going to happen tomorrow.  It is important that the Minister for Finance come into the House today to address the issue, to clarify it for Members of the House and the wider public and to afford Members the opportunity to question him so that we can have a complete understanding of what the Government is proposing.It is a most unfortunate development because those who will suffer most as a result of this measure are those who already have been extensively penalised by this Government's measures in the supplementary budget and in last October's budget.  We need clarity on the matter and the opportunity to debate it.  Will the Minister confirm to the House that he will accommodate our wishes today?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	18	RTE is better at explaining it than the Minister.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The question of principle is that the Government proposes to restrict the availability of mortgage interest relief to a seven year period.  That applies to anybody who has bought a house for the first time, moved up to another House or who has improved their house.  It applies in all those circumstances.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Minister is wrong.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Revenue Commissioners have made it clear that in the implementation of this measure there will be no change for a first-time buyer.  For those who have improved their houses or traded up to another house and taken out a mortgage in the last seven years, the interest relief continues to be available.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have made it clear that non-first time buyers do not need to do anything at this stage.  The Revenue Commissioners will make the necessary administrative arrangements, in liaison with the financial institutions for the relevant deductions.  It may take two months for this arrangement to be finalised by the Revenue Commissioners.  Deputies will appreciate the enormous volume of work the Revenue Commissioners need to do in the implementation of a measure of this character.  The Revenue Commissioners have made it clear that non-first time buyers do not need to do anything at this stage.

There is a small number of non-first time buyers whom the Revenue may wish to contact and it will make the necessary contact before the position is finalised.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	29	While it is traditional practice that the Dáil does not sit until the Wednesday after a bank holiday, we are in exceptional times when such practices must be re-examined.  The Dáil needs to examine very important legislation, not least in respect of our banking system and the Finance Bill.  So many issues are pressing on the Government and Oireachtas time that this practice of having an extra day on bank holidays should be removed and the Dáil should be seen to be about its business.  That would give some level of confidence to people, whereas such practices are apt to cause scandal in the eyes of many people looking in at what we are doing here.  We cannot afford that when confidence is low and needs to be bolstered.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I concur with what Deputy Bruton said.  People are reeling under the shock of what the Government has done in the supplementary budget, ordinary families who feel the ordering of Government as we have known it in Ireland has collapsed.  We would understand if we heard that the people in Government were to do an away-day on Tuesday, sit down, maybe get a black board and explain the mortgage interest relief and other provisions in the supplementary budget which they have rowed back on since making very loud and confident statements.  If they went away and studied that we would all be rather comforted for the sake of the country.  If they take Tuesday off, could they at least arrange to come in here for 10.30 a.m. next Wednesday?  They could have a study day and we could come in on Wednesday and do a full day's work.

We can establish new traditions, practices and precedents.  There is a whole raft of issues to be addressed.  One issue we have not addressed was reflected here this morning.  I welcome the fact that a Government backbencher brought forward a request under Standing Order 32 asking the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House and address the issue of a threatened swine vesicular disease pandemic.

It is very important, and now that the alert has gone to level 5, one short of a declared pandemic, there is an onus and responsibility on this House properly to address this issue.  The Minister should come into the House.  She is at a meeting of health Ministers today in Europe.  Will she come into the House and report to us next week, and allow for an opportunity——

This is on the Order of Business.  I am explaining my objection to the fact that we will not assemble here again until 2.30 p.m. next Wednesday.  I would like the opportunity to explain that.  We can come up with any number of issues but this is one that requires urgent address in this House.  Will the Minister return to the House to deal with it?  The Opposition is of one mind on this and we have evidence of it in Government benches this morning.  Will the Minister for Finance agree to bring the House back early next week and have the Minister for Health and Children accountable to this House as we face a swine vesicular disease pandemic?  This is a very important issue.

On the suggestion that we should meet at 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday morning, the commemoration by the State of the 1916 Rising takes place at Arbour Hill on Wednesday morning.  As Deputy Ó Caoláin acknowledges, the Minister for Health and Children is at an emergency meeting in Luxembourg to discuss swine vesicular disease and I am sure she will be pleased to advise the House of developments next week.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I wish to inquire about the national assets management agency, NAMA.  We are now seven months on from the introduction of a guarantee and the same boards are in all the banks and the Central Bank.  We have the same boards in the Financial Regulator and effectively in the Department of Finance and in the Government.  They have hatched this proposal where the taxpayer's neck is being put on the line to deal with the banking crisis.  There is an enormous number of questions to be asked and addressed by this House.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The question must relate to the legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20500	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The Minister has indicated that he will establish this agency on an interim basis without reference to the House.  That is unacceptable and I would ask him whether he will prepare heads of legislation in the coming weeks, as we were told.  We were told last week that the entire legislation would be in place before the summer.  However, if he is going to produce the heads, will he, in accordance with accepted precedent, present them to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service so that there can be a proper input by the Oireachtas into the shape of the Bill before either the interim board or the system is bedded down?  Out of respect to taxpayers and their representatives he should provide for that.With regard to the forthcoming Finance Bill, the Taoiseach yesterday said the Government had taken €8 billion out of the deficit.  He omitted to say that €6 billion of that had come from extra taxes that ordinary families will have to pay.  Tomorrow we will have the extraordinary situation whereby a person on €36,000, an average industrial wage, will be paying tax at the rate of 51%.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	51	On the issue of the proposed NAMA, I have asked the Minister before whether he can facilitate a detailed debate in this House about what is being proposed.  We are now told that there is to be a shadow NAMA authority and board appointed.  There will be no opportunity for scrutiny of this board.  The Minister also promised legislation in regard to a Labour Party proposal of a commission to supervise and have oversight of the whole banking and regulatory system in this time of terrible national economic crisis.  It is extraordinarily difficult for people in Opposition who have legitimate concerns for the country to get any information or briefing from any of the four principal agencies, the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and the NTMA, so that we are left to follow events through leaks to the newspaper.I understand, for instance, that the debts are to stay in the banks, in a bad debts division——

Could the Minister outline his intentions to the House with regard to the various items of legislation on banking and finance that he has promised?

He suggested there had been no change in the banking sector in Ireland, whatever about the Government.  The position is that of the 12 chairmen and chief executives of the institutions guaranteed last September, seven of them no longer occupy the positions they held at that time.  That is a substantial degree of change in the senior management of the Irish banking system.With regard to taxation, the position is that——

I should tell Deputy Bruton that this is a substantial fiscal achievement and it was secured in relation to expenditure as well as taxation.I will now turn to the other issues raised.  The suggestion that the heads of the NAMA Bill should be circulated to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service in advance of the publication of the legislation is an excellent one.  I will see whether it can be facilitated.  I will communicate further with Deputies Bruton and Burton on that.Legislation to establish and govern the operation of the national asset management agency will be introduced during the summer legislative session.  Initial work on the preparation of the legislation is under way in parallel with preparation for the operation of the agency.  I am considering the establishment of the agency on a non-statutory interim basis with a view to undertaking the initial scoping work required.  This will include work on the assessment of the human resource requirements and potential recruitment process.  I will bring proposals to Government in that regard.On the question of the Central Bank commission and proposals to reform the regulatory system, I outlined details of this in my Budget Statement and would be happy to facilitate whatever discussion Deputies can agree at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service in that regard.  It is important we try to secure all-party agreement on the nature of the regulatory reforms.Sir Andrew Large has been retained to advise on the recruitment process for a new regulator who will be in place before the reform process takes place.  It is important that discussion takes place at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	120	When this debate concluded last night, I was responding to the fine contribution that had been made by Deputy O'Dowd.  I emphasised my agreement with many of the points he had made.  Today, I am happy to restate my full backing for this Bill.  In essence, we all agree with it.  The main purpose of the Bill is to regulate the law and the present practices of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners relating to the secret surveillance of suspects.  It is a sad reflection on the development of society that we have to provide for the secret surveillance of suspects.  If it is deemed necessary, however, it is appropriate that there should be a good and strong legislative basis for it.  This legislation provides such a basis.  Secret surveillance operations can produce valuable intelligence material, not only when serious crimes and subversive activities are being planned but also when offences are being committed and after they have been committed.  Last night, I outlined some of the reasons it is appropriate to make statutory provision for such operations.This Bill will put in place a system whereby the use of surveillance devices during security operations can be authorised and approved.  This legislation is good because it specifies the requirements that must be observed by the various State agencies when they are using such devices.  An authorisation may be issued on foot of an application to a District Court judge.  On the basis of the evidence presented to the court by a superior officer of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners, the judge must be satisfied that the proposed surveillance is necessary and uses the least intrusive method available.  While a judicial authorisation will be generally required before surveillance can take place, the reality is that the exigencies of an individual situation frequently mean that it is not possible to go to court.  Under the terms of the two general exceptions provided for in the Bill, surveillance may be carried out with the approval of a superior officer.  This good and well drafted Bill sets out the specific circumstances in which such a departure from the norm may be permitted.We all understand that in circumstances of exceptional urgency, it may simply not be possible to get court authorisation.  Every reasonable person will accept that if there is an immediate risk of a person evading justice, committing an offence or destroying information or evidence relating to a crime, exceptional circumstances can be said to exist.  In such instances, a senior officer of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners must be satisfied that the proposed surveillance is necessary and uses the least intrusive method available.  There is a strict time limit of 72 hours for the use of approved surveillance.  If the surveillance is to continue beyond that period, authorisation must be sought from a judge within the 72 hours in question.  This is a prudent measure.  In such circumstances, the senior officer who approved the surveillance will be required under this legislation to make a report to a more senior officer — an assistant commissioner, a general officer or an assistant secretary — on all aspects of the approval.  The report will summarise the surveillance that was conducted.  The other set of circumstances in which an approval, rather than an authorisation, will be required will be when tracking devices are used to provide information on the location of a person, place or thing.  The safeguards that are provided for in this Bill are proportionate.  They offer the necessary balance between privacy rights and the protection of national security.One of the most important features of this Bill is the section that sets out the qualifying criteria which must be fulfilled before surveillance may be used.  It underscores the fact that secret surveillance is only permitted where serious crime is involved and the interference with privacy is proportionate.  Those criteria must be taken into consideration in cases of judicial and non-judicial authorisation.  In that context, I would like to refer briefly to a recent unpleasant personal experience.  I was present at the scene of a crime that was carried out by masked individuals who could not possibly be identified by gardaí at the scene.  I understand that surveillance material on these individuals was available from a place in which they had committed another crime, in the lead-up to the second crime.  It seems to me that it is important to ensure that members of the Garda are not frustrated by excessive regulation.  I recall speaking about the viciousness of the crime I witnessed.  I referred particularly to the manner in which some of the young women who were working where the crime took place were treated.Deputy Costello agreed with me last night when I said there is something extraordinarily vicious and almost inhumane about the crimes carried out by gangs.  Members of the Garda have told me it is frustrating to have to fight crime with one hand tied behind their backs.  The surveillance arrangements we are providing for will help to liberate the Garda, while offering specific protections to prevent future abuses.  It is good and prudent that proper records will have to be kept of the details of approvals and operations and that complaints procedures are being provided for.If a breach of the operation of the legislation takes place, it is right that the relevant authorisation or approval may be quashed and an order for compensation may be made.  I am glad there will be judicial oversight of the use of the authorisation procedure and the conduct of autonomous emergency Garda operations.  It is appropriate that a judge of the High Court will be appointed to keep this legislation under review and to report to the Taoiseach, who will ensure copies of such reports are laid before the Oireachtas.As an aside, I wonder if our High Court judges should be so encumbered — perhaps we should find people outside the High Court to do these things.  There are strict rules governing the storage and disclosure of material gathered from surveillance.  If material is collected for one purpose, it is important that it should not be used for another.  I have already mentioned that the Bill addresses crucial issues such as the disclosure of evidence and operations, to protect the integrity, effectiveness and security of Garda methods and operations.Overall, the Minister has produced a fine Bill.  The Garda Commissioner has advised him that a new approach is needed in light of the kind of serious crime the force has been dealing with over recent times.  Deputy O'Dowd referred graphically last night to instances of gangland activity.  Drug empires have been built.  Threats have been made by subversive elements in our society.  It can be difficult to get strong evidence against the godfathers of crime.  This Bill provides a new approach and represents a change of policy.  Up to now, it has not been the practice to use the results of secret surveillance in evidence.  Quite rightly, the courts have been careful to avoid the use of such evidence.  The balance has now been tipped to the point that this exceptional step needs to be taken.  The availability of information, including aural recordings, about planning meetings, the context of such meetings, the individuals involved and the places discussed, could be of crucial importance in supporting criminal charges, particularly if direct evidence is weak or inconclusive or, as we have seen in recent times, there is a real and physical threat to decent citizens who would otherwise be available to provide evidence.  This Bill is a necessary part of the ongoing fight against gangland activity and other serious crime.  It should and will enjoy the support of all Members of this House and the other House.  I wish the Minister and his Department well in processing the legislation.

Having listened to a good few Deputies speaking on this legislation, it appears that it is getting universal approval.The most shocking statistic I have heard is that the perpetrators of just 12% of the fatal shootings that have taken place over the past 11 years have been brought to justice.  It is obvious that the efforts that have been made to apprehend such people have not been successful.  The insidious intimidation of people in the heartlands of Dublin and Limerick is now spreading all over the country.  Intimidation is a dreadful thing when it gets into people's minds.  A ripple effect makes people afraid to trust even those who live beside them.  We know about intimidation following the Troubles in Northern Ireland but the intimidation now is insidious and getting worse by the hour.Like every other legislator here I believe in the rule of law, the book of evidence, the jury system and so on.  The problem is that many involved in the sort of crime for which this legislation is intended successfully spread rumours saying they think someone rang the Garda Síochána confidential line, irrespective of whether anyone did.  I hope that none of us will ever be subject to this kind of intimidation.  We have a responsibility to protect people who are good, just and genuinely want to do well.  They are to be found everywhere, even in the heart of gangland slums.  We do not give enough time in this House to the psychology used in those areas to frighten the living daylights out of people.  People saw on television the person in Limerick giving the fingers to everybody.  He was a young fellow whose name I forget but I will never forget that image, which said that as far as he and his friends are concerned, they care for nobody.Any interference with the jury system is very serious because we are proud of that system and most of the time it works very well.  Once the people at whom this legislation is aimed cross the line in the sand we must do much more than is contained in this Bill.  I agree entirely with the contents of the Bill but the minute we talk about bugging devices and so on we can rest assured that the people on whom they will be used will use the same system or a more sophisticated one to block those devices.  The thugs have the money and are able to pay for the brains.  They would not do it themselves.  They are going through the legislation line by line, as we speak.  They might not be able to defeat it legally, or at least I hope not.  I hope the legislation will hold up.  I am not a legal expert so I can only believe what I am told in that regard.It is right that the Garda, the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners should be able to do these things now because we have a serious problem.  They will, for instance, be able to break into houses or other buildings and put in all sorts of state-of-the-art bugging devices.  It is possible that the flower pot will have a bug in it and the bed post might have one.

#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The James Bond films will be nothing compared with what those guys get up to when they get going.  We need to ensure that we can instill confidence in the public that the Government and the establishment of law and order will prevail.  I know they will but many people are disconnected.  One would want to be very naive to believe, for example, that a witness protection programme in any state could really protect one because all the people involved in a crime know where the witness is placed, no matter what name he or she is given.This Bill will help but it will not change what is happening because the problem was allowed go too far.  We know that there is a major disconnect among people in many housing estates.  People do not like to say so publicly but there are many areas outside the bad areas of Dublin, Limerick and other cities which the gardaí are not allowed to enter.  That is a bad start.  Whatever went wrong with the way the Garda management conducts its business, under Government direction, over the past ten or 12 years the concept of the community garda was forgotten.  If we do not get information about what is happening on the ground in the best and worst areas we will not have it when we need it most.Even the worst criminals start small and continue if they get away with anti-social behaviour and so on.  I appreciate that many of them come from broken homes where their parents could not care less whether they are in jail or go to school.  That is a serious problem for society.  Even with the major cutbacks that we must endure over the next few years there should be no reduction in the local activity of the Garda and the intelligence they can gather at community level.  As soon as the Garda payroll is cut the problems start.  I have never seen a crime being solved or information gathered from a squad car, it is always done on a personal basis by the community garda.  Vicious crimes are a different matter.  I started my career as a youth officer and I fully appreciate, as most Members do, that the trouble starts at that level but we cannot wait for the evolution of today's youth.  While we must work with them we have to take on the other guys now in every shape and form.I thank the Oireachtas Library for the Bills Digest which provides an excellent resumé of many parts of this Bill that I do not have time to go through.  It is an excellent document.The Bill strikes the balance between the right of the individual and the right of the public to go about its daily business in the community.I wish to refer to the problem of intimidation.  The current backdrop to this country reminds me of Seán O'Casey's play "The Shadow of a Gunman".  There are so many people, particularly those connected with the drugs trade, who genuinely believe that if they are ruthless in intimidating all around them and act as armchair generals, they can make people do the dirty work for them, and they will become immensely rich.  There is no doubt the drug culture is at the centre of all this.  The average age of those involved in the drugs trade has fallen significantly over the years.  Many of them in so-called influential positions, who are pulling the strings, are in their early twenties.  It is chilling to think of what they are capable of doing.  A few years ago, it used to be said that at least those involved were 15 or 20 years older and that they tended not be as austere, harsh or ruthless as the people who are there now.To take a typical case, a person may arrive in charge of a patch at a young age, from a poor background and with no social skills or education.  Nonetheless, that person will have access to millions of euro, and one can imagine what such a person will do to keep control of his so-called kingdom.  Against that background, the Bill seeks to allow the Garda Síochána to infiltrate those particular circles.  We hope it will do so.  It is important to be able to infiltrate these gangs, charge their members in court, obtain convictions and put them behind bars.More importantly, it will send a signal to the community and to the public at large that if people engage in such activity, they will be caught.  Given that only 12% of them were caught in the past 11 years, they can say it is worth their while because there is an almost 90% chance they will not do time in prison.  Unless those figures are changed and we get better results, the problem will multiply.  It will happen anywhere there is this sort of loot, which ordinary people cannot imagine.  The Saturday night lottery win is nothing compared to what those guys are dealing with.  Unless we can infiltrate that terrible circle we will be in for a woeful whirlwind over the next four or five years.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I thank Deputy Connaughton for allowing me to use some of his time slot.  Fine Gael has been calling for some time for such legislation.  We think it is critical in the fight against crime and in recent years we have proposed a number of measures to aid conviction rates against criminals.  A raft of legislation has been introduced in both Houses and there have been strong statements on how effective it will be, but I hope no loopholes will be found in this Bill.  Deputy Connaughton referred to this but I hope the legislation has been well proofed so that criminals will not be able to avail of any loopholes.Evidence garnered from the use of mobile phones will be critical when used in court.  At present, gardaí can listen in to such conversations and gather information but it cannot be used to obtain a conviction.  That is what it comes down to.  According to available statistics, only 12% of the 171 shootings that have taken place in the past decade have resulted in convictions.  That is a very poor result.  Additional resources will have to made available for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda national surveillance unit to ensure the effectiveness of the Bill when enacted. Fine Gael has been calling for some time for the establishment of a DNA database, which has been discussed in committee.  There should be a European database and the sooner one is introduced, the better.I wish to refer to what is happening in Limerick in particular.  The Bill is a response to gangland crime in Limerick and Dublin, but more so in Limerick, given what has happened recently, including murder and the intimidation of witnesses and other innocent people.  Unfortunately, this is no longer a Limerick problem because the Limerick gangs and their associates have developed vast networks all over the region.  I am particularly aware of this since I live in the neighbouring county of Kerry.  These gangs are now developing their networks from Tralee northwards through Listowel, into west Limerick, Abbeyfeale, Glin and other places.  It is only a matter of time before they are fighting for their own turf in those areas to defend the networks they have set up.  If this is not curbed, we could have a regional problem, rather than a local one in Limerick.  The situation is currently controlled by gangs and their associates in Limerick.  Families have been mentioned in the city in this regard, but the problem is much bigger than those families because they do not have total control of the drugs trade there.  People think it is all controlled by a few tightly-knit families, but it is even bigger than that.  Obviously there are rich pickings and the movement of traffic in the Shannon Estuary provides an easily accessible point for the importation of drugs.It is my duty as a politician to express my concern about what I see.  In addition, I am receiving information from Garda sources on what is happening in towns such as Listowel and Tralee where there is a ready supply of drugs coming from Limerick city.  There is major control by gangs in those areas, which is sophisticated and fairly well organised.I welcome this Bill which we have been seeking for some time.  I hope the necessary resources will be put in place to ensure its effectiveness.  It is just another weapon in the fight against criminals who are really challenging democracy and the very stability of our country.  This is one aspect upon which we can all unite in this House.  We must take on these criminals, be they in Limerick, Dublin or elsewhere.I welcome the Bill and urge its speedy enactment and implementation.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  I acknowledge the fact that, in 2007, my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, proposed a similar Private Members' Bill.  To some extent, that is the context in which we are discussing this legislation.As some of the advisers present will be aware, following the 2002 general election, Mr. Michael McDowell was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I served as Labour Party spokesperson on justice.  During the former Minister's term in office, he introduced legislation on a serial basis and his Department resembled a factory producing legislation.  The Minister was a flamboyant character who believed legislation, which he introduced almost weekly, would solve every problem.  In 2004, following a gangland killing, he made the now famous remark that the murder was the sting of a dying wasp and he had gangland crime under control.  That year marked a turning point in the sense that the character of drug addiction in Ireland changed from being largely heroin based to being largely cocaine based.  Cocaine has since bypassed heroin, the preferred drug in the capital city since 1970, as the drug of choice.  After three decades of hard drug abuse, heroin distribution networks have spread throughout the country, especially to urban areas, and the problem is largely out of control.Drugs and guns are widely available and form the backdrop to this legislation.  The use and abuse of illicit substances and firearms causes gangland turf wars over profits with the result that gangland activity has become embedded in Irish criminal culture and previously ad hoc criminal activity has become organised.  The largest seizure of gangland weaponry in the history of the State was made in September 2007 when 41 different weapons were seized in a single haul.  The seizure followed a four month international investigation into the activities of leading Dublin and Limerick criminals.  The firearms are believed to have been destined for crime gangs in both cities which had linked up.  The operation involved police and customs services from the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Netherlands.  That is the position as regards guns.Shortly before this seizure of firearms, the largest ever drugs haul in the history of the State, worth approximately €500 million, was made.  Ireland has clearly become a marketplace for drug barons and, as an easy access point, has become a launching pad for the global distribution of drugs.  The world market in drugs is large and lucrative.  According to the United Nations, for example, the illegal drugs trade is a massive global industry with a highly sophisticated international supply chain.  UN figures show that illegal drugs account for 8% of world trade and are worth more than the combined global market for textiles, clothing, iron and steel.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimates the global illicit drug market was worth $400 billion in 2003.  Of more than 200 million drug users worldwide, those using cannabis, marijuana, hashish — THC — accounted for the largest number, at 162 million users, while the numbers using amphetamines, methamphetamines and ecstasy is estimated at 35 million.  The number of users of opiates — opium, morphine, heroin and synthetic opiates — is estimated to be 60 million, while some 30 million people use cocaine.In 2007, the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board noted some emerging trends in its annual report, including the emergence of new drug smuggling routes into Europe, in particular, the practice of stockpiling and repackaging cocaine from South America in west Africa before it enters Europe.  Ireland is one of the ports of call for the introduction of cocaine into the European market.The report also noted the increased cultivation of coca bushes, from which cocaine is derived, in Peru and Bolivia as crop eradication programmes reduce production in Columbia.  It noted a 17% increase in illicit opium poppy cultivation during 2007 in Afghanistan, the country which currently accounts for 93% of the global market in opiates.  In light of the ongoing war in Afghanistan, it is incredible that the United States and other members of the international community involved in the war have not been able to curb the cultivation of opium.  The sale of opium to the West is one of the reasons for the Taliban's success.  It is ironic that profits generated from this activity are used to fund arms purchases for the Taliban.The context in which the legislation has been introduced is, therefore, the growing drugs problem, both at an international level and domestically.  I am well aware of how communities in my local area have been destroyed by drugs over the years.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, will be aware from his area that the use of drugs is a major contributory factor in anti-social behaviour and many other forms of serious criminality in our communities.  The drugs problem has become embedded.  For example, 75% of those who are sent to our overcrowded jails have drug problems.  Moreover, the activities of the Garda are strongly focused on combating drugs because the profile of criminality has changed dramatically over the years.It is essential that secret or covert surveillance becomes a major tool for law enforcement agencies in acquiring information which, under this legislation, they will be able to use as evidence in court to secure convictions.  The purpose of the Bill is to facilitate this process by providing a statutory basis for the conduct of covert surveillance by law enforcement agencies not only in the area of justice, but also by the Defence Forces and Revenue Commissioners.  It also provides a formal approval process with which the relevant agencies must comply if the subsequent surveillance is to be deemed legal.  It introduces oversight and regulatory safeguards to try to preserve the confidentiality necessary for the successful use of surveillance and provides for the admissibility in criminal proceedings of covertly gathered information.This legislation gives the authorities powers to plant bugging devices, enter premises and introduce tracking devices.  Information gathered in this way may be used in court in the fight against crime.  Law abiding citizens and the State must be protected from criminal and subversive threats.  As I noted, the use of good policing and proper approaches in earlier years would have allowed us to address the issue sooner.  The problem is now out of control and requires the introduction of new tools and mechanisms of this nature to protect citizens and the State.  At the same time, the right of law abiding citizens to private enjoyment of their home without State interference and intrusion is paramount.  Citizens' rights are strongly protected in the Constitution, which guarantees citizens' right to privacy and personal rights, and in domestic law since the incorporation in law of the European Convention of Human Rights in 2003.Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights upholds very strongly the citizen's right to respect for private and family life, home and correspondence, without interference.  The relevant section of Article 8 states everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, home and correspondence, that there should be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right, except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of rights and freedoms of others.  It is a comprehensive statement on the protection of the rights and privacy of the individual citizen.This Bill seeks to balance the intrusive nature of the activity envisaged in it and the trust in many of its provisions and provides safeguards to protect against abuse.  For example, prior authorisation for surveillance by a District Court is required and this measure is welcome.  Authorisation is provided for a three month basis and a longer period requires a fresh application, all of which is proper and correct.  Secure storage of the data and authorised access is required to access that data, which is designed to protect privacy and the other rights of the person involved.The complaints mechanism to be put in place for citizens and compensation of €5,000 and-or a referral to the Garda Ombudsman Commission where contravention of the surveillance powers occur are provided for and are appropriate.  The appointment of a High Court judge is envisaged to oversee the operation of the Bill and make regular reports to the Minister which will be presented on the floor of this House.  All such provisions are highly desirable.However, there are two sections of the Bill which open the door to abuse regarding these new powers.  Section 7 makes provision for a superior officer to give approval for surveillance for up to 72 hours without recourse to an application to the District Court.  This provision is permitted where, for whatever reason, time is of the essence.  It is fairly difficult to imagine a situation whereby an officer would not have access to the courts over a period of 72 hours, which is three full days.  It is difficult to justify having a three day provision.  A weekend, which is 48 hours, is one thing but 72 hours envisages not just a weekend but virtually half a week where the courts would not be accessible.  I would like the Minister to outline the justification for that period.This proposal is something of a lazy officer's provision, and can be easily abused and used for what we often hear barristers in court call "fishing expeditions".  Surveillance may not be required to the same degree or it may not be easy for the particular officer to stand up for evidence that would pass muster in the District Court before a judge to get such covert surveillance.If one plans to interfere with a person's privacy and home, and trespass and use tracking or bugging devices it is very important the mechanisms in place are foolproof to ensure there is no abuse, because such evidence will subsequently be used in court.  That is the intention.  This is designed to provide flexibility, but the danger is that this is the lazy officer's way out and will be abused.Section 14, which is described in the explanatory memorandum as a core provision of the Bill, is very worrying.  It provides for the admissibility of evidence which has been obtained by means of surveillance, even in circumstances where a law has been breached.  We have seen how such issues come up in the courts and the amount of hassle and damage this can do to the process.The explanatory memorandum, which puts the operation of this section in a stark fashion, states section 14 is a core provision of the Bill.  That is a bad sign.  It further states the section, "deals with the issue of admissibility of evidence in the narrow and very specific context of evidence obtained by means of surveillance", in other words, evidence obtained under the provisions of this Bill, and it goes on to state:It provides that such evidence, notwithstanding any error or omission on the face of an authorisation or a written record of approval, or notwithstanding any failure by any member/officer to comply with a requirement of an authorisation or written record, is admissible in certain clearly defined circumstances as set out in the section.It then drives the point home by stating, "In effect, this means that a breach of statute-based procedures or a failure to fulfil particular statutory requirements will not, of themselves, mean that the material in question must be excluded".This is a dangerous provision to include in the Bill.  It is too wide, general and open to question, and is also too open to abuse.  If an officer knows, as a last resort, that he or she will be able to present evidence in court, even if they breach the law or authorisation they are given, or do not comply with what they are obliged to do by law, they can proceed as though they had not breached it.I am concerned about the broad nature of section 14.  It seems to be an open-ended invitation for the relevant authorities engaged in the investigation to take shortcuts and become lax in their procedures.  If there is a facility to do that it will happen and, as time goes by, the procedures will become looser and looser, there will be more breaches of them and the entirety of the legislation will be thrown into disrepute.  There will be costly wrangles in the courts.  These two areas require tightening up, otherwise I envision a situation whereby the Constitution will be breached, there will be constitutional cases, the European Convention on Human Rights will be infringed and people will go to European as well as domestic courts.In recent times, we have become aware of the case of Mr. Ciaran Boylan, which I raised in this House and outside it.  I understand the Leas-Cheann Comhairle raised it in 2006 and 2007.  It is going on for as long as that.  It demonstrates the manner in which a law enforcement agency can go astray in its fight against crime and drag the component parts of the criminal justice system into a very unsavoury situation.  The improper use of Mr. Boylan, a notorious drug dealer, by members of the Garda in their law enforcement capacity and activities, has embroiled the Director of Public Prosecutions, the courts, the Garda Síochána, the Garda Ombudsman Commission and even the Department of Transport.If correct procedures were followed and the law was strictly observed, a convicted drug dealer would now not be in possession of an international haulage licence, which he is, and which facilitates the drug importation and possession of which he has already been convicted.  Neither would he be free to walk the streets but would instead be serving a minimum sentence of ten years.  It is very easy for the proper procedures to be breached, unless the regulations are very tight, even though the best intentions are laid down in law.  The result is that the entire criminal justice system comes into disrepute.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Tá áthas orm labhairt ar an Bhille tábhachtach seo.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the topic of the new Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.As every Deputy in the House is aware, there is hardly a village in the country that has not been affected to some extent by drugs.  I welcome the fact that all Deputies whose contributions I have heard, and, probably, all other Deputies, will support this Bill.  It is one of the most important Bills that will have been passed for some time.  I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, and formally congratulate him on his re-election.  While this Bill is sponsored by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it deals with an issue that constitutes the biggest threat to our society at the moment, which is drugs.  The Minister of State is playing an important role in introducing his new drugs and alcohol strategy, which we will all welcome.Not since the 1970s and 1980s when we had the threat to the State from IRA activities have we had the need for special legislation to deal with a crisis such as this.  There is nobody in Ireland who does not abhor the ruthless killing of criminals and also, unfortunately, innocent victims.  As I go about my constituency canvassing with my local councillors and candidates, I can see that this Bill is very much in the public eye.  People have commented on the necessity for it and they believe the detail of the Bill is needed to help gardaí in their important work.  The Garda Síochána itself has been calling for it.  Deputy Rabbitte mentioned yesterday that the Garda was not in favour of the provisions of this Bill.  I do not think he really meant to say that because I know from speaking to the Garda Commissioner and from the gardaí in my own constituency that drugs are the biggest problem they face.  The Garda Síochána wants to see this legislation enacted because it has not been able to get convictions due to lack of evidence and witness intimidation.  If witnesses are intimidated they will feel less inclined to co-operate with gardaí because of the real threat to their lives and, unfortunately, to their families.If we go back to the 1970s and 1980s, when the Special Criminal Court was brought in, we saw direct results whereby the courts were able to make convictions and take hardened terrorists off our streets.  The peace process that followed was facilitated by our being able to deal with those people who, for a time, seemed to be able to go about with immunity, use arms and so on.  The threat to our legal and courts system at the moment is of paramount importance.  Deputy Connaughton referred to a young thug from Limerick who gave two fingers to gardaí, and to society, when leaving a court some years ago.  The population at large is appalled to see such things.  We do not expect that such people, whom I regard as scumbags, should be able to show disrespect for our court system.  It is frustrating for the gardaí who have to deal with those individuals to see them walk out of court on some technicality or due to lack of evidence.  Among the people I have spoken to, nobody wants to see such behaviour.  Most genuine citizens regard it as appalling that young pups can show such disregard for our gardaí and our legal systems.Many speakers yesterday were from the two areas most affected by gangland crime, Limerick and Dublin.  While my own constituency of Dublin North has not had the same number of killings, there have been some, and bodies have been dumped in the more rural parts.  We must pay tribute to the efforts of the Garda up to now.  Despite the problems of presenting concrete evidence in court and witnesses not being forthcoming, it has succeeded in achieving quite a number of successful prosecutions.  We must commend it for that.  Once this legislation is passed, the Garda will be able to bring criminals to court in a much faster and more efficient manner.  The sooner we can take these evil monsters away from society, the better.Surveillance equipment has been used abroad for quite some time.  If one watches not only television programmes, but even foreign news programmes, one will frequently see how courts have dealt successfully with hardened criminals.  It is regrettable that Ireland is at this stage, but it is the reality.  We cannot live with the situation any longer; we must make hard decisions and give the Garda the necessary facilities to enable it to do its work.  We expect our police to be one step ahead of criminals.  It is ridiculous that people can avoid prosecution on technicalities and, in particular, that they can intimidate witnesses and question the evidence gardaí produce on frivolous grounds.  Unfortunately, our court system must deal in hard facts.  That is why this Bill is so necessary.The sad fact one realises when reading court cases and so on is that often the evidence is not sufficient, in legal terms, to convict a person of a crime.  Under the provisions of this Bill, where a crime has been committed and everyone knows it has been committed — such as a tiger kidnapping, robbery or shooting — and where we have good surveillance equipment, the Garda will be in a position to achieve a successful prosecution.  To judge from the way surveillance was used in the 1970s and 1980s against subversives, this new law will be a success.  The Garda Síochána wants the extra resources because it needs to deal with drug barons.Another area in which I feel surveillance will help is among the known contacts of criminals.  When speaking to gardaí in my own area of Dublin North, and when I attend neighbourhood watch meetings and meetings of the joint policing board, with which I am involved, the gardaí will often mention that they know certain people are attached to a recognised criminal.  It is galling from their perspective that they cannot apprehend those individuals.  This legislation will strengthen the role of the Garda by enabling it to put such contacts under surveillance.  Regrettably, when the leader of a gang is killed, there is always a replacement to step into that person's shoes.  If the Garda eliminates those contacts who are second in command and so on, this will help to remove the drug problem in our society.  Surveillance is an effective means of achieving that.There have been too many innocent victims of gangland violence.  This society can no longer tolerate a situation where a law-abiding citizen such as Shane Geoghegan in Limerick, who happens to look like somebody else, is shot dead.  We must do everything we can to reduce the number of such incidents.  There is nothing that sickens people more than the murder of an innocent victim who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.The Garda must be given whatever support it requires to deal with tit-for-tat revenge killings.  Members of the various rival gangs are known to the Garda but without hard evidence, no action can be taken against them.  This legislation will enable gardaí to be more proactive in this regard.  When a gangland member is killed, one can be almost certain that a member of the rival gang will be killed within days or weeks.  I have no doubt the Bill will facilitate the Garda in pre-empting such retaliatory killings.It was good to see so many young people in the Gallery earlier.  Parents must be far more vigilant in monitoring where their teenagers are and what they are doing.

#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	130	We would hope so.  As I recall from my own experience, our society has always had a problem with under age drinking, although it may be worse now than ever before.  What is different from the past is that drugs are now part of many young people's lives.  Much of this comes down to parental control and supervision.  It is particularly regrettable that some young people who take drugs go on to become drug pushers and ultimately hoods who have no problem with carrying guns.  Parents must bring their influence to bear on their children.  The recent newspaper reports about the 14 year old in Limerick who was arrested wearing a bulletproof vest are indicative of the mindset of some young people.  A 14 year old should be wearing his or her club colours or school uniform, not a bulletproof vest.  It is reprehensible to discover there are teenagers wearing bulletproof vests and carrying firearms which they may be willing to use.  Young people should be encouraged to become involved in sport and other youth activities within their communities.  A teenager from Limerick should be thinking about the Munster rugby team or the Limerick hurling and football teams instead of who he or she intends to shoot or maim.Communities must be proactive in terms of observing what is happening in their midst.  For example, many drug barons live in apartments in urban areas from which they run their drugs empires.  Local residents should be more observant of people who do not interact with them and whose activities are clearly suspicious.  While neighbourhood watch schemes have always been used to counteract petty crime, they can also be useful in monitoring more serious issues such as drug dealing.I read a newspaper report today which described how a well-known gang burgled several premises in Tipperary and Limerick yesterday.  Following a high-speed chase, those involved were apprehended by gardaí in Limerick.  Two vehicles were written off and there were three arrests.  The gardaí were aware of the identity of these people but are constrained in the actions they can take against them.  If the surveillance measures provided for in this legislation were in place, these individuals might already have been in prison instead of being free to ransack the countryside and put other motorists at risk.  It is fortunate that they were apprehended and that neither of the gardaí involved in the car chase was injured, even though their car was written off.  It is no longer acceptable that individuals who are known to the Garda are at liberty to go on a rampage of looting and shooting.I read in recent days that the family of the late Roy Collins in Limerick is now receiving death threats, presumably from the same scumbag thugs who killed their loved one.  This type of intimidation can no longer be tolerated.  That is why tough legislation is required.  I welcome the broad support for the Bill from most human rights groups.  These little scumbag pups cannot be allowed to dictate to our society.Earlier this week, a public meeting organised by residents of Dolphin House flats in Dolphin's Barn to discuss drug dealing in the estate was disrupted when local gardaí received a telephone call stating that a bomb had been planted on the premises.  Sure enough, a pipe bomb was found outside the building.  The thugs operating in this estate are painting the names of community gardaí working in the area on walls and buildings.  This Bill must be put in place as soon as possible so that such individuals can be brought to justice.  The sooner these drug barons and all their accomplices are behind bars the better.  Law-abiding people will welcome the introduction of this legislation.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	131	All law abiding citizens will support, in principle, legislation, as cited in the Long Title to the Bill, "to provide for surveillance in connection with the investigation of arrestable offences, the prevention of suspected arrestable offences and the safeguarding of the State against subversive and terrorist threats".  Everyone is in favour of the principle but my concern is that the devil may be in the detail.  It is important, therefore, that the Bill navigate a passage among the restrictions and limitations in the fundamental rights articles of the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights — particularly Article 8 providing for the right to privacy — and the precedents laid down by Supreme Court decisions, particularly regarding the exclusionary rule.  While I support the view that anything we can do to put drugs barons, crooks and criminals behind bars, it is important that it is done properly.  My comments on the Bill are related to that concern because otherwise, convictions will be set aside and the criminals will not go to prison.The Garda has always engaged in surveillance, and rightly so.  Surveillance is a fundamental job of a police force.  We constantly demand intelligence led policing and surveillance is a part of that.  There is a national surveillance unit in the Garda Síochána.  In analogy to the Hippocratic oath, in passing legislation we must first take care to do no harm.  I hope the present surveillance operations will not be limited or reduced by the Bill.Section 1 defines surveillance as the "monitoring, observing, listening to or making a recording of a particular person or group of persons or their movements, activities and communications".  That is probably what is taught to Garda recruits on their first day in Templemore.  It is a basic part of the job of a garda and seems to make sense.  However, section 3 states "a member of the Garda Síochána, a member of the Defence Forces or an officer of the Revenue Commissioners shall carry out surveillance only in accordance with a valid authorisation [that would be under section 4] or an approval granted in accordance with section 7 or 8”.  That is clear and specific.  Will normal surveillance will be stopped as a consequence of that very clear and specific section?  I am worried about the framing of section 3 and I urge the experts in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General to have another look at it.Other provisions in the Bill may get around what appears to be a blanket restriction on any surveillance, other than with an authorisation granted under sections 7 or 8, or a valid authorisation.  Subsection 2(2) states:  "Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful any activity that would otherwise be lawful".  This could be used as a general point.  I do not know.  There may be a saver in subsection 14(2), which states: "Nothing in this Act is to be construed as prejudicing the admissibility of information or material obtained otherwise than as a result of surveillance carried out under an authorisation or under an approval granted in accordance with section 7 or 8”.One could argue that what seems clear and specific in section 3 could be got around.  My main concern is that we may be creating a lawyers' picnic here.  We may find lawyers defending serious criminals and, while merely doing their job, using the provisions of the Bill to have certain evidence excluded from the court.  I raise this matter not by way of criticism but in a genuine effort to point out a possible route around the provisions of the legislation which could cause severe havoc and damage to the normal Garda activities of surveillance and the giving of evidence.  I suggest that this point be looked at carefully to see if a recasting or reframing of the Bill might be necessary.Every law abiding citizen will be supportive of legislation which deals with the problem of serious crime.  While the number of indictable offences — now referred to as headline offences — has not increased substantially, the violence component within the figures has increased.  I had a major difference of opinion with a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the former Deputy Michael McDowell, on this point.  A number of journalists also seem to think one should simply accept the figures as they are.  When dealing with figures I operate on the basis that there are lies, damned lies and statistics.  To get a picture of what is happening one must go behind the figures.The serious violence component of the crime statistics has increased substantially.

I recently tabled a parliamentary question requesting the number of murders recorded in the last ten years in which a firearm was used and the number which resulted in proceedings and convictions.  The figures confirmed the point I am making.  In the years 1998 to 2009, the number of murders recorded were four in 1998; 12 in 1999; 12 in 2000; nine in 2001; ten in 2002; 19 in 2003; eight in 2004; 22 in 2005; 26 in 2006; 18 in 2007; 21 in 2008; and 11 in 2009 to date.  The conviction rate is very worrying.  The conviction figures for the same period are: one in 1998; five in 1999; one in 2000; one in 2001; three in 2002; one in 2003; three in 2004; two in 2005; two in 2006; and none in 2007, 2008 or 2009.  In those ten years, firearms were used in 172 murders resulting in 19 convictions.There is something seriously wrong here.

#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I know there are problems regarding evidence and so on.  In any serious situation one will come up against problems.  Our job is to try to find solutions.  That means accepting there is a serious problem and being prepared to find a solution.I would like a new examination of how we categorise crime.  There should be some way to categorise violent crime and serious crime that is not just indictable crime carrying a penalty of more than five years.  We need some way to make things clear so that the Members of this House, the Government of the day — I am not sure how long this one will last — and the public will be reminded of the extent of the problem and the need to confront it.Another worrying development is the growth of regional enclaves.  The Garda would object if I said these places were "no-go areas", as it is an incorrect description.  Where drug lords, crime barons and vicious criminals are the overlords in the area and hold sway to a considerable extent over the decent people in the community, we must sit up and take notice.  Unfortunately, the town of Limerick, which is a capital as far as rugby is concerned, is also a byword for areas where these people have considerable sway.  There are other parts of the country in a similar situation, including parts of this city.  We must accept that these people are effectively outside the law.  When I was young and I read stories about the wild west, such people were known as outlaws.  These people today are outlaws as they do not respect the rule of law.We are facing a huge threat to our society, and I do not think we have confronted it adequately.  We must mobilise all our forces to do so.  We did it when there was a threat from the IRA.  That organisation was attempting to subvert the State and its institutions because it did not recognise its courts and so on.  It was confronted and a common view was formed among most elected representatives at the time that it had to be confronted.  A similar attitude must be taken to this problem, which means accepting that the threat is there and that there is no simple solution to it, but looking at the component parts of the solution.  There is no simplistic way such as internment.  I do not think it worked during the last period of subversion of the State and I do not think it will work this time.  We must try to work within the rule of law, change the law as required and provide the resources as required.  That is the only way.We need to look at where we can improve the law, which includes serious consideration of this Bill, which I accept is an honest effort.  However, there are many other areas to be examined.  Why are we so dilatory and tardy in doing the things that everybody accepts should be done when it comes to law reform?  DNA is a marvellous tool in the fight against crime, so why have we not got the database, the forensic laboratory or the legislation required?  I do not want to hop political footballs, but we are constantly told that great work is being done and then we get the legislative programme every session, in which we are told that the legislation required is expected by Christmas.  Is that Christmas 2009 or when?  I have always taken an interest in this issue.  I looked back over the legislative programme over the past few years and I found the criminal justice (DNA database) Bill, which was to provide for the establishment of a DNA database and was expected to be published in 2006.  I know there are problems with recent legislation — there is also a case in the UK — but our job is to get over these problems and we must mobilise a much more urgent effort to overcome them.The same issue arises regarding procedural reform.  There are references to the Special Criminal Court.  I do not know whether the use of the Special Criminal Court for gangland crime is the panacea that some people think it is.  If it will provide an improvement, I am all for it.  That court was mainly necessary due to the intimidation of jurors.  The problem with gangland crime has not mainly been about intimidation of jurors, but rather intimidation of witnesses, although I am open to correction on this.  If it will help, bring it on.  If there are constitutional problems, as the Taoiseach hinted recently, then we should hear about them so we can find a solution to them.  We have a committee dealing with the Constitution and if there are problems, this is a useful forum in which we can confront them and find a solution.  Let us not just be broadly hinting at and talking about a solution.  If the Special Criminal Court is part of the solution, then let us agree on it.  If there are problems, let us overcome them.I have also been in favour of electronic tagging.  I can recall some interesting discussions about this, including discussions with the current Leas-Cheann Comhairle when he talked about the technical difficulties at the time.  There are technical difficulties in dealing with electronic tagging, but they have been overcome in other countries.  Ultimately, we succeeded in getting legislative provision for electronic tagging, but where are the electronic tags?  We must have invisible electronic tags.  Putting the legislation in place is only half the job.  If there are technical problems, then we should overcome them as was done in other countries.  Why have we not overcome them?  Let us have the complete package and let us put it into operation.I know that the country is half bankrupt from the activities of Fianna Fáil for the last ten years, but——

I know there are limitations on resources, but if there are difficulties, then we should redirect resources from areas of lower priority.  I understand that there are difficulties in the office of the DPP and that we are putting pressure on that office to get more of these people behind bars.  We must go through the proper processes and court procedures, so the DPP must be given the appropriate resources, if necessary by redirection from some other less important area.

This House should also give it priority in terms of resources and there should be a common view to mobilise these resources to ensure that the curse that has befallen parts of our major towns and cities in this country is lifted.  We must ensure that those who have blighted those areas are deservedly put behind bars.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I would like to start by offering my congratulations to Deputy Dara Calleary on his appointment as Minister of State.  I wish him well in his new role and I am sure he will do us proud.The surveillance of criminals is one of the cornerstones of good police work.  The recent increase in gangland crime and the renewal of terrorist activity has tested the ability of the Garda Síochána to ensure a safe and secure society.  I listened with interest to the contributions of my colleagues on the other side of the House.  Deputy Durkan is not behind the door on the Order of Business every morning in reminding us of our shortcomings as regards the number of Bills being presented.  I commend him on his ongoing efforts.  We are bringing forward a number of Bills and I am sure he will be gracious enough to acknowledge this and that we are doing our best to move forward these Bills to create a fairer and better society.The past few years have seen significant advances in the range of surveillance equipment available to the police forces and intelligence agencies internationally.  Many of these advances are as a result of the reaction of the United States to the terrorist actions perpetrated on 11 September 2001, and since then billions of euro have been spent world-wide by governments in an effort to increase the capabilities of surveillance equipment.The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights heard a very interesting presentation this morning about European expenditure on security.  The debate on security issues can be difficult as many people regard security as a dirty business, but it does not have to be like that.  The biggest aspect of security is the protection of the citizen and the State.  There are growing job opportunities in the continuing development of the security industry here in Ireland.  I would prefer to see an informed rather than a reactionary debate on security.  The European Union has a large budget and continues to invest heavily in the security of the Union.  This may present an opportunity for Ireland to get its slice of the pie in terms of shared ideas and expertise both from the agricultural sector and as a result of our experience with the Troubles in the North and how the peace process was dealt with.  There are many areas in which Ireland could contribute to the debate on global and European security.I note the increased sharing of information in recent weeks and days with regard to the pandemic.  It is accepted now that a swine flu pandemic is inevitable.  I understand it is as a result of the high level of security both in the United States and in the EU that we are in a position to react quickly to the threat.  Security is not always about the bad things but rather it is also about many good things.  I acknowledge abuses can occur but it is hoped that security will be put in place to prevent such abuses occurring.  We should seek out the opportunities for Ireland in this sector such as job creation and the development of the industry.In Ireland, the range of surveillance equipment available to the Garda Síochána has also greatly improved over that time and the Garda national surveillance unit has proven particularly effective in the use of this equipment.  Some of the most important victories against organised crime in Ireland in recent years, such as the arrest of leading criminals and large drug seizures, have come about because of the use of electronic surveillance, especially the monitoring of mobile phones.  However, until now the Garda Síochána has been able to use evidence gathered in this manner only as intelligence and an aid to preventing or investigating crime and has not been able to present in court the evidence gathered through electronic surveillance.  The previous speaker alluded to the fact that we have had many gangland killings.  Almost 172 people have been killed but there have been only 19 convictions.  We all know the Sunday newspaper that will tell us within days or hours the names and identities of the individuals who have perpetrated these crimes.  We must ensure our courts are active and this Bill will give us the opportunity to pursue these individuals and ensure they do not get away nor have the freedom they have enjoyed in recent years.  If they commit crime they should do the time.The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill is a significant advance in the fight against subversion and organised crime.  For the first time it will give a legal basis for the administration of electronic surveillance by the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and the Defence Forces and it will provide a legal standing to allow the Garda Síochána to present evidence in court gathered through electronic surveillance.  This Bill will allow Ireland follow the example of many other western countries, including many other EU member countries, in using electronic surveillance to convict criminals in court.  Similar legislation has been in operation in the United States for decades and has proven extremely effective in convicting major players in organised crime in that country.  Many other countries such as Britain, Australia, Sweden and Norway, have similar legislation on their Statute Books.The publication of this Bill has my strong support and I believe the widespread support it has received and the speed with which this House is debating it show a recognition that it is important to have this Bill enacted as soon as possible.  As far back as 1998, the Law Reform Commission called for the introduction of a "flexible, workable system of authorisations" for the surveillance of criminals.  The LRC said at the time that the enforcement of law would be prejudiced if the Garda Síochána did not have a strong legal basis for surveillance.The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill gives this legal basis to the Garda Síochána and strikes a fine balance between the rights of an individual to privacy and the needs of the Garda Síochána to use every legal means at its disposal to combat organised crime.  In a court case in 1987, the then President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton, said that the right to privacy ". . . is not an unqualified right.  Its exercise may be restricted by the constitutional rights of others, or by the requirement of the common good, and is subject to the requirements of public order. . ."  This Bill is a recognition of both the right to privacy of individuals as well as the requirements of the common good.  There is nothing contained in this Bill which would pose a threat to the right to privacy of any law-abiding citizen.A number of years ago the European Commission on Human Rights found that the use of listening devices was not legally binding and could not be used as evidence if there was not a statutory basis for their use.  When this Bill is enacted we will now have that statutory basis for their use in Ireland.  This Bill provides the means to allow the Garda Síochána to secure evidence that is constitutional.One aspect of the Bill I welcome is that it sets out a detailed process for the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the Revenue Commissioners to gather electronic surveillance in a legal manner which can be used as evidence in court.  Authorisation must be granted for surveillance and the person granting it must be satisfied that the surveillance is justified.  The authorisation for surveillance will be normally granted by a District Court judge except in circumstances of extreme urgency.  In cases of extreme urgency, a senior officer of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces or the Revenue Commissioners, can grant an authorisation where he or she is satisfied that all the requirements necessary for authorisation by a judge are fulfilled, that authorisation would be granted by a judge and that the circumstances are urgent, such as the danger that a suspect would abscond or commit a crime or that evidence would be lost.  The time factor is critical.  In cases where an authorisation is granted because of extreme urgency, this authorisation will last for a maximum of 72 hours after which authorisation must be obtained from a judge if the surveillance is to continue.  The extreme urgency mechanism is important and I am glad it has been included in the Bill.  Many other jurisdictions, including Britain, have allowances made for extreme urgency in their legislation.  In Britain, authorisation from a sitting judge is required unless it is not "reasonably practicable" and in Sweden, where surveillance requires a licence, an exemption is given in urgent cases.I previously referred to the right to privacy of an individual citizen.  This Bill contains a number of safeguards to protect individuals from undue investigations into their private affairs.  The Bill allows for the appointment of a referee who will have the power to investigate the operation of the surveillance measures contained in the Bill if an individual believes he or she is the subject of surveillance.  If the referee is of the view there has been a "relevant contravention" of the terms of the Bill, he has the power to rescind the authorisation for surveillance, have the evidence destroyed, award a compensatory payment of up to €5,000 or have the matter referred to the Garda Ombudsman or to the Ministers for Defence or Finance.The Bill also gives a range of powers to the referee to ensure that his or her position cannot be used by an individual to discover whether he or she is actually the subject of a surveillance operation.  When the referee investigates a complaint which he or she finds to be unfounded, he or she will inform the complainant that there has been no breach of the provisions of the Bill in his or her case.  This simply informs the complainant that he or she is not the subject of surveillance which contravenes the Bill.  It does not actually say whether he or she is the subject of surveillance.  Even in cases where the referee finds that surveillance is in contravention of the Bill, the referee has an obligation not to inform the complainant if he or she is of the opinion it would not be in the public interest to do so.The Bill effectively puts the public interest above the rights of the complainant.  These safeguards are important, because without them a criminal could use the position of the referee to discover whether a surveillance operation is taking place and this would undermine the workings of the surveillance.  A further protection afforded under this Bill is the appointment of a High Court judge who will monitor the implementation of this Bill and act in a supervisory capacity.  This judge will report directly to the Taoiseach at least once a year on the operation of the Bill and his or her reports will help to guide Government policy in the future.Another aspect of the Bill to be welcomed is that the admissibility of evidence in court is clearly legislated for.  The result of this Bill will be that evidence gathered through electronic surveillance will be admissible in Irish courts for the first time and the procedures outlined in the Bill will ensure the legality of this evidence.  Evidence obtained through electronic surveillance will be admissible if it has been obtained as the result of an authorisation for surveillance.  The Bill also allows evidence to be admissible even in cases where there was an error in the documents relating to the surveillance if the error was inadvertent and the evidence would serve the interests of justice.  Evidence can also be admissible even when the officer carrying out the surveillance failed to comply with all the requirements of the authorisation if the officer acted in good faith, the failure was inadvertent and the evidence would serve the interests of justice.  These sections of the Bill close off some very important loopholes which could have jeopardised an important investigation and allowed a major criminal figure to walk free from court due to a small technicality.The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill also legislates for the use of tracking devices as opposed to more regular forms of surveillance equipment.  Evidence obtained by tracking the location of mobile phones has been the key piece of evidence in a number of high profile criminal cases in recent years.  Mobile phone records showing that the suspect was at the scene of the crime, or was in the same location as other suspects before the crime took place, have been the difference between guilty and not guilty verdicts.  Expanding the technology used here and allowing gardaí to use tracking equipment will greatly help their ability to prevent and solve major crimes.The most important function of this Bill is to clarify how electronic surveillance can be carried out in a legal manner and how the resultant evidence gathered can be introduced into the courts.  There are many other forms of communication on which we do not have clarification and which should be examined with a view to putting their use and the evidence they produce on a statutory footing.  Evidence gained from surveillance of live Internet activity, Internet telephone services such as Skype, webmail services and CCTV could provide useful evidence for criminal prosecutions.I am particularly familiar with CCTV because I have been involved in efforts to secure funding through the RAPID process to place CCTV cameras in New Ross.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was involved and is a member of the joint policing committee, JPC, in New Ross with me.  We have worked on these cases and are very familiar with the importance of that to all our towns and to the protection of the citizens on our streets and in our public areas.Many communities are facing serious problems with anti-social behaviour and the streets and graveyards of many towns are now no-go areas at certain times day and night.  CCTV cameras would be a useful deterrent against anti-social behaviour and would help to reclaim our streets for law abiding citizens.  They could also provide valuable information to help bring criminal charges or convictions.  However, I would hate to see a situation arise where evidence gained through CCTV footage or some other form of surveillance such as monitoring a Skype telephone call could be ruled inadmissible in court because of a technicality or oversight.  We should consider an overall reform of the law on surveillance, not just electronic surveillance, which would not only put current forms of surveillance on a clear statutory footing but would also give us the power to legally place surveillance on future forms of communications without having to return to the House for more legislation.I will briefly return to the subject of CCTV.  One of its great benefits would be to help prevent physical attacks on emergency services personnel.  I was glad to hear the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outline a number of his proposals for future legislative changes in his speech to the House yesterday.  I urge him, as part of a future legislative package, to introduce a specific offence of attacking a member of the emergency services.  Emergency services personnel, be they firefighters, ambulance personnel or gardaí, carry out a vital role in all our communities.  They are being subjected to serious physical attacks while they are carrying out their jobs and I would like to see this recognised as a stand-alone offence which carries a severe penalty.  We must send a clear message that these attacks are attacks, not just on the emergency services, but on the whole of society and that we will not tolerate them under any circumstances.I commend the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on introducing the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill to the House and I believe its enactment will be of great assistance to gardaí in their day-to-day duty of protecting society.  This Bill is an important move in the fight against terrorists, tackling gangland crime and taking on the major figures in organised crime.  Combined with the measures contained in the recent Criminal Justice Acts, it will give gardaí significant powers to deal with people who, unfortunately, are a plague on our society.

Is é seo an chéad deis a bhí agam comhghairdeas a ghabháil leis an Aire Stáit nua atá i láthair.This is a major piece of legislation.  The bulk of surveillance conducted by law enforcement agencies to date in this State has been unlawful and hence has automatically fallen foul of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Evidence gleaned from such surveillance has, therefore, not been able to assist prosecutions.  We have had the worst of both worlds.  I welcome the publication of this Bill because it will move us towards compliance with our human rights obligation and provide for the related evidence to be used in court, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful prosecutions in some cases.Tacaíonn Sinn Féin leis an mBille seo.  Táimid sásta cuidiú chun an reachtaíocht seo a phlé chomh gasta agus is cóir.  Dar ndóigh, caithfidh an iniúchadh cheart a bheith ann ar Chéim an Choiste agus ar an Tuarascáil.  Molfaidh mé roinnt leasuithe forasacha chun iarracht a dhéanamh reachtaíocht níos foirfe le breis cosaintí a chothú, gan aon rud a bhaint ó bhunphrionsabail an Bhille, dar ndóigh.  Sula ndéanfaidh mé déileáil le sonraí an Bhille, ba mhaith liom roinnt ráitis ghinearálta a dhéanamh maidir le cur chuige an Rialtais i leith coireanna na gangs atá ag déanamh ionsaí ar an bpobal atá an Stát, agus Baill na Tithe seo, ag iarraidh a chosaint.  Creidim go bhfuil an cur chuige sin imithe ar strae.  I roinnt cásanna, tá roinnt easnamh móra ann.I am concerned at the Minister's attempts to sell this Bill, via the media, as some sort of grand solution.  There is a recognition since it was announced that this will not eliminate the need for eye-witness testimony and good old-fashioned Garda investigative work.  We need to ensure that the Garda Síochána has the tools to carry out that work.  We still do not have digital radio fully rolled out to the Garda.  Digital radio, which cannot be intercepted by criminal gangs, is a simple tool which is in virtually every other country in Europe, including some of the poorest countries.  Others have mentioned other tools that are unavailable.There is a need for continuous community policing.  If the Garda Síochána has the support of the community it will also get intelligence from those people because people want to protect themselves and be protected.  We do not want the old-fashioned policing which came to prominence in the Morris tribunal and the Sallins and Dean Lyons cases.  There is no role for that type of policing in Irish society.In most cases witness testimony by members of the public will still be required.  Therefore much more must be done in the area of witness protection.  The repercussions of the recent murder of Roy Collins in Limerick are grave in the extreme.  This murder is believed to have been in retribution for the fact that a member of his family testified successfully against a gangland hood some years back.  Intimidation of the Collins family has continued.  His father, Stephen Collins, was attacked again last week by a gang of nearly 25 criminals.  These horrific crimes raise questions around the inadequacy of protections available to witnesses and their families.Recent events in Dolphin House in my constituency have highlighted the links between State neglect, social exclusion and deprivation, drug dealing and crime.  The failure of the Celtic tiger to visit the complex and of successive Governments to address the problems, social and housing in particular, in this and other working class estates has left them open to the type of activity that occurred in Dolphin House last weekend and early this week.  The organised violence and intimidation aimed at the community and at the Garda Síochána was and is a direct challenge to the rule of law and the Garda.  If that challenge is not met head on the community and its leaders will be left at the mercy of these thugs.  Such violence will also have a knock-on effect, as has been seen in the past, for example, in Limerick where the same situation occurred.  If the Limerick gangs had been tackled head on a number of years ago we would not have had the escalation, the lawlessness and the continuing feuding that has reached a scale never seen before in Limerick or in any part of this State.The State must step in to tackle the gangs in Dolphin House but also must tackle the underlying problems and issues that led to that situation.  Where are the regeneration plans for that estate?  Where are the community games?  The inhabitants have put up with years of neglect and the Celtic tiger never visited their estate.  In this type of community, the people must feel confident that their estate has the backing to be able to stand up to the thugs.  If not, there are people in the community who will not stand idly by and see their community brought into the abyss.  I do not encourage this but the reality is that people will defend themselves.  I have been made aware of this and have tried to discourage people from taking such action.  The community must work with the Garda Síochána and the Garda must work with and for the people.  That means protection.  In the case of Dolphin House, Dublin City Council also has a role to play.  It must deal with the anti-social tenants and the elements who are plying their evil trade in Dublin council estates.  In return, the community will back both Dublin City Council and the Garda Síochána.Witnesses must feel safe and confident that they and their families will be protected.  No expense can be spared to this end.  The legislation before us will not do that job on its own, if at all.  Additional legislation and perhaps additional resources will be required for witness protection.  As it currently operates, the witness protection programme will not do the job.  That has been accepted by the Minister and by the Garda Síochána.  The general consensus of those involved in the former witness protection programme is that it is of limited use in Ireland.  The Garda Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, recently emphasised how difficult it is to ask people to relocate abroad.  The previous Commissioner, Noel Conroy, said that most people are simply too scared.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, James Hamilton, said the programme is of limited use because the demands it places on those entering it are drastic.A full range of protection for witnesses, short of secret relocation, must be explored and resourced.  In the case of the recent Collins murder, if the the individual from the family who gave evidence had been relocated, his family would have remained at risk.  It would have made no difference to the gangs who are willing to go out of their way to target and kill an innocent person, a State witness, and threaten his family.  The challenge to the State is to stand up to those thugs.In many ways, producing new legislation is the easy part.  However, nine times out of ten the response we really need is practical and resource-based rather than legislative.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, claims that tackling crime is his number one priority.  He has even used this as an excuse to annihilate the equality and human rights infrastructure through funding cuts, justifying this by his mission to fight crime.  Laudable though that mission is, the evidence does not stack up.  The Minister is in denial concerning the implications of his own Government's budgetary decisions for operational management and front line policing.All the Garda associations, including the Garda Representative Association, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors and the Association of Garda Superintendents, have pointed out the brain drain and contraction of Garda numbers as consequences of the pension and income levies, the overtime ban and, in particular, the recent illogical recruitment and promotions embargo.  Only last week, the president of the Association of Garda Superintendents clearly stated that early retirement requests are increasing.  Coupled with the public sector recruitment and promotions moratorium, this means that management levels will be difficult to maintain. Ultimately, front line policing will suffer.  The force does not even have the equipment and now there is the threat it will not have the members.  We are in dire straits and there is a need to address that aspect of the recent budgetary decisions.Is léir ón stair go n-ardaíonn coireacht, go háirithe coireacht atá ceangailte le drugaí, in am an mheathlú.  Ní chóir dúinn an tráth eacnamaíochta seo a úsáid mar leathscéal chun cosantaí finnéithe, teaghlaigh agus an phobal i gcoitinne a chur ar leataobh.  Ag casadh ar an mBille, níl aon rogha againn seachas an reachtaíocht seo a ghlacadh.  Tá orainn é a dhéanamh de thoradh an cinneadh a rinneadh sna cúirteanna.This Bill is not optional.  It is mandated by the 1937 Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court.  Privacy is enshrined and is well recognised under Article 40 of the Constitution.  Privacy is more precisely protected by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states:Everyone has a right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except as in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health and morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.The key case detailing the thinking of the European Court of Human Rights in this field, which still prevails, is Klass v. Germany in 1978.  In this case, the Strasbourg court ruled that states do not enjoy an unlimited discretion to subject persons within their jurisdiction to secret surveillance.The court, being aware of the dangers such a law poses of undermining or even destroying democracy on the ground of defending it, affirms that the contracting states may not, in the name of the struggle against espionage or terrorism, adopt whatever measure they deem appropriate.It further ruled that the court must be satisfied that whatever system of surveillance is adopted, there exists an adequate and effective guarantee against abuse.  Obviously, that is what we are trying to address in the Bill.  As Paul Anthony McDermott stated at the annual national prosecutors conference in Dublin Castle last summer:The constant emphasis the Strasbourg court placed on the detailed provisions and criteria laid out in the German law makes it all the clearer that it is necessary for Ireland to set out its police powers in relation to covert surveillance and undercover detection in an accessible statutory framework subject to checks and balances and tailored to the need to protect the interests of democratic states.  Any blank cheque written for the Irish legislature for An Garda Síochána in this area will not be honoured in Strasbourg.The absence of such a statutory framework and the type of abuse to which its absence gives rise was highlighted by the Morris tribunal when it investigated Garda corruption in County Donegal.  The third volume of the tribunal's report published in 2008 investigated allegations of covert surveillance and taping and I shall put some of the conclusions of that report on the record.The tribunal pointed out that apart from the unusual Kane v. The Governor of Mountjoy Prison case, the Garda Síochána have been left without statutory guidance and the citizen without adequate understanding of the extent to which overt or covert surveillance may be carried out on an individual.  The tribunal stated that it was disturbed and dismayed at the extent to which covert taping was conducted by gardaí not only of conversations with civilians, but of conversations between gardaí supposedly working together.  It noted that it was entirely wrong that gardaí should be recording persons, including their colleagues and senior officers, at will or contemplating or carrying out covert surveillance using electronic devices without any statutory guidance or regulation and without internal guidelines.Mr. Justice Morris concluded that the Legislature had a job to do.  We are thankful the Minister has started the work by presenting us with this Bill.  Obviously, the Garda also has a job of work to do and recent progress has been made in setting down guidelines so that never again will we have the type of corruption and skulduggery that Mr. Justice Morris investigated within the Donegal division.On the interesting issue of surveillance, wire tapping and so on, I asked a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to guarantee that no Member of this House was under electronic or other surveillance.  The answer I received from him was to the effect that two Members of the House were under surveillance.  I do not know who they are, perhaps one might be a Fianna Fáil backbencher who was up to no good.  However, can the present Minister give a guarantee at this stage that there is no surveillance of Members of this House?  I do not believe wire tapping is done anymore, it is more a case of electronic taps.The culture of secrecy and the special branch agenda, which predominated in this State for the last 30 years, is said to be at an end.  However, I do not believe it is because in my constituency at Easter, members of the special branch were still monitoring Sinn Féin Easter Week commemorations.  There is still a level of harassment of Sinn Féin members and I had thought that at this stage the special branch would have copped on, or at least the Garda Commissioner.  I intend to raise this issue with him, directly.Another aspect is that it is not just a question of surveillance by An Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces that needs to be looked at because although I am not a conspiracy theorist, I believe external espionage groups such as MI6, the CIA or even Mossad are operating in Ireland.  It is strange that we have never seen, as in other countries, an exposure of the activities of foreign security services.  Very little action appears to be taken in this regard and they seem to be allowed to work at will.  Perhaps we can address this at another stage, namely, the dirty murky world of political and economic espionage, which is aimed against this State and the people living in it.  Perhaps greater sentencing might be considered for those involved in such activities.I want to highlight a number of areas where, without interfering with the purpose of the Bill or compromising its objectives, it can be improved.  I am disappointed that the positive safeguards, principally judicial involvement in the authorisation process, are not being extended to a broader range of surveillance techniques. A host of surveillance and covert policing techniques with inherent privacy implications are still to remain without lawful basis.  I believe the European Convention on Human Rights is wide open to legal challenge, even where the use of such techniques might be justified and allowable, were it to be underpinned by legislation.  In addition, the many great shortcomings of the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993 and the data protection provisions contained in the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 still remain unaddressed.  Also the principle of judicial authorisation as a norm is to be welcomed, but we need to tighten up in that area.Constitutional practices in the United States contrast massively and favourably against the approach taken by Britain, which is what we are emulating, although I accept the need for the Bill to contain provisions for emergency authorisation in the absence of a judge being available.  However, I believe certain amendments should be made in section 7 which deals with this eventuality.  In urgent cases, section 7 allows a superintendent to authorise surveillance for a period of 72 hours.  This needs to be tightened up.  The onus should be on the superintendent to make an ongoing effort to obtain judicial authorisation and to document this effort.  In addition, from my reading of the Bill, there is nothing to stop the Garda authorising 72-hour surveillance, breaking for 24 hours and then replicating such authorisation again and again — in effect, putting in place long-term surveillance without judicial authorisation.There are a number of other issues I intend to address on Committee Stage.  This legislation is required and that it will be useful in the ongoing fight against the criminal gangs in particular, which have become more and more adept at avoiding prosecution and are becoming more and more sophisticated.  They seem to have all the resources they need and if the Garda Síochána is to tackle them it will need not just the legislation but the resources required by a modern police force.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I take great pleasure in making a small contribution to this debate.  I support the concept covered by the Bill because like other Members of the House I have tried over a number of years to focus on the growing levels of crime and the degree to which the public is being intimidated by the increased sophistication among criminal elements.I am not certain whether this legislation should stand alone or be part of a more consolidated initiative to attack the criminals as they have been attacking society over several years.  I am a greater believe in and supporter of people's civil liberties, which must always be observed, whether they are victims or criminals.  However, balance must enter into the whole arena and should come firmly down on the side of the citizen.  We have seen the development of criminal activity to such an extent in this country that the State has become a laughing stock.The State is vulnerable and is itself a victim because its citizens are under intimidation and being threatened on a regular basis.  Previous speakers have made reference to the intimidation of witnesses.  That has been an enormous factor in terms of what has gone on in this country over a number of years.  We have no evidence that jurors were intimidated but one can be certain that they would have been, as well as the witnesses, should this have been seen as fortuitous in the worldview of the criminals.A pattern has been established in Ireland regarding crime levels, whereby young successful criminals start their activities by intimidating their next-door neighbours, kicking in their front doors, preying on senior citizens in the immediate area, "keying" parked cars, breaking windows and generally making a nuisance of themselves.  Despite all the efforts of gardaí, public representatives and everybody else, they seem to go unchallenged because it is not worth the time, effort and energy needed to bring them through the system.  In most cases it is not even possible to bring them through the system and in any event there is no place to put them.  However, if we have not had a place to put them it is about time we got one.  They should be given a clear indication by the courts and the institutions of this State that there is no time or place for them in this society.  We have had enough and the time has come to take action.The provisions in the Bill form only a part of what is required at the present time.  I do not accept the view that we should stand by indefinitely while making varying attempts to address the issue.  We have done that for the last ten or 15 years and it has not worked.  How often do we hear of crimes, murders, intimidation carried out by people who have been described as "known to the Garda".  That does not mean that there had been ongoing dialogue or the passing of correspondence between them and the Garda.  It means that they had come under suspicion for some considerable time and that their activities had been noted.  This legislation may be of assistance in grounding such activity and giving the Garda the necessary information that is required.However, members of the public has become cynical in this regard, especially when they read, perhaps six months or a year after someone has carried out an obnoxious crime against some individual, that he or she was known to the Garda.  The time has come when it does not matter whether such individuals were known to the Garda.  If they have embarked on activities that constitute a threat to the citizens or institutions of this State then it is time to deal with them.  I have come to the conclusion after much consideration, as have many other Members of this House, that the time has come to take them off the streets completely.  We should then look at the degree to which they have organised themselves and the degree to which they, or their associates, have carried out criminal activity, including murder.  I cannot understand why that is not possible.  It was done under the Offences Against the State Act, and I know people might suggest there were some excesses there.The problem we now face is much more serious than any we have faced in the history of this State.  I do not know if people know or fully recognise that.  The one thing which is certain is that as long as criminals know they can act with impunity, they will continue their criminal activities as long as they are remunerative, and criminal activities are very remunerative.  We often read about how they holiday only in the best places and how they are exiles.  We talk about tax exiles but we have criminal exiles as well who live the high life which is much emulated by other young up and coming criminals.  The up and coming criminals start off with petty crime but they build up a reputation and become serious heavy-hitters in every sense of the word after a while.  Anybody who gets in their way is vulnerable and under threat of intimation and extortion.  In such a situation, the criminal with the most power rules the land.I have great sympathy for gardaí in divisions in which serious heavy-hitters operate on a daily basis.  The answer to this problem is to introduce consolidation legislation, put in place all the necessary backup, take these people off the streets once and for all and refuse to allow the people to be intimated on a regular basis by thugs who should be behind bars from the start.We should start with the most high profile people at the very top, the people with the most romantic and lucrative lifestyles.  We believe zero tolerance worked in the United States of America but it did not.  In the United States of America, they started at the top and worked their way down.  Eventually they got to the guys at the bottom of the crime ladder and were able to deal with them.  Former Mayor Koch in New York started at the top and put the really heavy-hitters behind bars where they belonged.I refer to the civil liberties and civil rights of the people carrying out this criminal activity.  Everybody would agree that they have rights.  The Minister who comes from the legal profession would take me to task on that very quickly.  I am not a lawyer but I have read bits of the law from time to time.  What amazes me is how the criminal elements have managed to circumvent the law and are now legal experts.  They quote the law.  They study it in prison and they operate from there.How can some of these people organise their criminal empires from within prisons?  I visited a prisoner recently and if I was the number one hitman from Chicago in the 1930s, I would not have been subjected to a better assessment and examination.  I have no problem with that.  It is as it should be.  How in God's name have people managed to smuggle in their mobile telephones and all the trappings that go with them and have regular visits from their organisers, their hitmen and hitwomen and so on?  We must deal with all those ancillary activities which are part and parcel of what is a growing crime problem.I agree with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, that, unfortunately, the problem now is that many people, with the exception of a few crime journalists, have become complacent.  They look at crime statistics and state that the level of crime in this country is not huge in comparison to other countries.  I do not care about the comparison to other countries.  We will look after our own country and we should deal with those who intimidate the public in whatever way is necessary to put them behind bars as quickly as possible.  We should do that by using the law and putting in place sufficient legislation to ensure that anybody involved in, or known to be involved in, crime is not on the street plotting and planning his or her next crime.The bail laws are flouted on a regular basis.  People charged with serious crimes are released on bail to commit more serious crimes, to intimidate more witnesses and to ensure that they can never be put behind bars.  I cannot understand that.  The law is being brought into disrepute and is being treated with contempt, as are the law-abiding citizens of this State who are also being intimidated on a regular basis.  The Minister and the institutions of the State are being treated likewise.The time has long since passed for playing around with these guys who are well organised thugs.  All they have to do is to organise a hit on somebody and he or she is dead.  I have been told that it only costs €500.I mentioned the intimidation of witnesses.  Some members of the Judiciary have been very courageous in standing up to this kind of thing and some action is being taken.  However, the Minister knows this is only skimming the surface of the problem.If one needs proof of the seriousness of the situation, one should recount the number of occasions when people coming out of the courts have given the two fingers to photographers, news reporters, television cameramen, etc.  That is how much respect they have for the law and the institutions of the State.  What should be done in a case such as that is quite simple.  The person should be brought back into the court and given an extra sentence.  That would teach him or her a lesson.  Unless that happens, such actions will continue.  I do not know how the Minister finds it but I find it very offensive that some thug is able to have his or her photograph taken and put on the front page of a newspaper giving two fingers of contempt for the public.  That is appalling as is the fact that our society has degenerated to that level.  That we give rights to such people is a sad reflection on our society.The time has come to ensure that the rights of the law-abiding citizen are not eroded by overly accommodating the rights of the criminals.  The Minister has responsibility to deal with them in a serious and comprehensive way.  This Bill is one element of that proposal.  There is a need for emergency legislation to round up these individuals and to detain them indefinitely.  When they come out of prison, perhaps the public will have forgotten they existed in the first place.  That will have to happen and somebody will have to do that sooner or later.There is always a catalyst.  We have seen several catalysts in recent times where innocent people have been gunned down in drive-by shootings, in some cases committed by people out on bail having been charged with serious crimes, including murder.  Some people charged with murder have been released on bail and have carried out another one.  Why do they not carry out a dozen of them while they are at it?  They are free and cannot go wrong.Where are we heading and how do we handle this?  This Bill will not achieve everything but it will be part of the procedures which need to be put in place to at least tip the scales in favour of the law-abiding citizens.Our society has become complacent.  It is sad that each criminal act blots out of our recollection that one that preceded it.  In the nature of things, each new event tends to push into the background those that came before it.  I would have thought that the appalling murder of Veronica Guerin was a classic example of an event that brought our society to its senses.  At that time, I had serious concerns about giving extra power to the authorities in case those powers might be abused.  There is always a tendency to cut corners, if the situation demands it.  The legislation establishing the Criminal Assets Bureau was initially very successful.  I was pleasantly surprised when it achieved a great deal.  I am not sure that it is achieving as much now as it did at the outset.  I suggest that criminal elements in our society have wised up.  They are able to combat much, if not all, of the work of the bureau.  They are wiser than they were.  They are beginning to compete with the Criminal Assets Bureau.  We need to examine the matter again.Some day, Deputies will come to this House once more to debate another horrendous crime that will seize the imagination of the people.  It will be too late at that stage.  We will have examined this issue and listened to various opinions on it, but we will have let it pass us by.  We will have let the water run over us.  We will have failed to confront the issue that has presented itself to us.  The time for taking action in this area has come and gone.  If we do not wake up to the threat that faces society at present, we will be negligent.  The time has come for the Minister to take action.  I am not criticising him personally.  Everybody knows about this problem, which is a fact of life.I would like to speak about the increased frequency of so-called "tiger" kidnappings.  This insidious type of crime has been very successful for some criminals.  In some cases, very little of the proceeds of such crimes has been recovered.  While some retribution has been achieved, it has been limited.  The lending institutions need to tighten up their security systems if they are to make it impossible for people to infiltrate them under any circumstances.  One should not argue that it is impossible to prevent people from disabling alarm systems, for example, because it is possible.  Having read about the operation of these security systems, I cannot understand how they can be disabled to the extent that has been done.Many members of the Judiciary have been courageous in their attempts to frustrate organised crime.  They have done that against the background of the possibility of convictions being appealed.  However, they should not try to anticipate the outcome of any appeal.  They should do their best in each case, given the circumstances and the evidence before them.  It is entirely a matter for the next phase of the legal system — the Court of Criminal Appeal, for example — to take responsibility for determining whether the load that has been imposed on a criminal should be overturned or lightened.  That is the important part of it.  Judges should not anticipate what the higher court might decide, even if it is possible for them to do that on the basis of their understanding of case law.  As crime gets worse and more serious and the threat to society increases, the need for us to react becomes more urgent, short and simple.Like everybody else in this House, I could speak at great length about this issue.  I compliment those crime reporters who continually try to bring the serious problem that is faced by society to the attention of the general public, the Members of this House and the Minister.  I will not name any of them, because it would not be fair.  Long may they continue, and be allowed to continue, to do their work.  We should never allow the rights and entitlements of the law-abiding citizens of this country to be eroded by those who engage in crime, including organised crime, and those who benefit in any way from the proceeds of crime.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I thank Deputies for declaring their general support for this Bill and thank the House for taking the legislation relatively quickly.  I am pleased that it has received a broad welcome from all sides of the House.  I believe the Bill represents a proportionate and balanced response to this problem.  It will enable us to give the Garda the tools to engage in electronic surveillance.  If this legislation is accepted, it will be possible to ensure that its measures are not used in a way with which most ordinary citizens would be unhappy.  That is why certain checks and balances are included in the Bill.I would like to refer to a number of specific issues that were raised by Members this morning.  Deputy Costello expressed his reservations about the section of the Bill that will provide for a 72-hour period of surveillance in urgent cases.  He was referring to circumstances in which judicial authorisation will not initially be needed for surveillance of 72 hours.  A Bill that was previously proposed by the Labour Party provided for a seven-day period, which would have been much longer than the three-day period set out in the legislation before the House.  In 1998, the Law Reform Commission recommended that in urgent cases, surveillance of 14 days should be allowed without authorisation.  We have reduced the relevant period from 14 days, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, to 72 hours in urgent cases.  That is an illustration of the attempt we have made to draw up the provisions of this Bill in a proportionate manner.I fully agree with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's argument that we should not restrain the type of surveillance that forms part of ordinary policing.  That is why this Bill includes definitions of "surveillance" and "surveillance device" that are designed not to bring ordinary surveillance activities within the scope of this legislation.  If no device under the ambit of this Bill is used during surveillance, the surveillance in question is not covered by the Bill.  Interestingly, Deputy Ó Snodaigh expressed a view that was diametrically opposed to that of Deputy O'Keeffe.  As I understand it, he called on the remit of the Bill to be extended so all surveillance — electronic or otherwise — will have to be authorised in line with the terms of this legislation.  That would mean that a garda who wanted to follow a suspect down the street would have to get a judicial authorisation for that action, which would be ludicrous.  Perhaps I am incorrect, as I did not hear all of Deputy Ó Snodaigh's submission.  If my interpretation of his remarks is accurate, they are interesting.  I can inform Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who asked about the forthcoming criminal justice (forensic sampling and evidence) Bill, that we hope to publish the Bill before the end of this session.I would like to respond to the repeated criticism of my rejection of a previous Fine Gael Private Members' Bill, which attempted to deal with the issue of evidence that is obtained illegally and unconstitutionally.  The Bill sought to abolish the exclusionary rule that governs the admissibility of evidence, following on from the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the cases of Shaw and Kenny.  The review group on the balance in the criminal law, which published its report in March 2007, warned against the dangers of adopting what it called a "full-frontal approach" to statutory intervention in the case of the exclusionary rule.  Such an approach was advocated in the legislation proposed by Fine Gael, however.  People are missing the point of the objectives of section 14 of this legislation.  The press statement on this issue that was produced by Fine Gael's justice spokesperson yesterday was totally incorrect.  The proposals to which I refer are quite different from those contained in the Private Members' Bill that was proposed by Fine Gael.  Section 14 does not propose the abolition of the exclusionary rule, in any shape or form.  Equally, it does not seek to address any unlawful conduct of any officer relating to a matter in which surveillance is carried out.  We are providing for a narrow exception that relates solely to the procedures set out in this Bill.  It is designed to address a specific difficulty.  What we propose is not dissimilar to section 27(4) of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 dealing with tape recordings of suspects and the relevant 1987 regulations made thereunder.  It is not the same issue and I ask Fine Gael to desist from trying to suggest that it is.Deputy Rabbitte referred to his party's Private Member's Bill on this subject, published in 2007.  We had significant reservations about that Bill because it did not contain specific safeguards for privacy.  The Labour Party Bill was based on the Law Reform Commission's proposals of nearly a decade previously but there has been a great deal of case law in the intervening period in the European Court of Human Rights on this issue.  It is all very well to eulogise the Labour Party Bill but it was based on proposals dating back as far as 1998 and could not be accepted now, particularly in respect of safeguards.Deputy Noonan had reservations about the inclusion of reserve members of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in the definition of "relevant person" in section 13.  They are excluded from surveillance and surveillance activities but the provision for confidentiality under section 13 covers them in case, in their work as reserves, they accidentally come across any information about these processes.  There is no hidden agenda.Section 5(4) refers to the only form of privilege understood in law, legal professional privilege.  It does not extend to concepts of journalistic privilege or communications between spouses.Deputy Charles Flanagan spoke at length about some aspects of Garda resources, such as Operation Anvil, bail and witness protection.  I do not want to re-hash all that has been said but I have said that I have dedicated increased resources to Operation Anvil and the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, despite a contracting Exchequer position.  Other areas in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform Vote had to suffer but I make no apologies for that because I indicated when I took up office in the Department that I wished to concentrate on the number one priority which was crime.Several Deputies asked about the other measures that I and the Government are considering.  We are in intense discussions with the Attorney General in respect of each of these issues.  In light of ongoing intimidation of witnesses and jurors the State must act.  Significant evidence on this has come forward.  Some Members have told me that they can give clear instances of intimidation which might not be available to the Garda Síochána, which I would welcome.We propose that the powers available under existing legislation to combat subversive organisations be applied to criminal gangs as much as possible.  One element of this is the decision to schedule the criminal organisation offences which would in effect require a declaration that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure effective administration of justice and preserve public peace and order.  This is a significant step and should not be taken lightly.  In view of what has happened recently we must indicate clearly that the Oireachtas will act.I am examining several issues.  This is not an exhaustive list and is subject to final vetting and approval by the Attorney General.  It includes the offence of participation under the 2006 Act.  I think it is section 72.  The language in that section makes it extremely difficult to prove participation in a criminal organisation.  We are considering that to see whether we can make it easier to ground a prosecution.  It is also proposed to create a new offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation and we aim to put in a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for that.  I have had intense discussions on membership with my officials and the Attorney General.  We propose a new offence of involvement in criminal activity in association with a criminal organisation with a maximum penalty of 15 years.  The third measure we are considering is a proposal to make that offence, the new proposed offence of directing a criminal organisation, and the existing organised crime offences, schedule offences for the purposes of the Offences Against the State Act, to be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  I am also proposing that all those criminal organisation offences would be schedule offences under the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  This would have the effect of applying sections 25 and 26 of that Act to those offences.  Section 25 provides for higher sentences for repeat offences and section 26 provides for post-release supervision similar to that used for sex offenders.  If somebody was convicted of one of these serious criminal organisation offences he or she might be charged again if he or she broke the supervision orders made at the sentencing, for example, by associating with known former members of criminal gangs.  A fifth proposal is to schedule these criminal gang offences as serious offences within the meaning of the Bail Act 1967, thereby providing for circumstances where the courts may refuse bail.Members on both sides of the House have expressed their views on opinion evidence which has been fraught with some legal difficulty.  The previous Attorney General gave very strong advice during the drafting of the 2006 and 2007 legislation about the difficulty it poses in court without substantial corroborative evidence.  After the Shane Geoghegan murder I asked the Attorney General to again review this issue because Members on both sides, particularly Deputy Noonan, raised it.  We received similar advice but are considering the possibility of allowing a court to take into account, among other things, expert evidence from a senior member of the Garda Síochána as to the existence of a criminal organisation in determining whether the accused was directing, or participated in, a criminal organisation.  That goes some way to address the issue of opinion evidence.  I must emphasise however that we need corroborative evidence all the time to back this up but the courts have said that they will not convict somebody on the opinion of one person.  The surveillance legislation when passed will be an extremely important tool in the panoply of measures available to the gardaí to produce corroborative evidence.We are also considering that in respect of all organised crime offences the courts would be able to draw inferences from the failure to answer questions, or to account for movements, actions, activities or associations.  To some extent, these provisions are already contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2007, but we need to extend them to the new offences we are proposing.The eighth issue we are looking at concerns the simplification of the process regarding the extension of time for questioning.  There has been some suggestion that we would extend the period of seven days, which is the ultimate period.  I am not in favour of that personally.  However, together with my officials and in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, I have examined the issue of how we can simplify the procedures in order to reduce the amount of Garda resources which are directed during a very important time of investigation.  I have to accept that ultimately we are talking about people's liberty and it is important to ensure that if people are being detained for a further period, the proper proofs must be entered into as to why that is necessary.  Obviously it is subject to judicial decision, but at the same time we must also be conscious that gardaí during that period are involved in a very intensive investigation.  Therefore, we are looking at simplifying the procedure and also ensuring that the hearings themselves concerning the extension of time cannot be used to obtain information or to put information into a relatively public domain that might in fact prejudice the Garda investigation.Given the fact that we are worried about the intimidation of witnesses and jurors, a ninth issue we are looking at is the possibility of increasing the present maximum sentence of ten years to 15.  A tenth issue concerns the penalty for the existing participation offence, which we are examining with a view to increasing the penalty from five to 15 years.  I think it is in section 72 of the 2006 Act.Deputy Rabbitte and others asked me to indicate what issues we are examining.  We are looking at a number of issues intensely in the context of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Substantial work has already been carried out on that legislation.  I hope to bring proposals to Government within the next couple of weeks following which I will ask the Oireachtas to examine the legislation at an early opportunity.I am amenable to some of the suggestions that Deputy Charles Flanagan has made, including his party's proposals on sentencing.  I am examining that matter.Coming back to the Bill before us, it is proportionate, balanced and subject to authorisation in all but urgent cases.  All authorisation cases, whether judicial or non-judicial, are subject to oversight by a High Court judge.  When available, the report on overall surveillance activity is sent to the Taoiseach as well as being laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.

I also have another Bill, the criminal procedure Bill, which arises as a result of my initiative on victims.  That Bill is in its final throes and will loosen up the rule against double jeopardy as well as dealing with various matters, including victim impact statements.  The data retention Bill is close to publication, and will be published within the next week or so.  In addition, the criminal justice (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is all but ready.  Therefore, there are a significant number of Bills and I will seek the forbearance of Opposition justice spokespersons to allow these measures to pass through the House.  I accept that getting such legislation through Committee Stage poses a difficulty, but we will do our level best.We wish to have the Bill before us passed as soon as possible, as well as the criminal justice (amendment) Bill to which I referred.  I suggest that these measures are the priorities, and thereafter perhaps the criminal procedure Bill.I thank Members of the House for accepting this Bill.  I am not saying it is the panacea for all ills in the country, of course it is not.  We cannot deal with the problems by legislation alone; it must also be done by ordinary policing.  I have heard suggestions that some gardaí may be taken away from Limerick, but that is not the case.  I have clarified that matter with the Garda Síochána.  The full resources of the Garda Síochána will be concentrated on those areas where they are needed most, particularly the city of Limerick.  That is not to say, however, that I am being in any way complacent as regards the rest of the country.  Given the fact that the number of gardaí is at an all time high, and will remain so for some considerable time, despite any moratorium on recruitment, they have the resources to fight what is an insidious element.  It is an element which, in my view, is similar to the paramilitary activity that brought this country to its knees.  The Oireachtas must react when we clearly see instances where people are taking on the State's criminal justice system.  They are also taking on ordinary decent people who would be more than willing to come forward and give evidence, yet because of the type of intimidation that has gone on, they are not coming forward.I thank Members for their contributions to this debate and hopefully the Bill will have a speedy passage through the House.

For the first time in legislation, the Bill defines what we mean by housing services.  It provides a more strategic approach to delivery and management of those services through service plans and action programmes, whatever the prevailing economic conditions.  It presents a more objective and comprehensive basis for assessing need and allocating housing.  It provides a more effective management and control regime covering rents and tenancy arrangements, and a more developed statutory basis for the rental accommodation scheme.  It is innovative with the introduction of the incremental purchase scheme aimed at helping those seeking social housing support to become homeowners.Overall, the Bill supports the creation of a flexible and graduated system of housing supports for those in need of housing.  It sets out a framework to allow for the delivery of these services in a way that meets individual needs, but respects the concept of developing sustainable communities.  In addition, it provides for a system where individuals and households are dealt with fairly and consistently across the country.The contributions by Deputies dealt with a wide range of issues reflecting, in many ways, the complex character of housing.  I will endeavour to deal with as many of these matters as time permits.It is clear that Deputies from all sides of the House are concerned with the issue of homelessness.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, it is also a key concern of mine.  That is why I launched the strategy The Way Home in August 2008 and more recently the national implementation plan for the strategy.  The Way Home sets out a clear vision of a future where the occurrence of homelessness is minimised.  Where homelessness does arise, our aim is that nobody will sleep rough or remain in emergency accommodation for more than six months.  These are important and challenging objectives but substantial legislative change is not required to implement this vision.Housing authorities already have the power to provide emergency services for homeless people by virtue of the Housing Act 1988 and this is one of a range of housing supports listed in section 10.  More permanent solutions to the accommodation needs of homeless people are encompassed in the various forms of social housing support described in section 19.  It is, therefore, simply untrue to suggest, as some Deputies have done, that the issue of homelessness is not dealt with in the Bill.The issue of a new definition of homelessness was also raised.  The Government has decided in the context of its strategy, The Way Home, that the statutory definition will not be changed.  We will, however, review how the definition is applied operationally to ensure, for example, consistency in its application across local authorities.  This has been made clear in the homeless strategy and implementation plan and also in the course of engagement with representatives of service providers in the MakeRoom alliance.A number of Deputies raised the issue of the provision of a statutory basis for homeless action plans.  This is an important matter which was also discussed in some detail during the Bill's passage through the Seanad.  As I have indicated previously, The Way Home document was launched after the publication of the Bill and certain aspects, including those with statutory implications, were not sufficiently advanced to be comprehended by this Bill.  My Department, in conjunction with Parliamentary Counsel, is working on bringing forward the necessary legislative provisions and I hope to bring these provisions before the House on Committee Stage.A number of Deputies raised the issue of the tenant purchase of apartments.  As the House is aware — Deputies made this point in their contributions — the drafting of workable proposals for the sale of local authority apartments is difficult.  Our focus has been on establishing a sufficiently robust framework to allow sales to proceed, given that past endeavours had to be abandoned.  While I am determined to make progress on this issue as quickly as possible, we must get it right.  Our aim is to establish a robust legislative framework that will stand the test of time for all stakeholders, namely, apartment buyers, apartment tenants who choose not to buy and local authorities.Deputies Bannon and Durkan referred to the issue of the sale of voluntary and co-operative houses under a tenant purchase scheme.  As the Deputies are aware, there is no provision at present for the purchase of individual houses by tenants of approved housing bodies.  The housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, indicated that consideration would be given, in consultation with the voluntary and co-operative sector, to piloting a tenant purchase scheme for some new voluntary homes based on the incremental purchase model.  The issues arising therefrom are being considered in consultation with the Irish Council for Social Housing.  Part 3 provides for the sale by an approved body of a proportion of newly constructed dwellings under incremental purchase.I share the concerns expressed by all Deputies that local authorities should have mechanisms available to them to deal with anti-social behaviour in their estates.  Such behaviour can threaten the sustainability of communities and further disadvantage vulnerable households.  The provisions of the Bill go some way towards improving the existing regime by updating the definition of anti-social behaviour and introducing anti-social behaviour strategies in section 35.  In conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, I am examining the scope for further changes to existing legislation that will enhance the role of housing authorities in addressing anti-social behaviour.  I will incorporate any further measures in this area during the Bill's passage through the Oireachtas.Deputy Flanagan raised issues concerning the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the leasing options from the perspective of both value for money and meeting social housing needs.  The policy which underpins this Bill is clearly aimed at providing a framework to achieve best value for money and best outcome for those in need of housing.  This takes account of a central tenet of the NESC report that we should have a flexible and graduated response to need.  The rental accommodation scheme forms part of this flexible response, providing choice to those seeking housing and allowing housing authorities to utilise a range of options to meet need.An additional option is also available to local authorities following my decision to divert some resources that would otherwise have been used to build and buy new social housing units to support a programme of acquiring dwellings for social housing purposes on long-term leases.  An initial €20 million for this purpose has been earmarked in 2009, allowing local authorities an opportunity to take some 2,000 properties on long-term leases.  This initiative will allow for a significantly greater level of need to be met in the short term.  In addition, while not a basis for the proposal, its implementation will generate a degree of momentum in terms of bringing vacant properties into use and may have some positive influence on sentiment in the housing market.Deputies Terence Flanagan, Ciarán Lynch and Catherine Byrne referred to the inspection regime in the private rented sector.  Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed by way of regulations made under section 18 of the Housing Act 1992.  I signed new regulations on 10 December 2008 which came into effect on 1 February last, with certain elements coming into effect for existing rental properties four years hence.  All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations and responsibility for enforcement rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Private Residential Tenancies Board.Further improvements to the regime are being addressed in the context of the Bill.  An important amendment was made on Committee Stage in the Seanad to include measures to make available to local authorities a new, comprehensive sanctions regime.  It will involve the issuing of improvement notices to landlords where rental properties are found to be in breach of the regulations and, where a landlord does not comply with an improvement notice, local authorities may issue prohibition notices which will prevent the further renting of a property until it complies with the standards.  Fines for offences related to the standards regulations will also be increased.In general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity in recent years.  Inspection numbers have more than doubled from 6,815 to 17,138 in the period from 2005 to 2008.  I am committed to building on the significant progress made in recent years with regard to inspection of private rented accommodation.A number of Deputies raised the issue of property management companies.  As Deputies are aware, apartment complexes are a relatively recent development in the Irish market and the policy and practice of managing such developments has had to play catch up to a certain extent.  Since the publication of the Law Reform Commission's report on multi-unit developments in June 2008, work on the preparation of legislative and administrative proposals to respond to its recommendations has continued across relevant Departments.  The Government recently approved the drafting of the general scheme of a multi-unit developments Bill and decided that, apart from a number of discrete provisions relating to regulatory and planning issues, matters relating to multi-unit developments would be dealt with in a single Bill.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the lead role in progressing this Bill, with input from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department, as required.A number of Deputies opposite referred to what they termed a lack of progress on housing during the boom years.  This is simply not true.  Investment over the past ten years in social and affordable housing has been significant and considerable progress has been made.  Some €17 billion has been spent across all social and affordable housing programmes, meeting the needs of almost 142,000 households.  Of the €17 billion figure, almost €9 billion has been spent on the main housing construction programme, which met the needs of almost 53,000 household over the past decade.  Total expenditure last year on social and affordable housing programmes came to some €2.4 billion compared to €500 million in 1998.Notwithstanding this progress, the 2008 housing needs assessment showed an increase of some 30% in net housing need since 2005.  In deploying the available resources for housing in 2009, priority will attach to meeting the needs of these and other vulnerable groups.  In that regard, the Exchequer provision for 2009 of more than €1.4 billion demonstrates a significant level of investment to support activity under the range of housing programmes this year, albeit within a severely constrained financial environment.Given the difficult fiscal and economic climate in which we find ourselves and the significant transition that the housing sector is going through, we must also ensure that we invest the housing provision for 2009 with flexibility and creativity in order that we can continue to respond effectively to the diverse housing needs that exist.This Bill provides additional legislative support to the efforts being made by the Government, local authorities, the voluntary and co-operative housing sector and other actors in the housing area.  I am confident it will radically improve the capacity of housing authorities to plan and deliver their services in a coherent, flexible and responsive manner.  I am greatly encouraged by the supportive and constructive contributions of Members during Second Stage and look forward to dealing with the detail of the Bill in committee.

This is not the Health Bill we should have before us in the Dáil today.  On 1 April the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney announced the establishment of an expert group on resource allocation and financing the health sector.  It is not due to report until April 2010.  I have no doubt the deliberations of the new group will be used to further delay the publication of the Eligibility for Health and Personal Social Services Bill, which has been promised for years.  Why the delay?  The answer is obvious.  The last thing the Government wants  to discuss is the question of rights and entitlements to health services. It has presided over and reinforced a system where wealth can buy better health care and the private for-profit health business is allowed to act as a parasite on the public health system.As the public health system reels under the cuts imposed since 2007 and braces itself for even worse to come, the Minister, Deputy Harney ploughs on with the building of private for-profit hospitals on public hospitals sites, subsidised by the hard-pressed taxpayer.  The Minister, Deputy Harney and the Government imposed a so-called public service pension levy on nurses and have sanctioned the non-renewal of contracts for up to 14,000 workers in the public health service.  At the same time the Minister, Deputy Harney gave a gold-plated guarantee to the hospital consultants that their €250,000 per annum contract will not be touched.  This is for a 33-hour week in the public system, and they can still work up to 25% of the time in private practice.  Even at that, the hours are not properly monitored, providing another lucrative let-off for whatever number — it is not everyone — is happy to abuse their privileged position.This is what the Minister, Deputy Harney and the Department of Health and Children preside over in crumbling Hawkins House which, a view not unique to me, is the ugliest building in this city.  At times it has struck me as a very appropriate symbol of this Government's health policy.What is the role of the Legislature in all of this?  We are excluded from any role, except for the rubber-stamp type of legislation we have before us today, the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009.  The Minister, Deputy Harney has made herself unaccountable through the establishment of the HSE, while major policy decisions with major implications for the health service are not put before the Oireachtas.  For example, the Government never put one sentence of substantive legislation before us regarding its co-location proposals.This Bill gives more functions to the HSE and the Department, something I would be reluctant to do.  Earlier this month in my constituency, two prominent general practitioners resigned from the HSE GP unit, citing in an open letter to Professor Brendan Drumm the arrogance of HSE management and its complete disregard for the views of general practitioners.  In February this year, 41 GPs in Cavan and Monaghan signed another open letter opposing, on patient safety grounds, the removal of acute medical services from Monaghan General Hospital.We have no choice but to address this Bill within its limited scope and to accept in good faith the assurances we have been given that the functions of the various bodies now to be subsumed into the Department and the HSE will be properly fulfilled.  However, we must also be assured, and this is the assurance I am seeking today, that the work will be properly monitored and that the Minister, Deputy Harney, and the HSE will be fully accountable for these functions.The Bill dissolves the National Council on Ageing and Older People and transfers its employees, assets and liabilities to the Department of Health and Children.  It establishes the office for older people to support the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with special responsibility for older people, Deputy Barry Andrews  The programme for Government has a commitment to frame and publish a national positive ageing strategy and the Department has informed me that this will now be its function.A cross-departmental group has been set up to prepare the strategy and the former Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, has said it is intended to facilitate the participation of older people in the process of preparing the it.  These include an invitation to make written submissions and the conduct of consultation meetings around the country.  I urge that this work proceed without delay.  I also urge that the Government reverse its recent decision and proceed with the publication of the national carers' strategy, a matter of vital concern to older people.  The production and implementation of these strategies will be the real test as to whether the office of older people will work.With regard to the dissolution of the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Women's Health Council, the National Cancer Screening Service Board, the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, concern has been expressed about whether their functions will be safeguarded within the Department and the HSE.  I wish to refer here to the relevant questions posed by the National Women's Council of Ireland and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews to respond in detail.  As the Bill does not provide for any review mechanism to monitor or measure this change of policy direction against outcomes how will Government and the Oireachtas know if the functions of the agencies are being carried out by the Department of Health and Children?  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Andrews, to note the specific question, as well as a number of others I wish to pose, and to ensure they will be responded to fully in his closing contribution to this Second Stage debate.  What is the estimated cost of dissolving these bodies and what are the projected savings, which we are told there will be?  What is being done to safeguard the knowledge or institutional memory built up by these agencies since their inception?  The staff in question have much knowledge and experience which should not be lost to the public service.  What commitments have been made to ensure that the Department and the HSE will continue to work in partnership with civil society and other relevant sectors?These questions are especially relevant to the Crisis Pregnancy Agency.  Its establishment in 2001 was a recognition of the need to address crisis pregnancy in a comprehensive and effective way.  It has made progress and helped to improve support for women facing crisis pregnancy.  Since the inception of the agency, counselling services for women in this area have expanded significantly.  The agency has also played a role in helping to prevent vulnerable women from ending up in the hands of rogue pregnancy agencies.  However, the need for the work of the agency is as great as ever.  Crisis pregnancy is still, and will always be, a major problem.  What has changed to warrant dissolving the agency?  This question goes to the kernel of the Bill.  Is it really about enhancing efficiency and co-ordination or is it simply a money-saving exercise?  We need clarity; we need the bare facts laid before us.  Whatever answers we are given, time will tell, but we also need to know what mechanisms are in place to monitor the effectiveness of the work formerly carried out by these agencies and now to be carried out by the Department and the HSE.  I have made this point already and I re-emphasise it.I welcome the amendment of the Hepatitis C compensation scheme to remove age limits for travel insurance.  The National Cancer Screening Service Board is also to be dissolved and its functions subsumed within the HSE, becoming part of the HSE's cancer control programme.  The Bill provides for the National Cancer Registry Board to be appointed by the Minister, yet it is also to be subsumed into the cancer control programme in 2010.  Will this be an interim board pending the change in 2010?  If so, what will its functions be over that period?  I hope the Minister of State will address the questions I have raised during the course of this contribution.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	175	As I was saying, the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education is to be subsumed into my office, but this will not require any statutory change.  The OECD mentioned in particular the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for the way in which it interacts with the main Government Departments and other agencies.  This step is in keeping with the announcement in the budget that we will be rolling out an free early-years preschool system for all three and four year olds.  The centre will bring to the Department a level of expertise that has hitherto been farmed out to other agencies, which is welcome.  It has been suggested the Government is afraid to make tough decisions, but we have been making extremely tough decisions, and this has been recognised internationally.  The Deputies do not have to take our word for it.  Many commentators have noted that the tough measures in the emergency budget and last October's budget attracted much praise for the mettle shown by the Minister for Finance.The health reform programme acknowledged that there was a need to streamline the number of health sector agencies with a view to achieving a more co-ordinated system.  This objective was echoed in the Government's plans, announced last year, for the rationalisation of State agencies.  The primary aim in rationalising these bodies is to streamline service delivery in the health service and promote service integration.  The proposals are consistent with and build upon progress to date with agency rationalisation in the sector under the overall health reform programme.  However, the Minister expects financial efficiencies to be gained over time due to economies of scale and the elimination of duplication in areas such as recruitment, procurement, payroll and ICT systems.Deputies have raised concerns that the impact of the Women's Health Council and the National Council on Ageing and Older People will be diminished when they are integrated into the Department.  The primary function of these two agencies is to give advice to the Minister.  The repositioning of this advisory function with regard to women's health and older people in the Department will facilitate the Minister in formulating policy in these areas.  It has often been a criticism that Departments do not have the expertise to formulate policy, and these steps will serve to address that perceived shortfall.  Employees will be transferred under the Bill and their expertise, therefore, will be retained as they become civil servants in the Department.Employees of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the National Cancer Screening Service Board will be transferred to the HSE and thus their skills will remain within the public health service.  In the case of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, the Bill expressly provides for the transfer of functions to the HSE in line with legal advice.  The work of these bodies will be continued within the HSE and the integration of their functions and staff will be carefully managed to ensure the seamless continuation of services.The National Cancer Registry will be integrated within the HSE in due course and the amendment to the board's structures is, as was outlined by the Minister, intended to forge closer links between the registry and the HSE's national cancer control programme.  The board is currently composed of up to ten persons appointed by the Minister, seven of whom are appointed on the nomination of particular bodies such as the Irish Cancer Society and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  The Bill provides for the appointment of a seven-person board with knowledge or experience of the collection, recording and analysis of information, the use of such information in research projects, or the management and planning of services.Deputies have asked how they might ensure services are not impaired on the integration of the five agencies within the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  There are well-established accountability arrangements in place.  The Minister is accountable to the Oireachtas and the chief executive of the HSE is required to appear before Oireachtas committees.  Both the Department and the Health Service Executive publish annual reports which set out activities and service developments and which are, appropriately, subjected to the not inconsiderable glare of the media.I thank Deputies for their contributions.  The Minister looks forward to further constructive examination of the Bill on Committee Stage.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	177	As Deputies will be aware, the rates of child benefit have increased significantly since 2001, having trebled for the first two children and increased by over 185% for the third and subsequent children.  Partly as a result of this and partly as a result of an increase in the number of eligible children, overall expenditure on child benefit grew from just under £760 million — the equivalent of €965 million — in 2001 to nearly €2.5 billion in 2008.The Government is proud to have been able to direct such substantial increases in financial support to all Irish families in recent years.  However, given the scale of the current economic crisis, it is necessary to address all aspects of the public finances in order to avoid excessive borrowing and ensure that fairness exists in the allocation of resources.  It was in this context that the Minister for Finance announced in the supplementary budget the Government's intention to subject child benefit to income tax or to means test it from 2010.The issues concerning which approach to adopt are considerable.  I understand the Commission on Taxation is considering the issues underlying the possible taxation of child benefit.  Its deliberations will inform the Government's final decision on how to proceed.  The Department has advised the commission of the practical issues involved in taxation of child benefit.The alternative approach of means testing the almost 600,000 families in receipt of child benefit would be administratively cumbersome and costly.  Difficulties would have to be overcome with regard to the appropriate treatment of different types of income,  establishing the composition of the household and considering how income is distributed within the household.Careful consideration also needs to be given to the likely consequences of both approaches.  For example, any option to tax or means test child benefit could result in disincentives to take up employment and lead to a reduction in participation levels because it would raise the amount of wages required to replace the level of welfare previously received.  It could also lead to a depression of activity levels whereby people would attempt to stay below the different tax thresholds by reducing hours worked or job sharing.  Any possible inconsistency of treatment as between cohabiting and married couples also needs to be considered.  In addition, the implications for low-income households must be examined carefully, for example, in cases where income from child benefit would bring such households over the thresholds for liability to tax.  The Department, together with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, will be giving the matter careful consideration over the coming months in anticipation of the report by the Commission on Taxation.Since 1944, child benefit has been a key instrument in child income support policy, its main objectives being to support families in the costs of rearing children and to alleviate poverty.  I assure the House that a decision on how best to proceed will not be taken lightly by the Government.

I suppose it summarises the thoughts of Government but not the consequences of what it intends to do.I shall put to the Minister an example I received today from a constituent.  Her family has lost €8,000 in real terms annually because of the public service levies.  She has four children aged under five and has lost an additional €4,000 through the abolition of the early child care supplement.  Her basic question concerns how we value children and how we consider the actual burden — a word I do not like to use — placed on families when they have children and the responsibilities that follow.In her response the Minister briefly mentioned the issue of disincentives which would be my biggest concern if either a tax or means testing were to be introduced. There are already several poverty traps in the social welfare system which create disincentives for people to take up employment if such employment exists.  First, how great is the Minister's concern that introducing means testing or a tax might create the greatest of all poverty traps for people with families?  Second, has any thought been given to the idea of having tax credits for families with children if either of these schemes is to be introduced?  A constituent said to me this week that in our taxation system her bins are valued more than her children.  She can get a tax credit for her bin but not for her children.  When one puts it that way one has to wonder how we value children.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	179	The real case the Deputy outlined is a particularly difficult one for that family. Notwithstanding that the mother will get one year's free preschooling for each of her children, there is a considerable income loss for her and I appreciate that.   We would be very conscious of that in whatever decisions we take in the next budget, bearing in mind what has happened in this one.  The two measures will have to be seen with regard to how they impact on families.The disincentive effect is very real when one looks to try to improve social welfare in any way.  We have had other examples and there have been letters to the paper that everybody has probably seen, concerning a family with four children.  When they listed all they were entitled to on welfare they were doing better than they would be at work.  That should never be the case.The family income supplement is in place to support people but there would not be much point in taking with the one hand to give back with the other, all coming from a social welfare payment designed to support people with children.  This is one of the issues we shall consider because it would be very wrong that somebody on social welfare should have a greater incentive to stay that way compared to the person on low income who is actually working.  These are all issues we must thrash out in respect of future policy in respect of child benefit.

That makes me wonder why this is being driven so hard.  If everyone in the House were to add them up we would have thousands of examples of people who are better off remaining on social welfare.  I have a real concern that if we go down the road proposed by the Government in respect of child benefit we will create even more examples and will force people, especially those with a number of children, to remain in unemployment rather than seek work.  I ask the Minister to impress that fact on the Minister for Finance.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I certainly will.  There are many issues relating to child benefit.  It has been a universal payment for a very long time.  There were some years during which the tax credit given for children was reduced on account of benefit and so at one stage there was a link between tax and child benefit but it was eased out.  There are people who depend on child benefit and even those who do not depend on it to provide basics for their children use it for them, perhaps for extra activities, or whatever.  I am conscious that is the case.  However, it is costing us €2.5 billion and that is why we have had to look at all the schemes and every element of the social welfare budget, particularly at a time when people are taking drops in their income in the private sector.  I fully accept the point that we must ensure we do not create any further disincentives.  However, let everybody be warned that as soon as we try to do anything with the current entitlements under social welfare opposition voices inside and outside the House will be the very ones to say not to touch it.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I know, but it makes life very difficult when one is trying to find a balance when people who are not dependent on social welfare are taking drops in their income.  We must ensure we do not have a disincentive for them to go on social welfare and be better off there.  That will be the overall principle but it is too early to say what will happen in its regard in the future.  There are considerable complications attached to either taxing or means testing, regardless of the policy decision attached.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	184	Since the Green Paper on pensions was published in October 2007, the economic landscape has changed significantly in Ireland and the rest of the world.  This has resulted in significant difficulties for pension scheme members, trustees and employers, related to the collapse in equity values and significant losses in pension funds.Given these changed circumstances, the Government has moved to assist defined benefit schemes and their members through measures announced in December 2008 and more recent announcements.  These include the establishment of a pensions insolvency payment fund, a reordering of wind-up priorities, provision for restructuring of pension benefits and stronger regulation with regard to remittance of pension contributions.  These measures have been introduced to assist workers who are facing real and immediate difficulties with their defined benefit entitlements.The Government is fully aware that the challenges facing our pension system go beyond these immediate difficulties.  Members of defined contribution schemes have also faced losses in the value of their funds.  In addition to these immediate pressures we are also faced with challenges relating to pensions coverage, the sustainability of our pensions system, the adequacy of current provision and the issues raised in the Green Paper in relation to social welfare pensions.It is the intention of the Government to deal with all of these issues.  It is important that the decisions we make are the correct ones, given that these decisions will have a significant impact on this generation and the next.  Our objective must be a pension system which will deliver an adequate retirement income for all which is, at the same time, affordable and sustainable for the State and those who sponsor and provide occupational pension schemes.  It is also important that an appropriate balance is struck between all stakeholders.This Government has responded to the immediate pressures facing pension scheme members in a way we deem to be fair and equitable.  We will continue to discuss further long-term reform options for inclusion in the final framework and I expect that this will be published in the near future.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	185	The reality is that we have been waiting years for this Government to address the pensions crisis facing the country.  It is 19 months since the Green Paper was published and we are still awaiting a White Paper on the way forward.  The minor changes the Minister made in December and this week amount to nothing more than robbing Peter to pay Paul.  She is not doing anything fundamental in terms of addressing the major problem of the deficit in so many pension schemes.When will the Minister set out where the country is going in relation to pensions?  Pension schemes are losing money by the week.  There is a major problem as regards the over-emphasis and over-concentration on tax relief as a way of dealing with pensions.  I have already asked the Minister to kindly come up with figures in that regard, and I now ask her again.  The only figure we have for tax relief on pensions and its cost relates to 2006, and that is a global figure.  Will the Minister produce figures for us before she announces the Green Paper that will provide data showing the different elements of the current pension provision costs?  I am particularly concerned about the cost to the Exchequer of the self-administered schemes.  Will she, therefore, be in a position to provide the data prior to the publication of the White Paper?How does she intend to proceed in regard to pensions, given that millions of public and private money has been lost in the past year, in particular through gambling on the stock markets?  Does she intend to take a new approach to pension provision and, if so, will it have the State pension at its core?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The measures taken in recent months were obviously to deal with the current difficulties that have arisen and were not designed for the long term.  The framework document will deal with the long-term issues.  Other countries that have introduced long-term frameworks have set out a timescale for their commencement.  For example, the UK measure will not start before 2012.  The measures we will take, depending on the type of decisions we make, will obviously require legislation and a starting point that will not be this year or next.  Given that it will have implications that will affect all workers for the next generation, it is important to get it right.  The Green Paper was published at the end of 2007, but following on that there were some 380 submissions, various conferences and a number of meetings.  I met with the unions, the women's council, the Senior Citizens' Parliament and various other groups that made submissions.  We will shortly publish that long-term framework document.As regards the Deputy's question about self-administered schemes, the Revenue does not collect specific data in that regard. The tax reliefs available amount to approximately €2.9 billion, as we know, but it does not have the specific data in relation to that because it claims the resources required would be disproportionate to the value of the work of Revenue.  However, when Revenue carried out an audit of the schemes a very high compliance level was found.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	187	This has nothing to do with tax compliance, but rather with the cost to the Exchequer.  I put it to the Minister that unless she is in a position to provide information on what the different types of pension relief are costing the taxpayer, her framework document will have no credibility.  She should kindly get the figures and let us know how much tax reliefs to certain categories of pension schemes are costing.  Again, does she accept that on grounds of equity and value for money we must move away from the tax relief-based pension approach and put a basic decent State pension at the core of any future pension policy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	188	The State pension is at the core of the Government's provision.  The value of the State pension is €5.4 billion, and it is certainly at the core of what we do.  The increases in the level of the State pension in recent years has certainly helped to support pensions.  For the future, we must ensure individuals also take responsibility to supplement that and to ensure private personal provision is in place.  We must also ensure the balance is right between the State, the individual and the employer.

Nonetheless, we are trying to determine what the balance should be for the future, how we can support people and have a more balanced approach in terms of tax reliefs, the benefit to the individual of the State pension, and so on, while at the same time ensuring more people make provision.  I expect, genuinely, to be in a position over the next few weeks to publish the document.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	194	The recent supplementary budget provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% with effect from 1 June 2009 in the expectation that landlords will reduce their rents, given the reductions in rent levels in the private rental market as a whole.  While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.Data published by the CSO show that rents fell by almost 7% between November 2008 and February 2009.  A leading property website reports that rents have fallen by around 12% in the past year.  A similar trend is apparent in tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  There are currently almost 85,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 42% since the end of December 2007.  It is essential that State support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords.Other changes in the supplementary budget provide for new maximum rent limits to be prescribed in regulations to take effect from 1 June 2009 to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels as well as an increase of €6 in the minimum contribution towards rent and mortgage interest supplement to €24 a week.Existing recipients of rent supplement will be advised by letter in advance of the change being made to their rent payment and this communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases.  Landlords will be advised through advertising in the print media of the general reduction in rent supplement payments.Community welfare officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case, for example, where homelessness might result due to the inability of a person to meet his or her rent payment.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I agree that significant savings can be made in the area of rent supplement and that there should be a reduction in what landlords receive.  However, I have a difficulty with the manner in which the Minister is approaching this.  She is, in effect, asking 85,000 households to negotiate directly with their landlords.  Some will have the ability to do this, but others will not.  The Minister referred twice in her statement to expectations as regards landlords' remuneration decreasing.  She is operating from a position of hope, in believing this is something that will happen.  Will the Minister or her Department take any action directly?  Since the Department has the names and addresses of the landlords through the forms people fill out for rent supplement, will it make contact with them?  As regards advertising in the media, a landlord can open a local paper and close it again, without concurring that he should decrease his rent charges by 8%.The Minister has chosen a blanket figure of 8%, while the figures for rent up and down the country are very different.  She admitted last week, for example, that there is a real problem with tenants in bed-sits, particularly in Dublin inner city and perhaps in other highly populated areas.  It is an unfair way to do it.  In some places, it has gone down by as much as 13% while in others, it has only gone down by 5%.  It is a totally inequitable way to do it.  The Minister could have made greater savings in some areas which she could have offset against areas in which she will make fewer savings.In addition to the print media, I hope the Minister has another plan to get in touch with landlords to try to achieve this.  I did not expect the Minister to double in the past six months what the tenant must pay which, coupled with this reduction, will leave some people homeless.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	196	There is no reason anybody should be homeless as a result of this.  Landlords throughout the country are reducing rent where the tenant seeks a renegotiation because people have taken a drop in their income.  I have yet to meet anybody whose rent has not been reduced because of a change in their personal circumstances.  Landlords are the first to know that the market is such that they cannot command the type of rent levels they were getting.The letter each tenant will get from the Department will be the official way of him or her telling the landlord he or she is not getting as much as he or she was.  It will be more than just the advertising by the Department in newspapers.  That information will come from both sides.The increase demanded of each tenant, bringing the weekly contribution a tenant must make to €24, is still less than one would pay on RAS or if offered social housing.  We have evidence that people turned down the opportunity to move off rent supplement because they were in a better location or in better accommodation on rent supplement and paying less.  It was a disincentive.  That is the reason we felt it was reasonable, although difficult, to increase it.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	197	The difference is that people in receipt of RAS and people in local authority accommodation can work as much as they want.  People on rent supplement cannot do that.  The Minister is not making a fair argument because people do not have that opportunity if on rent supplement.  In the majority of cases, she is taking that money directly out of the social welfare payment.Why did the Minister not examine the idea of insisting that the Revenue Commissioners, through her Department and the Private Residential Tenancies Board, ensure they get all taxation due on these properties rather than only penalise the tenant?  If we ensured all landlords paid tax, it would be a definite way for the Minister to get greater funding into the Exchequer, although I appreciate not specifically into her Department.  She could have gone down that road instead of penalising the tenant by increasing the amount he or she must pay.

Accepting that rents in some areas have come down by a lot more, it is our intention when setting the new rent limits to ensure we take that into account.  Some will come down further, in particular where there is much availability of accommodation.  Where there is limited availability, we will probably reduce it by 6% or 7%.  That will come up when rents are up for review.The question of income is important.  The PRTB and the registration of landlords are one way to ensure Revenue has that information, which it uses.  We want to ensure that happens.

Facilitators develop individual progression plans with the customer, are located throughout the country and are assigned to cover a geographical area.  Facilitators work closely with FÁS and other agencies at a local level to identify and target appropriate education, training and development opportunities.The social and economic participation programme, under the national development plan, provides for the enhancement of the facilitator network of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  This commenced in September 2008 and to date, 20 additional facilitators have been appointed.  A further ten facilitators will be appointed in the coming months bringing the total number in place to 70.A facilitator deals with referrals from local offices, the Department's inspectorate and people in receipt of social welfare payments who may decide to seek the service of a facilitator.  The facilitator service may also be sought by someone who has a business idea, who wishes to avail of the back-to-work enterprise allowance or by someone who intends to return to education under the back-to-education programme.  In addition, one of the roles of the Department's facilitators is to engage with other agencies to enhance local working relationships and to ensure that agencies work together to provide services to customers in receipt of welfare payments.  Facilitators are also engaged in extensive information provision to individuals, organisations and communities about the services of the Department.In addition to the local referral system, a formal targeted programme of activation was introduced under the NDP.  Under this programme, the Department actively selects cases for referral to facilitators.  The first cases issued to facilitators in September 2008.   Currently, 40 such cases are referred to each facilitator each month.  The current economic climate has determined that a large part of a facilitator's work is with people on the live register.The work carried supports people to progress from welfare to work and complements the Department's control activity.  If a person on the live register is offered an opportunity to engage with a facilitator but refuses to do so, he or she is referred to the Department's local office for control follow up.The facilitator service was enhanced under the national development plan's social and economic participation programme.  There will shortly be 70 facilitators.  Clerical support is provided.Facilitators work in co-operation with other relevant service providers such as FÁS, VECs, the adult education guidance initiative, the HSE and other local agencies.  The number of facilitators in place, their workload and the effectiveness of the service will continue to be monitored under the national development plan.

There is some progress.  If facilitators are to work, they must have time to spend with people.  Sadly, they must deal with an ever-increasing group of people who have varied needs from lone parents to people with disabilities to people who are unemployed.When the Minister launched something for one parent families a few months ago, she spoke about the pilot schemes in Coolock and Kilkenny.  She said where participation was voluntary, take up was low which pointed to a need for a more active process to give lone parents encouragement and so on.  To have a more active process, facilitators need to have more time to spend with people.  I do not see how 70 facilitators can deal with this, given the scale of unemployment we face.I make the comparison with career guidance teachers and the 60,000 or so leaving certificate students.  I know career guidance teachers must deal with the entire school but the focus is on students in the final years in which choices must be made.  There are a lot more career guidance teachers relative to the number of students compared with the number of facilitators relative to the number of unemployed, not to mention lone parents and people with disabilities.While I accept other organisations are involved, I question the ability of facilitators to deal with their workload given there are so few of them.  The Minister said she is monitoring this.  Does see she more facilitators being employed or does she see more active involvement by other agencies working with her Department which can engage with people on a one-to-one basis?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I would like to see both but I am not sure how many more facilitators we will be able to get in the immediate term given that we have so many other staff coming in for progressing, control, inspection etc.  As I indicated, the facilitators mostly concentrate on people on the live register.  We must remember that when the first facilitators were appointed, they dealt with people on the live register who were long-term unemployed and who probably needed a bit more intensive work and more personal attention than a number of people on the live register now who, in some cases, are very capable of finding things for themselves once they have the information and of working with other agencies.There is much duplication of agencies which are all trying to service the same group.  We aim to ensure greater co-operation between FÁS, the local employment service, the partnerships, the adult education guidance initiative, the HSE when it concerns people with disabilities and our facilitators in identifying those people whose needs can be met by working with those agencies.  That is happening in some areas.

I am concerned that unemployment is continuing to increase rapidly, even in areas where there is what the Minister described last week as a "plethora" of groups.  Are the facilitators able to cut through the layers of bureaucracy to assist people and get them onto courses?  When the Minister spoke last July about people under the age of 25, she said her officials were spending the summer identifying young people in the regions who were eligible for appropriate educational training schemes.  How many young people were brought onto such schemes as a result of the engagement of her officials over the summer months?  I presume the officials in question were departmental facilitators, in some areas at least.  How many people applied through those officials to get onto the schemes in question?  I do not refer to people who submitted applications themselves, for example through other agencies.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I do not have figures for July and August 2008, when the officials in question were very active.  They have dealt with 10,000 new cases since September 2008.  That was the real focus.  The fact there has been an increase in the number of people availing of the back to education scheme is evidence of that.  That was a successful project.  It is an example of the success that can be achieved when certain people are targeted.  This type of co-ordination is taking place at local level.  The facilitators are at the centre of it.  I met some facilitators in Dún Laoghaire recently.  I also met some facilitators in Castleblayney two weeks ago.  I was told that certain things are being dealt with by certain officials.  They are co-ordinating it between them.  We need this type of co-ordination of service.  I accept that everybody on the live register needs some kind of support.  The level of intensive support the facilitators originally set out to provide is probably not necessary for everybody.  I am interested in trying to continue to support it, however.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	205	As part of its reform of the health sector, the Government has decided to transfer responsibility for the General Register Office, for certain disability-related income support schemes and for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and associated staff, including community welfare officers, from the Health Service Executive to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  Responsibility for the General Register Office transferred to the Department on 1 January last.  The transfer of responsibility for the domiciliary care allowance scheme has commenced.  New claims are being accepted in the Department.  The transfer of all existing cases will be completed by September of this year.  Arrangements will then be made for the transfer of the blind welfare allowance scheme.The transfer of responsibility for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the largest part of the transfer programme.  A considerable amount of preparatory work has been completed.  The necessary legislation has been passed, subject to a commencement order.  The number and location of the posts to be transferred has been agreed.  Agreement has been reached with the HSE about accommodation, finance and other support arrangements.  Detailed discussions have taken place with the relevant trade unions.  As it was not possible to reach agreement with the unions that represent community welfare officers about pay, superannuation and other matters, it has been decided that such issues should be referred to the national industrial relations institutions to find a resolution.Community welfare officers and the local office staff of the Department are under a good deal of pressure as they deal with increased unemployment levels.  As they provide a service to the same people, it makes perfect sense for them to operate within a unified management structure.  The integration of the community welfare service into the Department of Social and Family Affairs will result in a more co-ordinated approach to the provision of services to the public and will remove duplication of work.  The transfer will not lead to any changes in the exercise of discretion by community welfare officers.  The flexibility and responsiveness which is inherent in the scheme will remain.  I am anxious that every effort be made to complete the arrangements for the transfer as soon as possible.  I recognise that the transfer represents a change for the community welfare staff.  It also represents a major organisational challenge for the Department.  While a number of human resources issues remain to be resolved, I am confident this can be done in the coming months.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Will the Minister clarify her comment that responsibility for all schemes, with the exception of the blind welfare allowance, will be transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs by September of this year?  Is that subject to agreement at the discussions with the national industrial relations institutions?  Will it happen anyway?  One cannot hand over all the schemes if those who administer them do not come with the handover.  If this plan goes ahead as the Minister has outlined, the Department of Social and Family Affairs will assume responsibility for a system that is creaking at the seams.  I think the officials have described it as being past breaking point.  I discussed the matter with community welfare officers at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  I suggest that additional staff should be deployed from elsewhere in the Department to administer the community welfare service.  Does the Minister envisage that will happen?  She will be aware that the number of requests for community welfare services has increased by 85% in recent times.  The number of community welfare officers has not changed, however.  I accept that all Departments are subject to the embargo on public service recruitment.  The queues at social welfare offices are growing, rather than decreasing.  The number of people who wish to avail of the community welfare service is also increasing.  When these responsibilities are transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, it will have to deal with both problems.  Will the Department be able to put in place the necessary staff?  If the main social welfare service is failing, at least the back-up community welfare service should be able to give people what they need.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The transfer of responsibility for the supplementary welfare scheme is conditional on the agreement of staff.  Approximately 1,000 officials will transfer to the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It is a huge transfer for them.  It is a huge logistical operation for the Department.  Its total number of staff will increase to approximately 5,300.  I do not doubt it will lead to greater integration and better streamlining of the services provided to individuals.  That is what it is all about.  A number of issues have to be resolved.  Agreement has been reached on some issues, but certain terms and conditions continue to present difficulties.  Some of the officials in question are public servants, as opposed to civil servants.  Issues such as career paths and pay structures also need to be resolved.  We have clarified some matters, such as accommodation and discretion.  I believe the outstanding issues can be resolved in the next few months.  The community welfare officers are seeking clarity.  Matters will become clearer when everyone is part of the same system.  People seem to be in limbo at present.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I would like to ask a brief supplementary question about an issue I have already raised.  I refer to the demands being imposed on the social welfare service and the community welfare service by the lengthening queues.  Will more staff be deployed from within the resources of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to deal with such problems?  The community welfare service is at breaking point.  The Minister's comments about the integration of services have tempted me to ask questions about the issue of independence.  I will not go into that now.  Community welfare officers make sure that applicants are likely to be eligible for the social welfare benefit for which they have applied, and are waiting for, before they agree to make supplementary payments to such people.  When they sanction the making of a payment, it is made within a short space of time.  By contrast, people in Boyle, for example, currently have to wait 19 weeks to receive jobseeker's allowance payments.  I suggest that the Minister should examine whether the manner in which the community welfare service operates can be applied in her Department.  Community welfare officers do not sanction payments if they are not sure that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will make a social welfare payment in the end.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I accept what the Deputy is saying about the situation in Boyle.  I will come back to that.  The manner in which the HSE is governed by the public sector recruitment embargo has affected community welfare offices that are in need of staff increases.  My Department, however, has been able to increase its numbers and has sought a further increase.  When it assumes responsibility for the community welfare system, it will have some scope to better support the work of the community welfare offices.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I accept that becoming unemployed and having to claim jobseeker's payment is extremely difficult for people.  I am trying to ensure the process of making a claim is as easy as possible.  In 2008, we commenced a review of the processes and procedures for accepting and making decisions on claims.  Certain initiatives have been introduced at all local and branch offices.  A streamlined process has been introduced for people who had made a claim in the previous two years.  The application form has been simplified so that claimants have to provide only details of any circumstances that have changed since the previous claim.  A simplified procedure has been introduced to assist those who have to move to jobseeker's allowance when their period of jobseeker's benefit expires.  More straightforward procedures for providing evidence of identity and address have been introduced.  Application forms for jobseeker's schemes are now available on the Department's website, which contains comprehensive information on claiming jobseeker's payment, including details of the supporting documents that are required.  When a person makes a claim for jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance, he or she can download and complete a claim form and bring it to his or her nearest local office.  In addition, we have introduced an appointment system for taking claims in offices with high volumes of claims.  Under this initiative, when a person first attends at a local office to claim, he or she is given details of the supporting documents required together with an appointment to attend to have his or her claim taken.  The appointment system has been introduced in 14 local offices to date, seven of which are in Dublin.  It is being extended to three other offices over the coming weeks, two of which are in Dublin.  This initiative has been particularly effective in reducing queuing in local offices and it has also helped improve processing times where the customer provides supporting documentation at the point of claim.  This initiative will be extended to a number of other offices over the coming months having regard to the volume of new claims at particular offices.We are reviewing the processes involved in administering claims for those who are working reduced hours, such as part-time, casual and systematic short time.  The existing arrangements are very labour intensive and it is envisaged that more streamlined arrangements, which will benefit customers and the Department, will be introduced in the near future.These improvements are part of a programme of initiatives being developed by the Department to streamline processes and procedures in local and branch offices and it is intended that further improvements will be introduced on an ongoing basis during 2009.

What has happened so far is not working.  I have already cited the example of Boyle.  The five towns with the longest waiting periods, Edenderry, Navan and Tuam, at 15 weeks and the other two at 13 weeks, have been at the top of the list for at least the past six months.  I know Edenderry particularly well.  There has been no dramatic factory closure there since last summer although there have been small and steady closures and rising numbers.  Printing out one's form on-line and so on is all very well but the Minister needs a sea change in the operation of this service when unemployment is rising so rapidly.  The Minister said in response to an earlier question that supplementary welfare payment is paid for only a week or two.  It must be paid out in these instances for much longer.  In Boyle, it has obviously been paid out for 19 weeks because otherwise people are living on nothing.The Minister will probably tell me that the average waiting time is six weeks and only two weeks in Ballymun but that is no comfort to the people in Boyle, Edenderry or Bandon.  How will the Minister make changes now, particularly in these areas?I met a social welfare officer the other day who has been out sick for nearly a fortnight.  That person is responsible for means testing and all of those files are building up in her absence.  Nobody is dealing with them while she is out sick.  She will probably have to go out sick again a few weeks after her return to work to recover from the stress she will face.  What kind of system has nobody to fill in the gaps when people get sick or go on maternity leave?  We all accept that happens.  Private sector employers must accommodate that.  The social welfare system must accommodate it too.

Where the improvements have been introduced they are working very well.  I invite the Deputy to see any of the offices where the appointment system is in place.

There is a particular difficulty with 14 of the branch offices, including some of those the Deputy mentioned.  The local office support units are working specifically with those to try to reduce their claims, with Boyle being a case in point.  Deciding officers have moved into some branch offices for a short time to free up the decision-making process and to work with them.  The particular issue seems to rest with the branch offices.There has been a meeting with the branch officers and another is taking place today to address these issues because their claims are then sent to the local office.  Different processing arrangements are being put in place to try to improve those particular offices.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I welcome the fact that an appointments system has been put in place in some offices and I am glad that the Minister took on our suggestion.  This should have happened earlier.  I accept that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people applying and that has put serious pressure on the system but the Minister has failed to gear up the Department to deal adequately with that.  While we understand that this is a new situation and there are considerable pressures, that is no excuse for people who depend on the Department in order to survive.  A total of 28 social welfare offices have waiting times of more than two months.  By any standard, that is completely unacceptable.Last month during Question Time I asked the Minister about the particular problem affecting the branch offices.  The Minister seemed to deny it, telling us it was all in hand and that she was dealing with it.  She is not dealing with it.  There are serious problems and she has not given us any grounds to expect that the issue will be dealt with soon.  To what extent has she attempted to quantify the problem?  How many staff does she believe are required now?  Are all of the 115 extra staff all in place?  How many additional staff does she believe are required to bring the waiting times down to an acceptable limit?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	222	In fact, 230 additional staff have been in place in the past few months doing processing.  In addition, 16 more inspectors are doing means testing.  There has been a significant increase in the number of staff and there has also been an increase in productivity.  New systems have been put in place and the appointments system is just one of them.  The Dundalk office spearheaded that system.  It ran into some difficulties, overcame them and it is now possible to spread them out.  In order to counteract the delays in some of the offices, such as the branch offices, we have set up four central decision units which do nothing else.  They do not meet the public but the forms are sent to them.  They are in Dublin, Sligo, Finglas and Carrick-on-Shannon.  We have started on three new ones in Roscommon, Wexford and Tallaght.The local office support units are helping the branch offices with claims in hand and in some cases deciding officers are spending a short time with them.  When a branch office manager retires, we have considered whether it is appropriate to keep the office going in that manner.  Changes have come about following retirements in Carrigaline, Loughrea and Tullamore where we replaced the branch offices with local offices because of the demand.  Following a retirement in Tulla in Clare, the office was replaced with another branch.  Each one is considered carefully.

I accept that there is a problem in the 14 branch offices that we have highlighted here but there is a problem in other areas too.  What will the Minister do about the fact that when people are out sick or on maternity leave, the system seems to break down in those offices because there are not enough trained people?  Will the Minister give me a commitment today on her aim?  When will there be a system in which everybody is operating at best practice and nobody is waiting more than a few weeks for a claim to be processed?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The central units are the way to go because they concentrate on the decision-making.  Having the four already and three new ones to come will make serious in-roads into any delays.  The level of applications coming in is still extraordinarily high although it seems to have abated somewhat but a significant number come in every week.  We have requested an additional 300 staff over and above those we have put in, if the pace of applications continues at its current rate.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The current range of payment options offered by the Department to customers includes payment at a local post office, or to a bank or building society account, or certain credit unions that have been authorised by the banking and credit union regulators.Other than jobseekers, customers can opt for a payment method having regard to their own personal circumstances.  The Department administers a variety of schemes which have a weekly and monthly payment cycle.  For operational reasons and to facilitate the distribution of payments through the post office network, each scheme is assigned a day of the week for payment.  These measures ensure that payments to be distributed through post offices are evenly spread across the week.  A person can collect their payment on the due date or within a number of days thereafter.Of the 1.4 million customers paid each week, over 725,000 — some 51% of them — are paid at a post office on various days throughout the week.  A further 81,000 collect their early child care supplement on the third Monday of each month, and 252,000 customers collect their child benefit payment on the first Tuesday of each month.  When new schemes are introduced, such as early child care supplement or customers move from cheque to electronic payments, care is taken to ensure that the day assigned does not unduly impact on existing arrangements at post offices.As the numbers claiming social welfare increase significantly, the Department must ensure that strict controls are in place in order to prevent fraud and abuse.  Staff in post offices are required to satisfy themselves that they are making payment to the person entitled to receive that payment.  This has generally been done through signature verification.  The introduction of photo identification for those of working age, such as jobseekers and lone parents, is designed to strengthen security measures in order to prevent abuse of the social welfare system.  Post office staff can ask for photo identification and if there are any difficulties with the identification being produced they can alert investigators in the Department.The Department is aware that a small number of post offices are experiencing long queues at certain times of the day.  This is under review by An Post which is responsible for the post office network and the operation of individual post offices, including security.  I am satisfied with the measures being taken in post offices to ensure that the correct payment is being made to the right person, and that customers are not unduly inconvenienced while collecting payments in post offices.

I appreciate that part of this matter is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  The biggest concern is about unemployment payments on the first day they are delivered.  I accept that people can collect them on different days but the problem is on the first day because they want to receive it.  I wonder if that system could be divided in any way.  Could the matter at least be examined to see if pressure can be eased?  The Minister should discuss with An Post the facilities it is making available to people.  In some instances there are adequate staff, but An Post only supplies one computer.I have also raised this issue because recently I was in a very small village and I was shocked when I heard how much was delivered to the post office for social welfare payments.

That postmaster said there is a real risk for them.  They are in a rural area and there is no full-time Garda station, yet this massive amount of money is being deposited there.  If the payments could be ordered twice a week it would make it somewhat safer for small post offices.It is not the Minister's fault and it is up to individuals to opt for the method of payment.  It would be a help, however, if more people changed their options.

From the end of September 2009 no books will be printed, so that will alleviate the problem for some.  Looking at what customers are paid on different days, however, even if one was to move some jobseekers to a different day they would then impact on pensioners or some other group.Friday seems to be the worst day, with 39%, because most pensioners get their money that day.  The figures are 20% on Thursday and 21% on Wednesday.  Tuesday is a light day with 6%, and it is 14% on Monday.I appreciate the points the Deputy is making, particularly about security because of the large amounts of money involved.  On the other hand, however, as a measure to control fraud we had to ensure that people physically collect the money for reasons of which we are all aware.  Hopefully, with other payments being made by electronic transfer it should relieve some of the pressure.

However, having regard to the current budgetary circumstances, it will not be possible to proceed with this in 2009.The Citizens Information Board is monitoring the programme to ensure that the projects are operating in accordance with the board's advocacy guidelines.  It is planned to undertake a full evaluation of the community and voluntary sector advocacy programme next year.The Citizens Information Board also provides advocacy through the citizens information services, focusing on access to services, welfare entitlements and employment rights.  This type of mainstream advocacy is also open to people with disabilities.  The community and voluntary sector advocacy programme is creating close links with the citizens information services to ensure that people with disabilities are encouraged and supported to use the mainstream services where possible.The advocacy capacity is being strengthened through the provision of advocacy resource officers who work to build the capacity of information providers within the citizens information services to advocate on behalf of clients.  There are nine advocacy resource officers in operation across the citizens information services network.I am satisfied with the developments undertaken to provide advocacy services for people with disabilities through the Citizens Information Board.  Significant resources have been provided since 2005 and will continue to be made available under the auspices of the Citizens Information Board for the development and provision of advocacy services for people with disabilities.  The Department will continue to work with the board to further enhance advocacy services for all citizens, including those with disabilities.

What is the situation regarding the post of director of personal advocacy services, which was advertised in December 2007?  It was envisaged that the director could be up and running by 2008, but was that position ever filled?  I understand from a previous reply by the Minister in June 2008 that a person had been identified but that the post remained to be sanctioned.  Was the person appointed?  How much has the Minister's Department saved by not going ahead with the personal advocacy service?  How many people were going to be appointed to the service initially?  Is the Minister now telling us that the Citizens Information Act, which we passed in 2007, is more or less defunct?  Is she going down a different route, using advocacy resources officers through the citizens information service instead?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	237	The position is that the director was not appointed.  When it was decided that we were not in a position to go ahead with the personal advocacy service last year, there was not much point in appointing a director to that service.  That is on hold for the moment.The amount spent on personal advocacy from 2005 to 2008 was €6.1 million.  The amount saved on that service last year, when the decision was made, was €1.2 million.  Had it gone ahead this year it would have been a greater amount, but it was not provided for in the budget because a decision was made last summer not proceed with it.It is important to say, however, that the advocacy on offer around the country is being availed of by people with disabilities everywhere.  Some 4,153 people have availed of and benefited from an advocacy service.  The citizens information bureaux continue to provide that service, but the personal advocacy service was not possible in light of budgetary constraints.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Is the Minister saying that there is no need to go ahead with the personal advocacy service, and that the resource officers she is putting in place are doing the job instead?  Has she changed her policy in this area completely?  When she says that this is being put on hold, does she envisage it happening sometime in the future and if so, how soon?  Does she agree that there is a huge need for such a service for people with disabilities and other vulnerable people who cannot provide advocacy services for themselves?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	239	The potential for a personal advocacy service is huge, including one that is dedicated to people with disabilities that can focus on their needs.  It is always the intention of the Government to introduce it.  It is just that because of the budgetary situation, both last year and currently, it was not possible to go ahead with it.  That is why we did not appoint the director.  It is only on hold, however, until we get out of the current economic crisis.  It was purely a budgetary decision not to go ahead at the moment, rather than a policy one.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Rent supplement is intended as a short-term income support for eligible tenants whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs.  There are currently almost 85,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 42% since the end of December 2007.  Rent supplements are subject to a limit on the amount of rent an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  The objective is to ensure rent supplement is not paid in respect of excessively expensive accommodation, having regard to the size of the household and market conditions.Rent limits have recently been reviewed.  In testing the level at which basic accommodation can be secured, the Department was informed by analysis of a number of data sources.  Data published by the Central Statistics Office show rents fell by almost 7% between November 2008 and February 2009.  A leading property website reports that rents have fallen by around 12% in the past year.  A similar trend is apparent in tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.The recent supplementary budget provided for reduced maximum rent limits to be prescribed in regulations to take effect from 1 June 2009.  Rent limits will be kept under review in light of trends in the private rental market.  Payments being made to existing rent supplement tenants are being reduced by 8%.  Also, from 1 June 2009 the minimum contributions payable towards rent is being increased from €18 to €24 per week to reflect downward trends in the private rental market and align the minimum weekly contribution individuals make towards their rent under the rent supplement scheme more closely with the rents local authority tenants have to pay.Rent supplement will also be restricted to individuals who have been an existing tenant for six months.  Individuals forming new households must have been placed on a local authority housing list following a full housing needs assessment before they are eligible for rent supplement.  Some exemptions will apply and rent supplement will continue to provide support where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case, for example, where the person is at risk of experiencing homelessness and-or hardship.One of the measures introduced in recent years to address the issue of long-term rent supplementation is the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Details of the 32,000 people in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more are notified regularly to the local authorities.  Almost 19,500 tenants have been transferred from the rent supplement scheme to RAS and other social housing options since 2005 and it is expected that 9,000 further rent supplement recipients will be transferred in 2009.One of the reported impediments to the fluid transfer of rent supplement claimants to RAS is what can be a significant difference between the contribution which is required of the tenant under the rent supplement scheme and the contribution which they are required to pay through the differential rent scheme.  The increase in the contribution referred to earlier addresses this issue.Overall, I am satisfied that the current rent supplement scheme provides an adequate short-term safety net within the overall social welfare system to ensure people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.  Nonetheless, I intend to keep the scheme under review to ensure it meets the objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis while long-term housing needs are dealt with in a more appropriate manner.  I intend to consult housing officers in local authorities and community welfare officers to determine how the scheme can best meet its intended aims.

The Minister took a blanket decision to reduce them and require tenants to pay more rent.  If she had reviewed the limits, she would have made a fair decision based on the rent payable in each area.Take-up of the rental accommodation scheme is only half of what was envisaged when the scheme was announced.  Despite the brouhaha surrounding the budget announcement of 1,000 additional places under the scheme, this will increase take-up to marginally above half the number originally envisaged.  Clearly, RAS is not working and must be reviewed.In response to a priority question I tabled on this issue, the Minister stated the Revenue Commissioners have a system in place to chase down landlords, the ultimate recipients of rent supplement.  Has this system been established in recent weeks?  Some six weeks ago Deputies had an opportunity to put questions about this issue to representatives of the Revenue Commissioners and officials of the Department of Finance appearing before the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  They indicated that such a system was not in place.  Has a system been established in the meantime?If the Minister were to introduce a deposit payments scheme, as I have proposed on several occasions, it would provide a series of mechanisms to save money without immediately affecting tenants or reducing their purchasing power.  Will she establish such a scheme under the Private Residential Tenancies Board as opposed to under a new agency, given the potential of such a scheme to secure significant savings?  A deposit payments scheme would also increase the power of tenants because landlords would be unable to get their hands on deposits.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	243	A number of aspects of the rental accommodation scheme need to be reviewed.  The significant expansion of the scheme in recent years, even prior to recent developments in the area of unemployment, raises questions, particularly as regards the formation of new households, young people etc.  Issues also arise regarding the nature of the accommodation on offer, for instance, whether it is substandard.  Another issue is the ability of people on rent supplement to obtain accommodation they would not be able to afford if they were in employment.  In this context, the Department seeks to ensure we do not build into the system disincentives to work, an issue we discussed earlier.A further issue, one which I have discussed with a number of housing officers, is the number of times individuals may be permitted to refuse an offer of social housing or to participate in the rental accommodation scheme before rent supplement is discontinued.

Thus far, 19,500 people have transferred to the rental accommodation scheme.  I appreciate the importance of encouraging further transfers to the scheme.  The Department is working closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure more places are made available.While taxation is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, it is crucial that landlords meet all their tax obligations.  I will consult community welfare officers and housing officers on the operation of the scheme.  My officials are also in constant contact with officials in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government about the scheme.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	246	State expenditure of approximately €500 million per annum on rent supplement highlights the complete failure of the Government's housing strategy.  An additional 1,000 places in the rental accommodation scheme is a drop in the ocean because the vast majority of people at the lower end of the private rented sector should be in the scheme.  The Minister has failed to move quickly to address this issue.Will the Minister explain precisely how the arbitrary cut of 8% in rent payments will work?  Rents at the lower end of the market have not reduced by 8%.  I refer to the grotty bedsits located all over Dublin and in other cities.  Demand for cheap accommodation is increasing and there is no evidence to show rents have declined at the lower end of the market.  I ask the Minister to explain what will happen in the case of a person in receipt of rent supplement living in a bedsit who approaches his or her landlord — provided the landlord can be found — and asks for an 8% rent reduction on the basis that rent supplement is being reduced.  Such persons are in a contractual arrangement with their landlord and have signed a lease which could have ten months or more to run.  If the landlord responds by telling the tenant to get lost, what should the tenant do?Will the Minister confirm that no one will be made homeless as a result of this measure?  Will she guarantee that a person whose landlord refuses to reduce the rent will continue to have rent supplement paid until alternative adequate accommodation is found?  Will she also confirm that the measure will not increase costs on the State?  Given that persons who manage to exit a contract will not have their deposit returned, will these moneys not be lost to the State?Has the Minister taken legal advice on this issue because there is a legal view that the State, through the Department, is contractually obliged to honour leases already entered into with landlords?  While I am aware the leases are agreed between tenants and landlords, the Department is involved in the contract through the operation of the rent supplement scheme, for instance, landlords must fill out a form and meet tax compliance requirements.  It appears the Department is proposing to break contract law.

As I indicated, letters will issue to all tenants indicating that rent supplement will be reduced by 8%.  As a result, tenants will be required to negotiate with their landlords.  People who are working and experiencing a drop in their income are seeking and securing a reduction in their rents.  Tenants who are on the rent supplement scheme will be able to negotiate with their landlords in a similar manner.  As I indicated, community welfare officers have discretion in cases where persons are made homeless or suffer severe hardship.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	251	One of the reasons for the decision to reduce rent supplement was the substantial decline in rents throughout the country.  Rented accommodation has also become much more widely available.  Landlords are aware that existing tenants have a choice.  Losing a tenant imposes costs on landlords because they must prepare accommodation for new tenants and then find them.  They would prefer to hold on to current tenants rather than go through such a process.

I thank her for clarifying the position on whether landlords are paying tax on income from the rent supplement scheme.  I ask her to raise this matter with the Minister for Finance because it is not acceptable for her to inform Deputies repeatedly during Question Time that the issue of taxation is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  The Ministers both have seats at the Cabinet table and the Exchequer is losing revenue.I ask the Minister to withdraw her comment that people are refusing offers of council houses and remaining on rent supplement.  Failing that, she should at least provide figures on the number of people who have refused offers because I have not met any of them.  It is in very rare circumstances that somebody does that.  There are tens of thousands of people on the housing list in this country who are very anxious to get a property.

Many people on rent supplement are in very vulnerable circumstances and do not have the kind of choices people in the private sector have.  They may have children at a local school and cannot move to another part of the city.  There may be other reasons why they cannot move easily.  There may not be other accommodation available in the area.I ask the Minister to advise what is the situation because this is very important and affects many people who are, generally, in very poor circumstances.  If the landlord says he will not reduce the rent, what happens then?  Can the Minister give a guarantee such rent supplement will continue to be paid at the full rate until such time as appropriate accommodation can be sourced for the person concerned?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I am not willing to allow a situation where those on rent supplement are dictating the rents and guaranteeing landlords an income they would not get from a private tenant.  If a tenant goes to their landlord and the rent is not reduced the tenant can do exactly what they would do in a private situation, namely, threaten to leave or leave.  However, if they find themselves in a homeless situation, something we want to avoid, we would be very anxious to protect those in that most vulnerable situation and the community welfare officer has discretion to look after such people.

As we speak, 450 workers in Dell will lose their jobs today.  It is a very sad for the workers and their families.  A commitment was given by the Government that the European Global Adjustment Fund, some €500 million, would be accessed at European level.  The application was to be made by Government.  The funds would be used to provide retraining, counselling, to enable people to access alternative employment and to enable people to set up their own small business.  To date, that has not happened.I wish the 450 Dell workers concerned all the best.  They are just the first group.  In excess of 500 people will lose their jobs in Dell in July, in October another 500 will be lost and by next January another 400 will be lost, a total of 1,900 manufacturing jobs and 100 in the non-manufacturing area.  That figure does not include people in Banta Global Turnkey, where 477 jobs will be lost and Flextronics, where almost 268 are being lost, all directly related to Dell.Dell has been a great employer and provided a lot of down-stream jobs, but the contraction of its operations in Ireland has had a major exponential knock-on effect in Limerick and the wider community.  We want to see Dell remain in Limerick, where 1,000 higher-end jobs are expected to be retained.  It is extremely important not only to retain those jobs, but to build on them.  I put forward a model in terms of what Apple did in Cork.  The Government and agencies such as the IDA and other need to work with Dell to ensure we can build on the jobs.  Perhaps some of those losing their jobs today can be retrained and access some of the new jobs.In terms of the using European globalisation fund to help the workers concerned, which is the issue I want to raise today, I made direct contact with the EU Commission.  On 1 May, the new rules on the fund will apply, whereby the EU will provide 65% of the funding and the State 35%.  The current situation is 50% EU and 50% for the State.  It will apply to cases of 500 redundancies or more, whereas currently it is 1,000 redundancies.  It will apply for a two year period rather than the current one year period.  Most importantly, it relates to an economic crisis rather than displacement of jobs outside the EU.Dell in Limerick, and other companies such as Banta Global Turnkey and Flextronics, meet that requirement.  I strongly urge the Government to make a submission immediately and make the case to the EU Commission.  It can make the application prior to the full 1,900 or more redundancies taking place.  There is a worry that the number of people redundant at the time one applies will determine the amount of funding received.  A case can be made, in terms of Dell in Limerick and Banta Global Turnkey where, because we know the number of jobs which will be lost over the coming months, the fund should be drawn on straight away.It is critical to retrain people and get them back into the workforce.  I understand the new rules have been agreed at Commission level, at the employment committee stage in the European Parliament and at senior official level at the Council of Ministers.  They will be passed by the European Parliament this coming Tuesday and will be dealt with by the Council of Ministers thereafter.  They will come in to formal effect from July.  However, they will be backdated to any application submitted from 1 May.I see no reason the Government should not be ready tomorrow to make a submission to the European Commission regarding the European globalisation fund.  If the Government is not ready to make such a submission, it is because it has dragged its feet and has not been doing the work.  This is about accessing these funds.  If one looks at other countries which have accessed this funding, they have obtained approval prior to the loss of the jobs.  I want a commitment from the Minister of State that this application will be made tomorrow and the funding drawn down, and that the Government will start looking after the Dell employees and others.  We now need a positive statement from the Government that it will make this application tomorrow and access some of this €500 million in funding.

In total, up to 2,000 workers are to be made redundant at Dell.  A number of other companies that are directly linked to Dell in County Limerick have also notified the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment of related job losses.Irrespective of the timing or eventual outcome of any application to be made for EU co-funding under the EGF, the Government has already begun to put in place relevant training and employment supports to assist those workers facing redundancy in Dell to retrain, to improve their skills or to pursue educational opportunities to assist in their eventual reintegration into the workforce.  FÁS has put in place a special dedicated team to assist Dell workers in terms of individual skills assessment, occupational guidance and advice, job search assistance and the provision of training.  To date, 480 workers have been invited to group briefing sessions and one-to-one guidance interviews.  I understand some 345 workers attended the former session and 325 the latter.  In addition, 60 workers participated in an ECDL computer training course arranged by FÁS.A dedicated website, www.tusnua.ie, to assist redundant workers in assessing their options for alternative employment or further education in the mid-west region has also been put in place through a collaborative initiative between the University of Limerick, Limerick Institute of Technology, FÁS, the county and city enterprise boards, Enterprise Ireland and several other regionally located bodies.  The majority of such supports are being provided from the State’s own resources in the interim.  Any subsequent co-financing received under the EGF will therefore serve to defray some of the costs of supports already being provided or planned by the State and most likely will be received some time after these supports have been availed of by the redundant Dell workers.The House will be aware that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has established the mid-west task force, chaired by Mr. Denis Brosnan, which is assessing the impact on the wider regional economy of the decision to close most of the Dell plant in Limerick and the associated job losses in other companies.  It is also carrying out an analysis of the potential impact of the current economic downturn on the region.The Department, in conjunction with the relevant State agencies, is currently preparing an EGF application in respect of Dell redundancies.  All relevant eligibility criteria must be met to allow us to make a successful application.  This is a complex and time-consuming technical process requiring the inclusion of considerable supporting data and involving not just the Department but a number of other State agencies and external bodies.  Department officials have been also engaged in ongoing discussions with the European Commission regarding the application.  Last December the European Commission proposed, as part of the European economic recovery plan, the revision of the current EGF regulation to make it more accessible, effective and responsive.  The new application conditions will make the fund more accessible, particularly to smaller countries such as Ireland.  These include halving the applicable redundancies threshold to 500; doubling the implementation period to 24 months; increasing EU co-financing from 50% to 65%; and broadening eligibility criteria for applications made between 1 May 2009 and 31 December 2011.  However, while agreement was reached earlier this month between the European Council, Parliament and Commission, the revised regulation remains to be formally adopted by the European Parliament in its forthcoming plenary session as early as next week and subsequently by the European Council, probably in early June.The proposed changes to the EGF regulation will apply retrospectively to all applications submitted by member states from 1 May 2009.  Due to the increased accessibility of the fund, it is probable there will be a greater number of applications and the fund is likely to be deployed to greater effect than has been the case to date.  In this context it continues, therefore, to be the intention of the Minister, as stated previously in the House, to make an EGF application to cover Dell redundancies without delay.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of the palliative care and hospice support unit at St. Ita's Hospital, Newcastlewest, County Limerick.  I recognise the work of the Friends of St. Ita's in promoting this necessary service in west Limerick.  This group has been fund-raising for the provision of a palliative care and hospice unit for west Limerick for six years, since May 2003.  As a result of that fund-raising, the group has contributed €1.225 million towards the capital cost of building, furnishing and equipping the unit, which has been put at around €3 million.  In addition, Friends of St. Ita's has agreed to contribute a further €120,000 towards the final cost, which will bring the overall voluntary contribution to €1.345 million, or 44% — almost half — the capital cost of the unit.  This could not have been done without the overwhelming support and generosity of the entire community of west Limerick and beyond.  We also recognise that included in that is generous funding of €0.75 million from the McManus Pro-Am, which enabled the unit to be upgraded from a four-bed to an eight-bed unit.This was a very much a community project from the outset, as the facility was seen as being much needed for the region and was expected to augment the service already being provided by Milford Care Centre, which is up to a 50 miles distance from the homes of some people in the catchment area.  This, together with the cause itself, were factors that motivated the community considerably in the drive to have the unit built.As one might expect, with that enormous commitment, good will and generosity on the part of the community, and the effort put in by Friends of St. Ita's over time, came an understanding and expectation that the hospice unit would be opened once ready for use.  The unit has been completed, as has the final stage of furnishing and fitting, and a temporary nurse manager has been appointed internally, while the permanent post, which had been sanctioned by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, has not been filled, nor has it been advertised.  The purpose of this appointment is to prepare policies and procedures for staffing and the running of the unit.The purpose of my raising this is to impress on the Minister the requirement, because of the response of the community, that the unit be opened.  There is great disappointment and annoyance that this has not been done.  There is an unwillingness on the part of all concerned in this project to accept the delay in opening the unit beyond mid-2009.  The contract for the unit went to tender in 2007, with a commitment that it would open in 2008.  Now we are told it will not open in 2009.As I said, Friends of St. Ita's has raised close to €2 million to date which, in addition to funding for the hospice unit, has also facilitated other projects in St. Ita's Hospital, including a day room and a patient minibus service.  There has been wonderful generosity and support from all sections of the community.  The least that community can expect is that its hard work and generosity will be reciprocated by the Health Service Executive.  It must honour its commitment to staff and patients by opening the hospice unit, which is ready for use, without further delay.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  I thank Deputy Dan Neville for raising it as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House and to outline the background to the current situation and the action taken by the Health Service Executive.The executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including the new palliative care facility at St. Ita's Hospital.  The hospital was built in 1841 and has seen significant development in recent times.  In 1974, a new unit of 110 beds was built, which transformed the scale of services provided.  A new assessment and rehabilitation unit was opened in 1989 and a day hospital came on stream in 1990.  In 2004, the Friends of St. Ita's received lottery funding of €100,000 to provide support bed and day room facilities, and a further €80,000 was provided last year to develop a therapy garden.The new palliative care unit was delivered under the Health Service Executive's capital plan for 2006-2010.  It is an eight-place facility, comprising four beds and four day places, with ancillary living, dining, activity and day care facilities.  The equipping phase has commenced and the building will be in use by the end of the year as the community palliative care staff and the recently appointed clinical nurse manager will operate from it.  The total capital cost of the facility is some €2.3 million, with Friends of St. Ita’s contributing more than €1.2 million.  The associated revenue costs are approximately €1.5 million.  A new ambulant dementia unit is also scheduled to come on stream on the site.  Representatives of Friends of St Ita’s met with the Minister for Heath and Children in early March to discuss a range of issues, including bringing the new facility on stream.The overall spend on palliative care by the Health Service Executive in 2008 was in the region of €78 million.  This included new funding of €3 million provided last year to undertake various service developments.  The executive was asked to prioritise palliative care service developments in the context of a framework over the next five years.  The resulting action plan document, Palliative Care Services: Five-Year Development Framework 2009-2013, was recently submitted to the Department of Health and Children and is currently under consideration.  This document details the actions and initiatives necessary to address the gaps in palliative care service provision, against the recommendations set out in the national advisory committee on palliative care 2001.  The Health Service Executive’s four administrative areas, with the full participation of voluntary and statutory palliative care providers, has developed a set of key priorities for addressing gaps in service provision in the next five years.The Deputy will appreciate that all developments are now contingent on current economic and budgetary pressures.  The Health Service Executive has been asked to undertake a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be reconfigured or reallocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  The Government is clearly committed to the development of comprehensive palliative care services.  As I have outlined to the House, the Department of Health and Children will continue to work with the Health Service Executive and the voluntary sector to advance this objective.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	282	It is disturbing that the State, via the Department of Foreign Affairs, has facilitated a change of identity for a well-known drug trafficker.  Who was involved in the cover-up in this case and how was it allowed to happen?  I seek full and detailed particulars from the Passport Office and the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to the circumstances surrounding this issue.I am reluctant to name persons outside the House but will do so in this case. Mr. Kieran Boylan has a string of convictions for drug trafficking and drug possession.  Nevertheless, an international haulage licence was issued to him last September.  Moreover, a passport has been issued to him in Irish by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Under the relevant legislation, there is a facility for the issuing of a passport in a name that is in a language other than the language in which it appears on the applicant's birth certificate.  To my mind, however, the usage of Irish in this case has only one purpose — to avoid detection.  After all, this is a wanted man, sought by Dutch police among others.  Does he also happen to be a Gaelgóir of note?  Is he an avid user of the Irish language or a native Irish speaker?What checks were undertaken to affirm the love of the Irish language which inspired him to such a patriotic act?  What references or recommendations were sought?  Was the Garda or any appropriate person involved in the provision of information as to this man's proficiency in the Irish language?  As I said, such changes are permitted under the Passports Act 2008, but evidence of use of name in Irish should have been sought.  It is my understanding that a passport will issue in Irish only to those persons who can show they have been users of the language on a regular basis for a period of two years prior to their passport application.Is it a regular occurrence that the Department of Foreign Affairs permits criminals to change their identity for the purposes of procuring documentation that would allow them to engage in international travel and perhaps international criminality?  What checks were undertaken to ensure that this application was authentic?  I understand the English version of the name can be maintained on the passport and, in this case, was entered as an observation.  However, this was shown on a different page in the passport.  If one flashes one's passport to a police officer, customs official or immigration official, there is nothing to show that one's name is also contained therein in English.Did the Minister issue the passport under section 10(5) of the Passports Act 2008?  Who processed the application and what is on file to show the appropriate checks took place?  Did the passport officials know this man is a convicted criminal?  What inquiries were made?  If no inquiries were made, should they have been?  Were any concerns raised by any party?  What involvement had the Garda in this matter, whether local gardaí or otherwise?  The Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission is involved in an investigation of the individual in question.  Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs hand over the passport file to the commission to facilitate this inquiry?  This person has, under his Irish name, an international haulage licence, driving licence, insurance documentation and now a passport.  He was never known for proficiency in the Irish language and there is no evidence that he was a lover of the language.A genuine passport which passes all checks has been issued.  However, it was issued by the State to facilitate a completely new identity.  Jason Bourne, the fictional character of "The Bourne Supremacy" and "The Bourne Identity", would be proud of what the Department of Foreign Affairs has done in this case.  It supplied this person with a completely new identity.How can criminals be facilitated by the State in a change of name?  I have questions for the Ministers for Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I ask that this man's driving licence be immediately revoked.  However, I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to deal with the matter of the passport.  The law needs to be reviewed if international criminals of Irish origin can be fitted out with completely new identities.  In this case, the Department not only facilitated the fraud, but was instrumental in it.  The law needs to be reviewed.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I am pleased Deputy Flanagan raised this issue.  However, I am not very pleased at the manner in which he characterises Irish passports because it does damage to all of us.The fact that he has raised the issue gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, to provide the House with a full briefing and to demonstrate that nothing untoward happened in this case and that the law of the land was observed.The person in question applied for a passport in the Irish form of his name on 12 January 2009.  He submitted his previous passport in the English form of his name along with the necessary application.  The application was correctly completed and witnessed in a Garda station.It has been established by the courts that a person has a constitutional right to travel from this country.  Article 41.3 of the Constitution specifically infers that.  A person, therefore, has the right to a passport.  This is, of course, not an unfettered right and a passport can be refused in certain very limited circumstances.Section 12(1)(d) of the Passports Act 2008 requires the Minister to refuse to issue a passport where he or she has been notified by the Courts Service that a person is subject to a bail order.  However, there was no notification concerning a bail order in this case and no such order was applicable at the time of the 2009 application.  The question of previous criminal convictions had arisen in respect of previous passport applications by the person in question and these issues were resolved at the time of those applications.Accordingly, having verified the applicant's identity and citizenship, having established that the application was correctly completed and appropriately witnessed and having verified that there was no record of a bail order in respect of the person in question, the Passport Office established that the gentleman was entitled to be issued with a passport.I would like now to turn to the issue of a person's request for a passport to be issued in the Irish language form of his name.  Before dealing with the specific request, it might be helpful if I were to outline the legislative position in this regard.  Incidentally, proficiency in the Irish language is not a requirement, a fact which I suggest Deputy Flanagan is fully aware of, having read the Act.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Use, not proficiency.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Section 10 of the Passports Act provides, inter alia, that a passport “shall be in the name of the applicant as it appears on his or her certificate of birth (whether in the English language or the Irish language)”.  There are some exceptions to the general rule, as the Deputy has pointed out.  Under section 10(2) a passport may be issued in a new name following a marriage.  That did not arise in this case.  Section 10(4) permits the issuing of a passport in a new name where an applicant provides satisfactory evidence of the use of the name over a period of at least two years prior to the application.  Where satisfactory evidence is not provided, section 10(5) permits the Minister to issue a passport in the new name.  However, in such cases, the name on the certificate of birth is entered as an observation on the passport and must remain there for at least two years.Deputy Flanagan is quite right.  The international form of passport, which is used in this and other countries, has an observation page, which is directly across from the passport entry.  Deputy Flanagan knows this and he is demonstrating this by lifting a piece of paper and showing it to the House.  That observation must remain on the passport for at least two years.  Including an observation helps to avoid difficulties which may arise, for example, where a person is applying for visas or work permits abroad.  Although inclusion is optional for applicants who provide the required two years evidence of usage, it is a requirement in the case of applicants where such evidence is not provided.  That is why the observation was entered on this man's passport in the manner it was.  This is in accordance with international passport arrangements throughout the European Union and in many other countries.In this case, the applicant provided ten documents issued to him in the Irish form of his name as evidence of usage.  He presented a driving licence which, as the Deputy has said, had been issued in December 2008.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	286	A month beforehand.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	287	That is quite correct.  There is nothing wrong with Deputy Flanagan's mathematics.  Second, he presented six receipts for dental surgery, two of which dated from as far back as 2005.  Third, he presented a letter dated 2009 from a firm of accountants and tax consultants which said he was known to them and that they had handled his business for the previous five years.  He submitted a certificate of registration of business name dated from October 2008 and a bank statement dated January 2007.Notwithstanding this, the Passport Office took the view that because much of the evidence of usage was of recent origin, in accordance with section 10(5), an observation would be entered on the passport.  A member of staff spoke to the applicant and advised him of this.  The passport was issued in the Irish form of his name but the observation showing his name at birth was entered on the page facing the data page of the passport.  This entry would be clearly visible to any person inspecting the details of the new passport.  In fact, it is regarded as a disadvantage to have such an observation on a passport because it raises questions about the passport holder.Every passport applicant has a unique holder number on the Passport Office database.  This enables the Passport Office, in examining passport applications, to track applicants' previous history.  In line with standard procedures, both Irish and English forms of this applicant's name are entered on the database under his unique holder number.I am, therefore, satisfied that the processing of this passport application complied fully with the requirements of the Passports Act 2008.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	288	In the constituency I represent, Dublin North East, recent cutbacks announced by Dublin City Manager, Mr. John Tierney, to the affordable housing and regeneration programmes will impact very seriously on people in the parishes of Darndale, Belcamp and Priorswood in Dublin 17.For over 20 years, community leaders in both areas have campaigned for the regeneration and improved re-development of their estates.  Bodies such as the Belcamp Estate Steering Committee, Moatview Fairfield Development Association, Darndale Tenants and Residents Association, Darndale Belcamp Village Centre and Northside Partnership have campaigned for the completion of the Darndale estate regeneration and for the elimination of troublesome open spaces in Belcamp and Moatview estates by the construction of affordable and senior citizen housing at those locations.The regeneration of Darndale estate, which began in the late 1980s, has greatly improved the layout and housing quality of this attractive Northside parish. The Darndale Community Development Association themselves identified the EU URBAN programme and I was delighted to strongly represent them at Dublin City Council and in Dáil Éireann to secure the funding to build the Darndale Village Centre of which we are all very proud.  The original old shops site in the centre of the estate and a small portion of the north east of Buttercup estate were promised further regeneration and development.  Following many local consultations in Darndale and discussions with Dublin City Council and with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Finneran, this final phase of Darndale's regeneration was to include new affordable housing on the old shops site and a complete redesign of the north east corner of Buttercup estate.My constituents have asked me repeatedly for the start-up date for these projects.  Recently, I was informed that these two projects will probably not proceed in 2009 and may not even start in 2010.  Darndale housing manager, Mr. John Egan, informed me recently that "there is no sign of this progressing soon.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has requested a full re-appraisal and cost plan of the proposal in view of the new economic climate."  He went on to state that even if a positive decision were made by the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, and the Minister of State, work would not commence this year.  This is appalling news for the people of Darndale and Belcamp and I am asking the Minister of State this evening to state that he is fully committed to this regeneration and that it will start in 2009.In Moatview and Belcamp estates and Priorswood parish, lengthy consultation, planning and other preparations have been made for infill affordable and senior citizen housing at a number of large urban open spaces.  This programme began around the turn of the century with the construction of about 30 new homes at a large and previously difficult open site between Moatview Drive, Moatview Avenue and Moatview Gardens.  Major preparatory works were carried out over the past three years at further large sites, including those between Moatview Close, Moatview Gardens and Belcamp Avenue and at a very difficult site between Moatview Drive, Belcamp Crescent and Belcamp Green. The major preparatory engineering works at the two sites involved massive excavations and the moving of drainage pipes and large drainage channels.  This involved great disruption at the two sites and for householders in the surrounding streets.  For the past year or more, the sites have been left almost derelict and Dublin City Council has totally failed to restore them and protect adjoining householders.It was thus very upsetting for Moatview and Belcamp residents to receive the following report about a month ago from area manager, Ms Celine Reilly.  Ms Reilly stated that "the tenders received from the Belcamp Moatview development are currently being evaluated by the City Council and when completed, the scheme will be evaluated and a decision made to either commence or postpone the development".  I was recently informed that the Moatview and Belcamp redevelopments definitely will not proceed in 2009.  This appalling news is a grave setback to Moatview and Belcamp and to the long and valiant campaign of wonderful community organisers such as the Belcamp steering committee.I call this evening for the Minister to release urgently any necessary funding to Dublin City manager, Mr. John Tierney, and for the long needed regeneration works in Darndale, Belcamp and Priorswood parishes in Dublin 17 to go ahead immediately.  Over 25 years, these valiant communities  have worked hard to redesign and to improve their estates following profound planning and design failures by Dublin City Council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It is intolerable that the completion of this long and arduous campaign should be postponed to 2010 or even later.  I call on the Minister of State this evening to take urgent action on both these projects.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I thank the Deputy for raising this important housing issue.The Government's commitment to social housing takes a broad approach to supporting the development of sustainable communities.  A crucial element of this approach is our commitment to supporting the development of sustainable communities in existing local authority estates through various improvement and regeneration initiatives.  In particular, regeneration is focused on addressing the issues of social, educational and economic disadvantage experienced in some of the most challenging areas of the country.This holistic approach looks beyond the physical infrastructure and considers all aspects of life in the areas concerned.  In addition to improving the fabric of estates, each regeneration project should take a strategic approach to addressing the underlying causes of deprivation in the area, be they a lack of educational supports, or community facilities, or issues of anti-social behaviour, and where necessary they may involve a broad range of local and national statutory agencies, as well as community and business interests.My Department supports an ambitious regeneration programme with projects ongoing in most of our cities and across a number of regional towns.  The scope of the projects involved varies significantly, depending on the size of the estates involved and the particular challenges of the areas concerned.  Regardless of scale, each project should address not just the physical improvements to the estate, but should also social inclusion.  It is a matter for the housing authority concerned to decide on the type of regeneration proposal that is most appropriate for an area and to decide on the means by which the project should be delivered.  It also falls to each individual housing authority to prioritise projects within its social housing investment programme and submit proposals in the usual way to my Department.With regard to the issue of a regeneration programme for the Belcamp and Moatview area of Dublin, my Department has not yet received a proposal on this from Dublin City Council.  From inquiries made to the council, I understand that work had been under way to develop a proposal, including the construction of affordable housing for a number of sites in this area.  However, having regard to the current economic and budgetary climate, changes in the housing market and particularly the current availability of a large number of affordable units in the general area, the council has reviewed the proposal and now considers that the provision of additional affordable units would not be feasible at this time.In so far as the regeneration of Buttercup Park in Darndale is concerned, Dublin City Council had submitted a proposal to my Department that included the construction of social housing, affordable homes and senior citizens' units.  Officials from my Department wrote to the council last January about the proposed project, particularly about the need for affordable housing in the area.  While a formal response is still awaited, I understand that the council will be submitting a revised proposal to my Department shortly.As with all social housing investment programme projects, it will be a matter for the local authority to progress this proposal in accordance with the usual conditions and, subject to approval by my Department, to manage its delivery in the context of its overall social housing investment programme and in accordance with available allocations.Finally, I would like to emphasise that my Department continues to work actively with Dublin City Council in connection with its broad range of housing programmes.  In that context, I look forward to continued engagement with the council as it develops and implements its ambitious programme of regeneration.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	290	As the House is aware, the Green Paper on Pensions was published in October 2007 and was followed by an extensive consultation process which concluded at the end of May 2008.  Almost 400 submissions were received on the range of issues presented in the Green Paper, indicating a strong desire for pension reform but there was little consensus on the type of reforms required.The Government is faced with very difficult decisions in this area and this has become even more challenging over the last number of months.  The current financial difficulties mean that many defined benefit schemes are in a deficit position and many people have seen their savings eroded.  In this context, and to follow on from measures taken in December last year, the Government has just announced plans for the introduction of a Pensions Insolvency Payment Scheme to assist workers in defined benefit schemes where the employer has become insolvent.I am aware that this is only one aspect of the many challenges facing pension provision in this country.  We are also faced with challenges in relation to pension coverage, the sustainability of our pension system generally, the adequacy of current provision and the issues raised in the Green Paper process relating to social welfare pensions.Our objective must be a pension system which will deliver an adequate retirement income for all which is, at the same time affordable and sustainable for the State, and those who sponsor and provide occupational pensions systems.The House is aware that pension reform is an extremely complex issue and the Government must ensure that it has considered all of the issues involved before making decisions which have such a strong impact on people's livelihoods.  A good, robust pensions system is costly no matter how it is organised.  The challenge faced by Government is to strike the appropriate balance between those involved, including employers, people in employment and the State.Discussions with my Government colleagues on the final framework are ongoing, and I expect that the framework will be published in the near future.

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.To qualify for payment of FIS a person must be engaged in full time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week. A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria. The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with them or is supported by them. Furthermore the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.FIS is then calculated on the basis of 60% of the difference between the income limit for the family size and the net income of the person(s) raising the children. Net income for FIS purposes comprises of total family income less tax, employee PRSI, health contribution, income levy, superannuation contribution and pension levy.Once the level of FIS payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that level for a period of 52 weeks provided that the person remains in employment. The rate of payment can be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.Current Social Welfare legislation provides that both FIS and Jobseekers Benefit cannot be paid to a person in respect of the same period. However, a person in receipt of FIS whose work pattern changes can collect Jobseekers Benefit instead of their FIS for weeks where they are out of work, if this is financially more beneficial to them. In this situation payment of FIS is suspended for the weeks where the person is not working and chooses to collect a financially more beneficial Jobseekers Benefit payment. The FIS payment resumes again for the weeks that the person is working. The person must continue to satisfy the condition of working at least 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight to avail of this arrangement.A person who works one week on and one week off, can collect FIS for the week that they are working and either Jobseekers Benefit or FIS, for the week that they are not working, whichever is the most financially beneficial. The underlying entitlement to FIS is not cancelled. Payment is suspended for the weeks that a person chooses to collect the Jobseekers Benefit payment.I do not propose to change this arrangement as it benefits the families concerned.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The Department currently delivers a service from 62 branch offices which are operated by private individuals on a contract for service basis. Branch managers are responsible for recruiting their own staff. Each branch office reports to a parent local office of the Department. The main services provided from branch offices include jobseekers payment, one-parent family payment and an information service. However, branch office managers and their staff are not appointed as deciding officers, therefore all claims taken in branch offices are forwarded to the parent local office for decision by a deciding officer.The additional number of people applying for jobseeker payments has placed increased pressure on all of the Department's offices and on branch offices. Staff in these offices are working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible.Delays in processing branch office claims do not necessarily indicate difficulties in the branch office itself, as they may be attributable to difficulties being experienced in the parent local office.Officials of the Department meet with the Branch Managers' Association on a periodic basis to discuss operational issues including staffing. At the most recent meeting held on 3 March, a number of process improvement initiatives that the Department has put in place in local and branch offices were discussed. Outline plans for further initiatives to ensure claims are processed as speedily as possible were also discussed. The branch managers were reminded that under the terms of their contract, they are required to ensure that staffing levels are adequate to allow for the efficient performance of the work of the office.The branch manager's annual performance assessment, which is undertaken by the management from the parent local office, involves an evaluation of the staffing levels to ensure that service requirements are being met. Local office management were recently reminded of their obligations in this regard.I fully appreciate that people claiming jobseekers benefit and allowance need to get access to financial and other supports as quickly as possible. Every effort is being made to ensure that applications made at Branch Offices are processed in a timely manner.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The department's facilitators work with social welfare recipients of working age in order to determine their needs and arrange through direct provision or jointly with other agencies, appropriate training and developmental programmes to equip them to progress to employment, training or further education. The current economic climate has determined that a large part of a facilitator's work at present is with people on the live register. Facilitators are located throughout the country and are assigned to cover a geographical area. For people on the live register the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) is the main welfare to work measure. Under the National Employment Action Plan customers on the Live Register are referred to FÁS as they approach 3 months with a view to assisting them enter/re-enter the labour market.The facilitator service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme. There are currently 60 facilitators in place, with a further 10 due for appointment, bringing the total in place to 70. The facilitators in each region are managed by a regional coordinator. Clerical support for facilitators is provided centrally by employment support services section.Facilitators work in co-operation with other relevant service providers such as FÁS, VECs, the Adult Education Guidance Initiative, the HSE and other local agencies. The number of facilitators in place, their workload, and the effectiveness of the service will continue to be monitored under the National Development Plan (NDP).
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can be accommodated within the social welfare pensions system, with due regard being paid to the contributory principle underlying entitlement to contributory payments and, in the case of non-contributory payments, the need to ensure that resources are directed to those who are most in need.  Over the last 10 years, means tests have been improved and qualifying conditions for contributory payments made easier.Many women in both the private and the public sectors left employment upon marriage because they were required to, or because that was the societal norm at the time.Public servants who left the workforce through the operation of the marriage bar were not insured for social welfare pension purposes. Accordingly, the loss of pension rights in their case relates more to their occupational position rather than social welfare pension entitlements.That said, the Green Paper on Pensions considered a number of issues related to the qualifying conditions for a social welfare contributory pension including the pension position of women who had to resign due to the marriage bar.  The Government is actively considering these issues and will make final decisions in the context of the long-term framework on pensions.Discussions with my Government colleagues on the final framework are ongoing, and I expect that it will be published in the near future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 21, 41, 47, 54 and 176 together.The Live Register has increased to unprecedented levels as a result of the economic downturn that the country is currently experiencing. There are currently almost 72,000 claims awaiting decisions for jobseeker's benefit and jobseekers allowance. Approximately 10,000 claims are decided upon in a given week. (See the following Table 1 for claims pending at April 09).The length of time it takes to process claims varies depending on the complexity of the claim, the availability of the necessary documentation from the applicant or his/her employer and the need to carry out additional enquires including assessment of means and whether the claimant satisfies the Habitual Residence Condition.Furthermore, processing times can vary from office to office for a number of reasons including the extent of the increased number of claims, the number of staff vacancies, the duration of such vacancies and the turnover of staff in the office which impacts on the overall level of experience in the office.During the past year an additional 190 staff have been assigned to local offices.  In addition, as many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, we have set up a number of central support units around the country.  Four such units are currently set up in Dublin, Sligo, Finglas and Carrick-on-Shannon. Each unit has 10 staff.  It is now planned to establish three further units with 10 staff each in Roscommon, Tallaght and Wexford and these units should be operational within the next few months.A further 16 Social Welfare Inspectors have been assigned to various locations throughout the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseekers allowance.It is recognised that the provision of additional staff in itself will not deal with the rising claimload.  Since early 2008 we have been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible without, of course, compromising our scheme controls.The following initiatives have been introduced at all local and branch offices.  A new streamlined process has been introduced for people who had a claim in the previous 2 years.  The application form has been simplified so that the claimant has only to provide details of circumstances that have changed since the previous claim.  A simplified procedure has been introduced for people moving to jobseekers allowance when their jobseekers benefit expires.  More straight-forward procedures have been introduced for providing evidence of identity and address.Application forms for jobseeker schemes are now available on the Department's website with comprehensive information on claiming a jobseekers payment including details of the supporting documents required.  This means that a person making a claim for jobseekers benefit or allowance can download and complete a claim form and bring it to their nearest local office.An appointment system for taking claims is in operation in the following local offices:North Cumberland Street;Ballymun;Tallaght;Thomas Street;Nutgrove;Apollo House;Bishops Square Dundalk;Waterford;Cork;Listowel;Galway;Letterkenny;Navan.There are plans to extend this system to Ballyfermot, Kilkenny and Blanchardstown over the next few weeks and it will be extended to other offices with high volumes of new claims over the coming months.In addition, a review of the processes involved in administering claims for those who are working reduced hours i.e. part-time, casual and systematic short time is underway.  The existing arrangements are very labour intensive and it is envisaged that more streamlined arrangements, which will benefit both customers and the Department, will be introduced in the near future.These improvements are part of a programme of initiatives being developed by the Department to streamline processes and procedures in local and branch offices and it is intended that further improvements will be implemented on an ongoing basis during 2009.The Deputy will be aware that anyone who is under financial pressure while awaiting a decision on their claim for a jobseekers payment can apply for Supplementary Welfare Allowance which is subject to a means test and other qualifying conditions.OFFICEParent OfficeJobseekers Allowance Claims PendingJobseekers Benefit and Credits Claims pendingTotal Claims PendingAchill SWLOAchill213Apollo House SWLOApollo House278279557Ardee SWBODrogheda199121320Arklow SWLOArklow277194471Athlone SWLOAthlone285348633Athy SWBONewbridge22697323Balbriggan SWLOBalbriggan385285670Ballina SWLOBallina287129416Ballinasloe SWBOAthlone179177356Ballinrobe SWBOLoughrea17061231Ballybofey SWBODonegal CO11932151Ballyconnell SWBOCavan176112288Ballyfermot SWLOBallyfermot382357739Ballymun SWLOBallymun197152349Ballyshannon SWBODonegal CO441761Baltinglass SWBONewbridge14232174Bandon SWBOCarrigaline241247488Bantry CO SWLOBantry CO362359Bantry SWBOBantry CO8859147Belmullet SWLOBelmullet372259Birr SWBOAthlone109115224Bishop Square SWLOBishop Square8436161,459Blanchardstown SWLOBlanchardstown1,4108892,299Boyle SWBOLongford15183234Bray SWLOBray358330688Buncrana SWLOBuncrana508234742Cahir SWBOClonmel6473137Cahirciveen SWLOCahirciveen453277Carlow SWLOCarlow367159526Carrickmacross SWBODundalk18243225Carrick-on-Shannon SWLOCarrick-on-Shannon14281223Carrick-on-Suir SWBOWaterford136101237Carrigaline SWLOCarrigaline261186447Cashel SWBOClonmel7066136Castlebar SWLOCastlebar12871199Castleblaney SWBODundalk17543218Castlepollard SWBOMullingar243119362Castlerea SWBOBallina221112333Cavan SWLOCavan7813671,148Claremorris SWBOBallina22278300Clifden SWLOClifden38947Clonakilty SWBOCarrigaline172147319Clondalkin SWLOClondalkin9241,4742,398Clones SWBODundalk572178Clonmel SWLOClonmel99118217Cobh SWLOCobh373269Coolock SWLOCoolock419353772Cork SWLOCork2,7812,8015,582Dingle SWBOTralee6582147Donegal SWBODonegal CO263864Drogheda SWLODrogheda1,2124231,635Dun Laoghaire SWLODun Laoghaire9925591,551Dundalk SWLODundalk520133653Dunfanaghy SWLODunfanaghy332760Dungarvan SWBOWaterford133107240Dungloe SWLODungloe533184Edenderry SWBOMullingar425152577Ennis SWLOEnnis446407853Enniscorthy SWBOWexford383209592Ennistymon SWBOEnnis9841139Fermoy SWBOMallow CO203248451Finglas SWLOFinglas313239552Galway SWLOGalway1,7661,5953,361Gorey SWBOWexford397187584Gort SWBOEnnis20578283Kells SWBONavan28171352Kenmare SWLOKenmare363975Kilbarrack SWLOKilbarrack311669980Kilkenny SWLOKilkenny684186870Killarney SWLOKillarney252268520Killorglin SWBOTralee120103223Killybegs SWBODonegal CO261743Kilmallock SWBONewcastlewest136182318Kilrush SWBOEnnis7276148Kinsale SWBOCarrigaline127138265Letterkenny SWLOLetterkenny18447231Limerick SWLOLimerick1,4921,7343,226Listowel SWLOListowel188272460Longford SWLOLongford6755681,243Loughrea SWLOLoughrea491171662Macroom SWBOMallow CO123283406Mallow SWBOMallow CO216330546Manorhamilton SWLOManorhamilton302050Maynooth SWBOBallyfermot1,0551,3232,378Midleton SWBOCarrigaline338496834Monaghan SWBODundalk21688304Muine Bheag SWBOCarlow17547222Mullingar SWLOMullingar5894941,083Navan Road SWLONavan Road6615171,178Navan SWLONavan9705901,560Nenagh SWBOThurles8581166New Ross SWBOWexford219114333Newbridge SWLONewbridge8745081,382Newcastle West SWLONewcastlewest119181300SWLO = Social Welfare Local Office.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The vast majority of workers pay social insurance contributions at the PRSI Class A rate. These general employees, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A. These contributions provide entitlement to a range of contingency-based payments under various social insurance schemes.Traditionally, social insurance spending has been funded on a tripartite basis — with contributions coming from the Exchequer, employers and employees. Employer contributions make up some 75% of income to the social insurance fund, with most such contributions arising from full-rate PRSI Class A. Reducing PRSI in order to support vulnerable employment would be an inefficient measure, as employments that did not require such support would also benefit, given the difficulties in targeting any reduction.The Exchequer is the residual financier of the social insurance fund and any consideration of a reduction, even on a temporary basis, in employer PRSI would have to occur in a budgetary context. Such consideration would include the effect of any such change on the financial position of the social insurance fund. The fund, having recorded a surplus of income over expenditure since 1995, recorded a deficit in 2008. A further shortfall is expected this year and although these current deficits can be met from the accumulated surplus, it is likely that the Exchequer may again have to subsidise expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund within a few years.  Given that context, a more targeted approach is required.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	297	Entitlement to State pension contributory and non-contributory is not affected by a person's residency in a nursing home.  However entitlement to household benefits, which comprise allowances for electricity or gas, telephone and free television licence, generally ceases when a person is a resident of a nursing home.  There are a number of control measures in place to ensure the discontinuance of household benefits where entitlement ceases.Data matching exercises between the Department and the various utilities identify cases for follow-up action where a change has occurred on a customer's bill, such as change of address.Reports from the General Register Office notify the Department of deceased customers.The household benefits computer system has recently been upgraded and now provides enhanced controls of claim management and processing with built-in validation and supports.For example the system does not allow duplicate awards to utility numbers (such as meter point registration numbers) for overlapping periods; following the notification of an address change to the Department, the household benefit claim is automatically stopped and an advice notification is issued to the customer's new address.Reviews are regularly undertaken in order to determine customers' continuing eligibility for household benefits. Letters issue to household benefit customers for completion and return within a specified time.  Reviews include the re-assessment of household composition, income and re-confirming customers' primary residences. Follow-up action is taken where no reply is received from the customer or where the letter is returned undelivered.   During 2008, 11,400 household benefit claims were terminated as a direct result of this ongoing review process.The Department is currently reviewing the entitlement of up to 5,000 customers whose electricity usage is low. To date, some 700 household benefit claims have been stopped as part of this control review.Control savings totalling €14.2 million was achieved under the Household Benefit scheme during 2008.  It is intended to review 17,000 cases during 2009.The Department is committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them and to ensuring that abuse of the system is prevented and dealt with effectively when detected.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 27, 34, 55, 56 and 62 together.Under the Pensions Act, defined benefit pension schemes must meet a minimum funding standard which requires that schemes maintain sufficient assets to enable them discharge accrued liabilities in the event of the scheme winding up.Where schemes do not satisfy the Funding Standard, the sponsors/trustees must submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Board to restore full funding within three years, although as part of recent temporary measures announced by the Government, the Pensions Board can now allow a scheme ten years or more to meet the standard in certain circumstances.There are currently 1,355 defined benefit schemes subject to the funding standard. It is estimated that in excess of 90% of defined benefits pension scheme are in deficit. However, the full extent of the level of under-funding will not be fully apparent until all schemes carry out their next actuarial assessment and report the results to the Pensions Board.As the Deputies are aware, the regulation of pension schemes in Ireland is provided for by the Pensions Act. In an EU context, Article 8 of Directive 80/987/EEC provides that Member States shall ensure that the necessary measures are taken to protect the interests of employees and of persons having already left the employer's undertaking or business at the date of the onset of the employer's insolvency. In its review of the transposition of that Directive, the EU Commission, at the time gave an assurance that Ireland had adequately transposed the provision in that Directive. Accordingly, the implications of the more recent ECJ judgement are being assessed to see to what impact, if any, it might have on Ireland.The Government is very conscious of the pressures on both sponsoring employers and pension scheme trustees, arising from the very significant losses incurred by pension funds over the last 18 months. We are anxious to ensure, in so far as we can, that those involved have sufficient time and space to fully assess the implications of the current difficulties for their schemes and the remedial action they can take.Indeed, this was the thinking behind the recent implementation of a number of measures to ease the pressures being felt by many pension funds. Those measures included the granting of extra time for schemes to formulate funding proposals and allowing longer periods for recovery plans.Furthermore, just this week I have introduced changes to the 1990 Pensions Act to allow for the restructuring of underfunded schemes; to ensure a more equitable distribution of assets in the event of the wind-up of a defined benefit scheme and to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board in ensuring that pension contributions deducted from wages and salaries are remitted by employers to scheme trustees.I also introduced on behalf of the Minister for Finance, the Pensions Insolvency Payments Scheme to reduce the cost of purchasing pension payments for trustees of pension schemes where the employer has become insolvent.The Government is continuing to consider a number of options in relation to the ongoing security of pensions. Any decisions in this regard will be made in the context of the National Pensions Framework which will be finalised shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The primary purpose of credited contributions is to preserve the continuity of a person's insurance record during periods when they are unable to work and pay PRSI in the normal way. In order to qualify for credited contributions, absences from work would generally have to be for reasons outside of the person's control, such as periods of proven illness or registered unemployment, or periods during which they may be entitled to certain other social welfare payments.Credited contributions are not generally available in circumstances where a person voluntarily ceases insurable employment on a temporary or permanent basis. This reflects the contributory principle that underpins the qualifying conditions for all social insurance payments. However, a person taking time off work to care for children up to 12 years of age, or an incapacitated adult, may be entitled to avail of the homemaker's scheme whereby such periods can be taken into account for state contributory pension purposes at age 66.One of the qualifying conditions for contributory pensions requires that the applicant must have a minimum yearly average number of paid or credited contributions throughout their working lives. Therefore, any prolonged gaps in insurance cover are likely to have significant consequences with regard to pension entitlement.In the case of short-term benefits such as job-seekers allowance, illness and treatment benefits a person may retain entitlement to such payments for a limited period after their last PRSI contribution but entitlement would then lapse unless further reckonable contributions are recorded on their behalf.There are no immediate plans to amend the legislation governing credited contributions for persons on a career break. However, it may be possible for a person on a career break to pay voluntary contributions, subject certain statutory conditions. In this regard it should be noted that voluntary contributions are reckonable only with regard to state contributory pension, transition pension and widows/widowers contributory pension. Obviously, depending on the nature of the career break, a person may be eligible to engage in employment or self-employment during the period of the break, thereby making social insurance contributions in the normal way.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	300	In order to incentivise 18 and 19 year old jobseekers to avail of education and training opportunities and try to prevent their becoming welfare dependent from a young age, changes are being made to the Jobseekers Allowance. The rate of Jobseekers Allowance that will be paid to new claimants under the age of 20 is being reduced from €204.30 per week to €100 per week, with effect from the first week of May 2009. This decision was made on foot of ongoing consideration of unemployment and incentives policy by Government. It is not discriminatory but rather a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency.Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment at 18 years of age, without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training, can lead to welfare dependency from an early age. If they do not improve their skills, such young persons are at risk of becoming long-term unemployed from a young age.  Therefore, it is considered necessary to provide 18 and 19 year old jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment that pays more than €100 per week.The fact that 18 and 19 year olds who participate in a FÁS or similar training/education course will get the full rate of the relevant payment (e.g. FÁS training allowance, Community Employment rate or Back to Education Allowance) instead of €100 on Jobseekers' Allowance, should also be a major incentive for such participation. Individuals will be required to access such courses if they are to receive a full rate payment. However young people with dependent children will not have their rates reduced.Primarily delivered through FÁS, there is a wide range of courses being made available to person aged 18 or 19 years and additional Post–Leaving Cert courses are being made available through Vocational Education Committees. Also, this Department has a range of education and employment supports available to people in receipt of welfare payments. The overall aim is to assist persons to return to the active labour market by enhancing their employability. This is done through the operation of programmes including the back to education and back to work allowance enterprise schemes. In addition the Activation and Family Support Programme and the Second Chance Education Opportunities Scheme offer supports to social welfare customers and other disadvantaged persons including young people aged 18 to 19 to assist them to improve their employability and personal and family situations. Schemes will continue to be monitored in light of the changing economic circumstances to ensure that they continue to meet their objectives.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The Live Register has increased to unprecedented levels as a result of the economic downturn that the country is currently experiencing. In many instances people begin queuing outside offices before they open in the mornings.These queues include people making a claim for the first time and people signing the Live Register to show that they continue to be unemployed.In order to deal with extensive queuing, we have introduced an appointment system for taking claims in offices with high volumes of claims.  Under this initiative, when a person first attends at a local office to claim, they are given details of the supporting documents required together with an appointment to attend to have the claim taken. The appointment system has been introduced in 14 local offices to date and is being extended to three other offices over the coming weeks. This initiative has been particularly effective in reducing queuing in local offices and it has also helped improve processing times where the customer provides supporting documentation at point of claim. This initiative will be extended to a number of other offices over the coming months having regard to the volume of new claims at particular offices.The signing arrangements for people who are already on the live register have been reviewed at a number of offices and additional signing days have been introduced where necessary.  In addition, at some offices specific signing times have been allocated to claimants to reduce queuing times.My Department has instituted a number of process improvement measures in order to improve the claim taking process.In addition, we are reviewing the processes involved in administering claims for those who are working reduced hours i.e. part time, casual and systematic short time. The existing arrangements are very labour intensive and it is envisaged that more streamlined arrangements which will benefit both customers and the Department will be introduced in the near future.These improvements are part of a programme of streamlining initiatives being developed by the Department and it is intended that further improvements will be introduced on an on-going basis during 2009.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	302	The purpose of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is to provide assistance to an eligible person whose means are insufficient to meet his/her basic needs and those of his/her dependants. Support available under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme includes a basic weekly allowance, supplements in respect of rent, mortgage interest, diet or heating and exceptional/urgent needs payments.An individual making an application for supplementary welfare allowance who has recently become unemployed may have maintenance liabilities which they would have been in a position to meet while in employment. If the level of maintenance payments is now such that an individual finds they have inadequate funds with which to meet their basic needs the most appropriate course of action would be for the individual to seek to renegotiate their maintenance liabilities to take account of their current financial circumstances.Where maintenance orders have been made through the courts, either parent can at a later date apply to the court for the issue of a summons against the other party for the purpose of obtaining a ‘Variation Order' to have the amount of maintenance varied. Information and advice on free legal aid for the purpose of applying to the court for a maintenance order or a variation of a maintenance order or responding to a maintenance summons can be obtained by contacting the local Citizen's Information Centre or nearest law centre.In instances where welfare support is provided to single parents in the form of one-parent family payment, the other parent (liable relative) is legally required to contribute to the cost of this payment. Liable relatives who earn less than €18,000 per annum or whose main source of income is a social welfare payment are not deemed by the Department to be in a financial position to meet weekly maintenance payments and accordingly are not assessed with a maintenance liability.Where welfare support is provided to single parents in the form of one-parent family payment and/or under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and the amount of maintenance in payment has been reduced by court order or for any other reason, it is open to that person to contact the Department or the relevant Community Welfare Officer to seek a reassessment of their entitlements to take account of the change in their financial circumstances.

A fundamental qualifying condition for both the Jobseekers Benefit and Jobseekers Allowance is that a person must be available for full-time work.When determining the classification of casual and short time workers each case must be examined on its own merits and, because of the variables necessarily involved in making a determination as to entitlement, payment rates and extent of entitlement are very much individual-specific.Employment on a casual basis implies that the number of days worked will vary each week with the amount of work available. There will be no established pattern of days. This variety will also be reflected in the wages paid. Variations in hours or days worked must be due to the employer's requirements, as opposed to a work pattern chosen by the employee. In addition, there must be no guaranteed minimum hours or wages each week.Short-time employment means employment in which, for the time being, a number of days is systematically worked in a working week which is less than the number of days which is normal in a working week in the employment concerned. Short- time work must be systematic, i.e., there must be a clear repetitive pattern of employment each week. The person must also work at least one day in each week that s/he would normally be working.In the context of changing economic circumstances there are an increased number of people claiming Jobseekers Benefit and Assistance categorised as both systematic short-time and casual employees.The application of the jobseekers payment scheme conditions to workers who are not employed on a full-time basis is being kept under review.

Each claimant is advised of the range of employment support services operated by the department and of relevant services provided by other agencies.  Claimants are also advised that there are facilitators available who can help them to explore the range of work and educational options available from the department and other agencies.The department's facilitator network works with social welfare recipients to identify appropriate training or development programmes which will enhance the skills that individuals have and ultimately improve their employment chances as well as help them continue to develop personally.  Facilitators are working closely with FÁS and other agencies at national and local level to identify appropriate education, training and development opportunities.The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) operated jointly with FÁS is the main activation measure for jobseekers.   Under the Plan, all persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register are identified by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to assisting them enter/re-enter the labour market.  FÁS will also provide a range of certified, short, flexible, modular programmes designed to upskill redundant workers so that they can enhance their prospect of securing employment.  The frequency and range of programmes in place will be expanded over the coming months.The department has been engaged in customer profiling with the ESRI, the objective of which is to identify metrics other than duration of unemployment to target additional supports for people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed and to do so much earlier than is possible at the moment.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Full social insurance cover was extended to part-time workers from April 1991. At that time a range of measures were introduced to ensure that the rate of Jobseekers Benefit payable would be proportionate to the person's income and PRSI contributions. They were also intended to ensure that disincentives to employment were not created. In the absence of these measures, a situation would exist whereby many workers on low incomes would have access to weekly social welfare payments in excess of their income from employment.These measures are regularly updated to keep pace with rises in benefit levels. Budget 2003 sought to bring the income threshold and banding structure back into line with the level of benefits payable. However, with the increases in benefits that have been provided since then, these thresholds and related bands had again gone seriously out of line with the associated rates of benefit. For example, an employee who earned €150.00 per week in 2004 qualified for a personal rate of payment of €134.80. In 2008, this payment had increased to €197.80 for the same level of earnings. At these levels, the weekly income threshold and graduated Jobseeker's Benefit rates represented a serious disincentive to employment.The new thresholds that were introduced in January will address these disincentive effects by completing the process of bringing the income thresholds and banding structure back into line with the benefits payable. A reduced rate of Jobseeker's Benefit is now payable if average weekly earnings in the Relevant Tax Year (RTY) before unemployment were under €300.Average weekly earning is total earnings from employment divided by the number qualifying contributions in the RTY. The RTY is 2 years before the year of claim, so if a claim for Jobseeker's Benefit is made in 2009 the Relevant Tax Year is 2007.A person in receipt of a reduced rate Jobseeker's Benefit payment which is insufficient to meet their needs, may be eligible for a top-up under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, subject to a means test. Recipients of Jobseeker's Benefit may also opt to transfer to means tested Jobseeker's Allowance.

The operational arrangements for processing of applications and payment to qualifying individuals, is a matter for the respective community welfare division areas.The issue of increased demand on existing resources is a matter for the HSE in the first instance to prioritise workloads and re-deploy resources where necessary so that frontline services are maintained. The HSE is reviewing the allocation of staff currently engaged in the delivery of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and associated income support payments and looking at current work practices with a view to developing proposals that would reconfigure the current service delivery model.  The community welfare service has one agreed national training programme for staff to ensure uniformity and co-ordination in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and associated income support payments across divisional areas.The question of any increase in expenditure for staffing within the community welfare service above that currently provided would have to be considered in the context of overall Government policy on public service manpower levels.Extra staff have been assigned to the department's social welfare local offices and process improvement initiatives are being implemented with a view to reducing processing times for jobseekers claims.  These measures are helping to relieve some of the pressure on the Community Welfare Service.

Such payments are confined to occurrences which the Executive considers to be unexpected, unforeseen or exceptional.Over €7m was paid in rent deposits in 2008. In general, such payments are made to the tenant and only paid occasionally to the landlord where the tenant requests that the payment be made direct to the landlord.If the landlord or tenant terminates the tenancy the tenant can use the returned deposit to secure a new tenancy. If a tenant has a legitimate grievance in relation to the refund of a rent deposit which they have paid to their landlord, they may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process.Every effort is made to ensure that payment of rent deposit is only made once in an individual case by checking computer systems to identify if any previous deposit had been paid. In general multiple rent deposits are not paid to the same person. In these circumstances, there is no evidence to indicate that €7m was lost in rent deposits in 2008.Community welfare officers have discretion to make a repeat payment of rent deposit in instances of potential homelessness.

The full adult rate of the relevant payment will be paid to 18 and 19 year olds who participate in full time approved education or training programmes.  This measure will provide this group with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.The Government is now providing, through FÁS a total of 128,000 training and activation places for the unemployed this year.  This is a substantial increase on the approximate 66,000 places taken up last year.  Also Job Search/National Employment Action Plan referral capacity has nearly doubled for 2009 from 6,500 cases per month to 12,250.  This represents an unprecedented increase in capacity for this programme, which is being undertaken by FÁS in co-operation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  In addition there are 146,700 places available in further education programmes in 2009.  This demonstrates the scale of activity being supported by this Government to ensure that people are best positioned to get back into employment.The recent supplementary budget outlined a joint approach to activation agreed between the departments of Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise Trade & Employment and Education & Science.  A range of additional measures were outlined aimed at maintaining people in employment, re-skilling and facilitating better access to allowances while avoiding undue negative impacts on vulnerable individuals.As part of the budget I introduced a package of measures relating to the back to work enterprise allowance and back to education allowance schemes to facilitate better access to supports.  The package put together by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade & Employment and Education & Science has some 11 proposals to provide 23,435 extra employment and training scheme places.The impact of the change to the jobseekers allowance payment to 18 and 19 year olds and the uptake by this age group of the available education and training opportunities will be kept under review by my department and the other departments involved.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	309	The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the rate of contribution payable.  Self-employed people are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P.  This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers.  Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context.  Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.  Self-employed workers who do not qualify for an insurance-based benefit may establish entitlement to assistance-based payments such as Jobseekers Allowance by satisfying certain conditions including a means test.Self-employed people can apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  Their means would be taken as any net profit that they will earn in the coming 12 months.  While their income from the previous 12 months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year.  Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	310	The social security rights of people living and working in the EU are governed by EU Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72.  The regulations coordinated social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.The regulations are also intended to guarantee, within the Community, equality of treatment under various national legislation to workers living in the Member States and their dependants and survivors.  Accordingly, persons residing in the territory of a Member State to whom the regulation applies are subject to the same obligations and enjoy the same benefits under the legislation of a Member State as the nationals of that State.Generally speaking, the country of employment is the competent State for the payment of family benefits.  Accordingly, the growth in the number of migrant workers in Ireland has meant a very significant increase in the amount of child benefit payments being exported to other EU countries — though the numbers involved are relatively very small. Indeed, less than 1% of overall child benefit payments made by my Department are in respect of children living abroad.  All Member States of the EU are obliged to implement these arrangements and Ireland is therefore not alone in making child benefit payments for non-resident children.Freedom of movement for workers and equality of treatment with nationals of the host country, are fundamental principles of the EU. The social security regulations are designed to support these principles.  I am also conscious of the very significant contribution migrant workers have made to the growth and development of our economy over the last decade.  The Government believes that, on balance, the Irish people have benefited from the EU principles of freedom of movement and equality of treatment with nationals of the host country.

A further two executive officers involved in fraud investigation have been assigned to means assessment.While these were full-time reassignments, they were only for short periods.  Most of these officers involved have reverted to their normal roles.  A further four staff (2 executive officers, 1 staff officer and 1 clerical officer) have been partially redeployed from Control work to claims processing.  Approximately two thirds of their time is now devoted to claims processing with one-third for Control activity.The management of resources, including the assignment of staff is a matter for each Regional Manager at any given time, having regard to the volumes of claims to be processed in their region.  These reassignments were required to deal with backlogs arising on the jobseekers allowance scheme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 43, 53, 58 and 64 together.The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  There are currently almost 85,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 42% since the end of December 2007.  It is essential that state support for tenants does not give rise to inflated rental prices and overcharging by landlords.The recent supplementary budget provided that payments currently being made to existing rent supplement tenants be reduced by 8% with effect from 1 June 2009 in the expectation that landlords will reduce their rents, given the reductions in rent levels in the private rental market as a whole.  While tenants may be contractually obliged to pay the rent agreed to in their lease, it is expected that landlords will decrease the rent in recognition of the fact that rents have fallen generally and that there are now a large number of vacant rental properties nationally.Other changes in the supplementary budget provide for new maximum rent limits to be prescribed in regulations to take effect from 1 June 2009 to reflect the general reductions in private sector rent levels as well as an increase of €6 in the minimum contribution towards rent and mortgage interest supplement to €24 a week.  This increased contribution aligns the contribution made under this scheme more closely with the rents paid by local authority tenants and should facilitate a smoother transition to the RAS.  The new maximum rent limits re regulations will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.Data published by the CSO shows that rents fell by almost 7% between November 2008 and February 2009.  A leading property website reports that rents have fallen by around 12% in the last year.  A similar trend is apparent in tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Existing recipients of rent supplement will be advised by letter in advance of the change being made to their rent payment and this communication can be shown to landlords as evidence of the revised rent supplement in payment in individual cases.  Landlords will be advised through advertising in the print media of the general reduction in rent supplement payments.Community Welfare Officers have discretion to provide assistance where exceptional circumstances exist in any individual case e.g. where homelessness might result due to the inability of a person to meet their rent payment.

It was introduced in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the ten new EU Member States, without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States.  The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere would not normally be entitled to social assistance or child benefit payments on arrival in Ireland.At present, the habitual residence condition central unit is staffed by nine staff.  The unit deals with habitual residence condition decisions in respect of certain Jobseekers Allowance and One-Parent Family claims.  Habitual residence condition decisions for child benefit, disability allowance, carers allowance and pensions are now made in their respective headquarter offices.  To further expedite the decision-making process, the responsibility for deciding the habitual residence component of those social assistance claims processed by local offices is being devolved to the recently established Local Office Support Unit.Formal training for the staff involved is due to commence in May 2009 and this will cover the Support Units in Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Finglas and Townsend Street. In Dublin.  The training of the remaining support units will be scheduled as these units become fully operational in processing claims for job seeker payments.  The localisations of the decision making functions when completed will result in speedier processing of claims involving decisions on habitual residence.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" included a commitment to study the extent and degree to which children undertake inappropriate care roles and the impact this has on their lives.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) has the lead role in relation to this study.  Officials from my Department participated with the OMCYA and the Department of Health and Children in developing the structure of the study and in the tendering process.  The study commenced in October 2008 and it is expected that it will be completed by the end of this year. The Department received a copy of the interim report on the study, Research on Young Carers in the Irish Population, in February 2009 for information.  There are no plans to reconsider the decision not to publish a National Carer's Strategy at this time.During 2008 an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process to develop a National Carers' Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time lines which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy. This position remains unchanged.The Government is acutely aware of the sacrifices made by carers and has sought to make many improvements in services and supports for carers.  Over the past decade, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit, half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple.  This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel, household benefits package.  These levels surpass the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure that those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.  In June 2006, the number of hours for which a person can engage in employment, self-employment, education or training and still be considered to be providing full time care for the purposes of carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from ten to 15 hours per week.In budget 2009, I increased the rate of carer's allowance for those aged 66 or over by €7 to €239 per week and for those aged under 66 by €6.50 to €220.50 per week.  These increases took effect from January 2009.  Recipients of carer's allowance are also eligible for household benefits and free travel and the respite care grant.  It is estimated that the combined expenditure on carer's allowance, carer's benefit, the respite care grant and half-rate carer's allowance will be €650 million in 2009.  The Department of Social and Family Affairs is committed to continuing to work with the carer representative groups to deliver services in the most effective way and to support the carer groups in the valuable work they do in helping carers.

The scheme provides a short-term "safety net" within the overall social welfare scheme to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.  A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.  There are currently over 11,300 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of almost 7,000 (175%) over the number in payment at end 2007.The assessment for the existing mortgage interest supplement scheme provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase. Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.In view of the current economic environment, the Department is conducting a review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence.  Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, including the cap on hours of employment, are also being examined.The views of the community welfare service and other interested parties are currently being canvassed as part of the review.  In the interim, updated guidelines on the operation of the existing mortgage interest supplement scheme will issue shortly to community welfare service staff.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 65 together.Under the PRSI system social insurance contributions are compulsorily payable by employers and employed and self-employed workers.  Approximately 76% of workers pay PRSI Class A and Class H at the rate of 4% and accrue entitlement to a range of benefits and pensions under various social insurance schemes.The PRSI ceiling for ordinary employees is one of a range of balancing measures between the two fundamental principles on which the PRSI system is based: the contributory principle whereby there is a direct link between contribution paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions which are payable as a right, if and when particular contingencies arise; the solidarity principle whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations.The retention of the PRSI ceiling ensures that those on higher incomes will support contributors who are more vulnerable but also provides that high income earners will achieve good value for their contributions in line with the contributory principle.  The PRSI system is strongly redistributive and the increase in the ceiling in the supplementary budget 2009 further strengthens this whilst still ensuring that higher income earners continue to gain value for their contributions.It may be noted that the "Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, 2005" report, published in 2007, found that paying social insurance contributions represents very good value for money in almost all circumstances.  In particular, the report found that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes, with persons earning less than the gross average industrial wage paying 35% of the contributions but receiving 66% of the benefits.  Additionally, it is not expected that the Social Insurance Fund will require Exchequer funding in 2009.  It is also estimated that the raising of the ceiling will yield an additional €69 million in contribution income in 2009.

This change will not apply to 18 and 19 year old recipients of jobseekers benefit.  Nor will it apply to those receiving an increase in their payment for dependent adults or children.As savings had to be achieved to keep the welfare budget at a level the State could afford, the Christmas Bonus will not be paid this year.  The alternative to this measure was to reduce social welfare rates across the board.  A number of changes are also being made to rent supplement as follows: entry to rent supplement will be restricted to applicants who have been existing tenants for six months or who have been placed on a local authority housing list following a full assessment of their housing needs; the minimum contribution for rent and mortgage interest supplement will be increased by €6 per week to €24, and maximum rent limits will be reduced as appropriate by up to 10% for all new tenancies or renewals while all existing rent supplements will be reduced by 8%.

The NEAP is not confined to particular geographic areas.The back to education allowance is designed to facilitate people of working age on welfare payments to return to education in order to gain qualifications which will help to enhance their employment prospects.  The main incentives for jobseekers to avail of the scheme are that it exempts them from the requirement to be available for work while participating in an approved course and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.  Participants may continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they have been entitled.In general, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for six months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.  Provision was made in the recent supplementary budget to allow access to the allowance at three months to pursue courses at second level.  However, a person who is entitled to statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing the first year of an approved course of study.  Each claimant for a jobseeker's payment is given an information sheet when they make their claim that, among other things, lists the range of employment support services operated by the department, this includes the back to education allowance scheme.  The relevant information and booklets are also available in each of the department's local offices.Jobseekers claimants are also advised about the department's facilitator service which is available to help a claimant to explore the range of work and educational options available.  Where a person avails of this service and participation in the back to education scheme is recommended by the facilitator, the qualifying period for the third level option is reduced from 12 to nine months.  In addition where a FÁS Employment Officer recommends participation in the back to education allowance Jobseekers claimants are also advised about the department's facilitator service which is available to help a claimant to explore the range of work and educational options available.  Where a person avails of this service and participation in the back to education scheme is recommended by the facilitator, the qualifying period for the third level option is reduced from 12 to nine months.  In addition where a FÁS Employment Officer recommends participation in the back to education allowance scheme under the NEAP the qualifying period for access to the third level option is also reduced from 12 months to nine months.Over the summer the Department intends contacting all persons under 25 who are more than three months on the live register to advise them of the back to education options and sources of information available.  The Government has devoted significant resources to the back to education allowance over the years.  In view of its important role in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers, the department continues to promote the scheme through all the channels at its disposal.

The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (Hyland v Minister for Social Welfare, 1989) led to the change in the treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.  The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.  The income tax arrangements for cohabiting couples are a matter for the Minister for Finance.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	322	There is no provision in Social Welfare legislation for a person who is living abroad to claim a jobseeker's payment in this country.  In order to qualify for a jobseeker's payment a person must be: resident in the State, under age 66, capable of work, available for work, and genuinely seeking work.To qualify for jobseekers benefit a person must also satisfy certain contribution conditions.  To qualify for jobseekers allowance a person must satisfy a means test, and the habitual residence condition.Under EU regulations, a person who has been receiving jobseeker's benefit in Ireland for more than four weeks may transfer their benefit to another EU country for up to three months while looking for work in that country.  When a claim is transferred to another EU country, the competent authority in that country takes over responsibility for the payment which is subsequently reimbursed to that country by the Department.  While claiming under EU regulations the person becomes subject to the normal controls that pertain in the other EU country.  Jobseeker's allowance is not transferable to another EU country.There are no statistics maintained in the Department of fraud perpetrated in other EU member states by persons who have transferred jobseekers benefit abroad under EU Regulations.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	323	Applications for means tested payments are investigated by staff in the Department.  In the ordinary course of events, a means assessment involves an interview of a claimant by a Social Welfare Inspector, in which they will be asked, inter alia, for details of any bank accounts they hold. Where an applicant states he or she has one or more bank accounts, there are two possible courses of action open to the inspector; one is to request the applicant to provide copies of the relevant bank statements, the other is to ask the applicant to sign an authorisation permitting the bank concerned to provide the information required directly to the investigating officer. The first option, while it will provide accurate details of any accounts disclosed, will not provide any guarantee that the account(s) disclosed represent all of an applicants' accounts.  Nonetheless, in many instances this option is used by an inspector.There are, however times when an inspector will require further information or may need to establish from the bank that they have details of all accounts held in the person's name.  In these circumstances, the inspector will ask the customer to sign a form of authorisation as described above.  An inspector will always get the authority of the customer before making any inquiry of a bank.

The Department has already set an ambitious target for control savings this year of over €580 million and it would not be possible to secure further savings of the magnitude required to meet the cost of a Christmas bonus.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Estimates for the Department of Social and Family Affairs which were published on 23 April last were based on an up to date analysis of trends as regards likely numbers of recipients and average value of payments in 2009.  The estimates for jobseekers benefit, jobseekers allowance and supplementary welfare allowance were significantly increased from the Estimates published at the time of the October budget.  These estimates were increased in line with the Department of Finance's projections of an average live register of 440,000 for the year.  The amounts provided were not derived from a budgetary target.There is no question of any overzealous application of qualification guidelines to achieve target expenditure outcomes.  Expenditure on Social Welfare schemes is driven by a range of economic, social and demographic factors and it has long been accepted that expenditure on these schemes is demand lead.  A person's entitlement to any given social welfare payment is assessed in accordance with predetermined qualifying conditions and rates of payment which are laid down in legislation or published guidelines.  There are also well established appeal procedures for those who are unhappy with the decisions made on their claims for a social welfare payment.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 53 independent MABS companies with voluntary boards of management operating the local services throughout the country.  In addition, the MABS National Telephone Helpline is available from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday to Friday, at lo-call number 1890 283 438 and budgeting and money management information can be accessed 24 hours a day at www.mabs.ie.  The MABS advises that people coping with debt difficulties should make an approach to the MABS, via any of the channels.  This can be the first positive step in addressing debt difficulties. In 2009, almost €18 million has been provided to fund the service.  The additional investment in the MABS in recent years has strengthened the capacity of the service to deal with increased demand for service.  There are now 252 money advice staff employed throughout the country and the Telephone Helpline has been strengthened to provide an immediate response to clients seeking information and advice.  Applications for extra resources from individual MABS companies are subject to funding being made available and are kept under review.All MABS companies operate an appointments system for meeting clients.  Clients with urgent difficulties are prioritised for attention and dealt with promptly.  Less urgent cases are referred to the Telephone Helpline and to the website for immediate assistance with budgeting and money management issues.  Information is not collected centrally on the waiting times for appointments at different offices.  However, I have been advised that the waiting period for less urgent cases ranges from a maximum of approximately eight weeks to as short a period as one week depending on the local service.  Local services monitor their waiting times for appointments and, where required, seek guidance in managing their caseload from MABS NDL, the national support company.The Telephone Helpline assists local services manage their appointment lists by providing an initial preliminary MABS service to clients and ongoing support while they await their appointment with their local money adviser.  The Telephone Helpline can handle less complex straight forward single debt cases such as threatened utility disconnections and deals directly with the ESB and An Bord Gáis in relation to these cases.  Over 90% of callers to the Helpline find that their money management and budgeting issues can be resolved with the assistance of the helpline advisor.MABS NDL has introduced a number of community education and other initiatives to further assist the local services with their increased caseloads.  These include a money management education programme for people facing redundancy to inform them about managing on a reduced income and how to avoid getting into debt.

Those who do not qualify for jobseekers benefit which is based on PRSI contributions may qualify for jobseekers allowance provided they satisfy the normal conditions which include a means test.Generally, self-employed persons are assessed on the basis of their income in the past 12 months to determine their expected income in the following year.  If a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this is factored into the assessment of future income.  It is recognised that the present downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.  The Social Welfare Inspectors take account of this fact in projecting future earnings.While additional staff have been allocated to Local Offices to deal with the increasing live register, other initiatives have also been put in place to speed up the taking and processing of claims. This includes the setting up of regional support units in Sligo, Carrick-on-Shannon, Finglas, and Townsend St. in Dublin.  These improvements are part of a programme of initiatives being developed by the Department to streamline processes and procedures in Local and Branch Offices and it is intended that further improvements will be introduced on an on-going basis during 2009.

Subject to certain eligibility criteria new and developing enterprises may qualify for financial support from the CEBs in the form of feasibility, employment and capital grants.  In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow. All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.However, I would stress that priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc), construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.Enterprise Ireland provides funding and expertise to companies with ten or more employees in the indigenous manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors who wish to expand through increased export activity.Anyone with a business idea would be best advised to contact their local CEB in the first instance to discuss the matter further. Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website; www.enterpriseboards.ie.

A person who ceases to hold office in order to take up a position to which he or she is appointed by the Government or for which he or she is nominated by the Government is not entitled to severance.Severance is paid for a maximum of two years or for a period equivalent to that for which the person held office, if this is a lesser period.  The severance is paid at a rate of 75% of the Officeholder's salary during the first six months, 50% of the salary during the next twelve months and 25% of salary during the last six months.  A person who is entitled to receive an Officeholder's pension may switch to that pension at any time, but pension and severance are not payable during the same period.

Due to the extreme urgency of this work, and in accordance with Public Procurement Guidelines, the contractual terms were negotiated with the company without advertising the contract.The work undertaken involved an initial high level assessment of the capital and liquidity levels of the institutions, stress testing of the institutions' loan portfolios over a three year period, and reviewing the valuation of properties held as collateral against the main property loans.The total fees paid by the Financial Regulator to the company in respect of the work was €3.8 million, which has been completed.  These costs will ultimately be charged by the Financial Regulator directly to the relevant institutions.Further to a request of the Department of Finance under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008, the Financial Regulator has asked the company referred to, building on its previous work, to carry out further analysis of certain specified covered institutions.  This work is ongoing and the same contractual arrangements will apply.I understand that the company concerned has also carried out work to assist the National Pension Reserve Fund Commission's due diligence examination of AIB and Bank of Ireland.  The NPRFC is an independent body and I cannot comment on the terms of this contract.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The Deputy's question refers to the redemption fee applied by mortgage providers in circumstances that a customer seeks to break a fixed rate mortgage. Mortgage lenders in Ireland generally seek to recover costs of funds when a borrower with a fixed rate mortgage agreement seeks to terminate the agreement some time before the term agreed.Traditionally redemption fees were articulated with the institution specifying that a given number of months interest would apply. Overtime, they have generally moved towards a mechanism which reflects the difference between the contracted rate and current market rates applied to the amount outstanding for the remaining fixed period. Where a redemption fee is payable on a housing loan the mortgage agent has to inform the consumer about it at the outset.Compensation sought by the lender reflects the cost to the institution of obtaining the funds on the capital market at a certain cost, as against selling them on at a related price. Institutions fund the fixed rate agreement through funding on markets, generally through interest rate swaps. This allows them to hedge their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Where the borrower seeks to repay the loan before the contractually agreed fixed term in an environment where interest rates have declined, the institution is exposed to re-investment risk, i.e., it will be unable to re-lend the funds at a rate related to their cost, due to intervening market fluctuations.Ireland is relatively unusual in the EU context in that borrowers have an absolute legal right to repay their loan early as set out in Section 121(1) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995. However Section 121 goes on to recognise that while a consumer will not be liable to pay an early redemption fee with respect to a variable rate loan, this exemption from redemption fees does not apply where the rate of interest is fixed or is fixed for one year.The Deputy may wish to note that as part of the preparations for the EU White Paper on Mortgage Market Integration, which was published in December 2007, the Mortgage Industry and Consumer Expert Group agreed that lenders should receive a compensation when a consumer repays his or her fixed rate loan earlier than at its contractual termination.There are significant benefits for both individual householders and for the stability of the housing and financial sector overall from greater take-up of fixed rate mortgages and it would not be advisable to embark on any course of action which could impact adversely on the cost and availability of fixed rate mortgages in the future.On 26 March 2009, I undertook, in this House, to contact the Consumer Director of the Financial Regulator on the subject of customers who wish to switch from a fixed rate mortgage. On foot of that my Department has contacted the Financial Regulator to request confirmation that the redemption costs for switching from a fixed rate mortgage cover funding costs only and that there are no other costs included in these charges. The Financial Regulator has confirmed to my Department that it is looking into this matter and that it will revert shortly. I will advise the Deputy of the outcome of the Financial Regulator's consideration of this matter.

This would include knowing, for example, if the person or their spouse had turned 65 in the tax year, if they had other income sources and the aggregate income from these sources, if there had been a change in employment circumstances or if there had been a change in marital status during the year.Revenue would not be in a position to establish many of these matters until after the end of a tax year and hence the need for the legislation to provide for the exemption to apply on the basis of a person making a repayment claim after the end of the tax year. I understand that in the case of the personal exemption of €20,000, the Revenue Commissioners have, on an administrative basis, advised employers and pension providers that they may apply the personal exemption of €20,000 during the course of the year for those persons aged 65 years and over, irrespective of marital status, where it is clear that the person's income for the year from that employment or pension will not exceed €20,000.  Where it emerges after the end of the year that this arrangement results in an underpayment of the levy Revenue will pursue recovery of the levy underpaid.

Under these provisions, people who are insured with (covered by) the health care system of one EU member state are entitled to receive health care in the public system of another member state in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured.Ireland operates a bilateral health care reimbursement agreement with the United Kingdom, arising from the application of Regulation (EC) 1408/71. The agreement comprehends such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries; pensioners of one country residing in the other country and their dependants; and the dependants residing in one country of people who are employed in the other country. The amount due is the net difference between the costs to the Irish health services of providing care to those with UK entitlements and the cost to the UK health services of providing services to those with Irish entitlements. Allowance is also made for those with dual entitlements in both jurisdictions. Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.The payment made in any one year is based upon an estimate of the number of persons falling within categories eligible for reimbursement and for whom each country is liable and an estimate of the average cost of providing health care treatment. Payments are made in advance with final settlements made once all necessary information is complete. Total payments in any one year can relate to both final settlements in respect of previous years' liabilities and advance payments in respect of the current year. The net payment received from the UK over the last three years was: 2006 — €397m; 2007 — €450m; 2008 — €100m. These amounts represent the actual payments made in cash in these years and do not correspond to the full liability for that particular year. In line with established practice, advances are subject to final settlement once all necessary information is complete, including the approval of average costs figures for both countries at EU level.Due to the nature of the claims process and the fact that bilateral discussions are continuing, it is not possible to establish whether any previous payments the UK has made represent overpayments in advance of the finalisation of accounts for these years. By far the largest part of the payment received from the UK authorities on an annual basis relates to the provision of health care to UK pensioners and their dependants residing in Ireland. The estimated number of pensioners for whom each country is liable is based on a survey by both administrations undertaken every three years. Such a survey was completed in 2008 and, in line with the agreement, will be applied to determine the liabilities for that year and retrospectively 2007. Discussions between my Department and the UK on the application of the survey and other aspects of the implementation of the agreement are continuing. The 2008 survey does indicate a reduction over previous surveys in the number of pensioners for which the UK is liable. This is in line with trends in demography and patterns of migration between the two countries.While discussion of the detailed application of the survey is continuing, the reduction indicated in the survey will lead to an offsetting reduction in respect of the UK's estimated liability for 2007. The likelihood of such a reduced liability in respect of 2007 and subsequent years was considered in agreeing the 2008 payment of €100m set out above. The emerging reduction in ongoing liability of the UK also informed the estimation of the potential income from the UK authorities this year of €250m which is incorporated in the Revised Estimates Volume. As indicated, in line with established practice, the UK's final liability for 2007 will be determined once all necessary information is complete, including the approval of average costs figures for both countries at EU level.

The Health Service Executive can pay an approved subvention to the nursing home of the applicants' choice and the payment of the balance of the nursing home fee is a matter between the patient and the nursing home under the contract of care agreed between these parties. In order to qualify for a subvention, an individual must be:(a) sufficiently dependent to require maintenance in a nursing home, and(b) unable to pay any or part of the cost of maintenance in the home. In order to determine this, they must undergo a means assessment which takes account of their income and assets.The existing subvention scheme is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) (Amendment) Act 2007. Under the Act, the maximum amount for basic subvention is €300 per week. The Act also provides for an enhanced subvention to be paid. However, there is no maximum amount set for enhanced subvention. The amount paid is at the discretion of the HSE and will vary depending on the following criteria:the assessed means of the applicant,the cost of care in the individual case compared to the level of fees in the locality,the amount of basic subvention payable,the amount of resources available for the scheme,the need for the HSE to ensure that the available resources are distributed in a way that supports applicants as evenly as  possible across the country.Medical card holders are entitled to retain their medical card when they move into a private nursing home.  In such circumstances, the HSE must continue to make a General Practitioner (GP) service available to the patient free of charge and they retain the right to choose their own GP in the same way as if they were living in the community.Finally, the Minister has acknowledged that the current system of Nursing Home Subvention does not provide adequate supports for some people. It was with this in mind that work commenced on the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal. You will be aware that the legislation completed Committee Stage in the Dáil on 12 March 2009. It is the Minister's intention to progress the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas with a view to implementing the scheme later this year. Unfortunately it is not possible to give a more specific timeframe at present.The Fair Deal is designed to remove real financial hardship from many individuals and their families who, under the current system of Nursing Home Subvention, have to sell or re-mortgage homes to pay for the cost of nursing home care. It aims to render private long-term care affordable and anxiety-free, and ensure that no-one has to sell their home during their lifetime to pay for their care. The Fair Deal will equalise State support for public and private long-term care recipients. There will be one, transparent system of support towards the cost of care that will be fair to all, irrespective of whether they are in public, private or voluntary nursing homes. This will meet one of the objectives of Towards 2016, namely that State support should be indifferent as to whether a person is in public or private care.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Preschool year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) which was announced recently by the Minister of Finance. The scheme will allow children to avail of a free playschool place in their preschool year, which will be provided for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 38 weeks. It will also allow children in their preschool year who are attending a full part-time day day care service to avail of a free session of 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 50 weeks. As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010 and children availing of the scheme in January 2010 will have a reduced period of free preschool provision. It is hoped that the majority of parents, regardless of their income levels, will avail of the scheme for a free preschool year.Participating children must normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on 1 September of each year. Exceptions will be allowed where children have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school. Participating services will receive capitation of €64.50 per week where children attend for 38 weeks, and €48.50 where they attend for 50 weeks of the year. Services will receive payments at the start of each term. Where the child is attending full-day or part-time child care, the service will be required to reduce the child care fees by the amount of the capitation. A participating service may also operate a preschool service which is not within the scheme.The scheme is expected to cost approximately €170 million per annum. This figure has been estimated on the basis that the capitation grant of over €2,400 per annum will be paid in respect of some 70,000 participating children. As parents are not required to enrol their children in the preschool year, a participation rate of 90% of eligible children has been assumed. As the age range for eligibility covers a 15 month period (i.e. children must be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months at 1 September), the participation rate of 90% takes account of the full cohort of children who could be enrolled. (The number of live births in Ireland in 2005 was 61,042, rising to 64,237 in 2006 and 70,620 in 2007.)  As the majority of children start school at the age of 5, most participating children in January 2010 are expected to be aged 4 with a significant minority aged 3. The 15 month age range is provided to facilitate parents in aligning their children's preschool year with the year they commence school.The scheme will be open to almost 5,000 private and voluntary preschool services and officials in my Office will be writing to these by the end of May 2009 to provide further details and to advise them of the application process. Preschool leaders will be expected to have a qualification in child care to FETAC level 5 or 6 qualifications, or equivalent or to be in the process of completing their qualification. All services will be required to provide an educational programme consistent with the principles of Síolta and appropriate to the age of participating children. A national team of Síolta co-ordinators will assist services in meeting these standards.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The Adoption Bill, 2009, which will give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption, was published on 23 January, 2009.A core principle of the Hague Convention is that inter-country adoption should be    child-centred — that is, in all stages of the process, the child's interests must be paramount. Legislating for inter-country adoption is essential to give protection to children during the process of adoption. The Hague Convention has put in place the equivalent of a contract between States to regulate the standards that will apply in each jurisdiction. This is an additional safeguard for a receiving country like Ireland with regards to the standards that are being applied in the sending country — over which we have no jurisdiction. As a receiving country, it is especially important for Ireland to have some confidence in the process of consent to the adoption, in the status of the child as adoptable and in a guarantee of no improper financial gain from the process.I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention provide an assurance for individual children, their families and the State that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.  As such, it is our intention that inter-country adoptions will now meet the standards of the Hague Convention. Under the proposed new legislative regime, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries that have ratified the Hague Convention as well as from those countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement based on Hague standards. As part of the preparations for the likely passage and entry into force of these new legislative arrangements, my Office has been liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs to identify and negotiate with countries that continue to seek homes abroad for children in need of alternative care that cannot be provided domestically. We are working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small number of countries, including the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Russian Federation.As regards the Russian Federation, my Office is undertaking preparatory work to consider the contents of such an agreement, including anticipating the likely requirements of the Russian Federation. While every effort will be made to conclude a bilateral agreement with countries from which children have traditionally been adopted by Irish applicants in advance of any of the proposed changes in Irish law taking effect, it must be acknowledged that these matters will be determined to a considerable degree by the Governments of these sovereign States. However, at this point in time, it is my priority to endeavour to ensure that an international bilateral agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is put in place as soon as possible to maintain the continuity of arrangements between Ireland and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in relation to inter-country adoption.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The Adoption Acts, 1952 -1998 provide the statutory framework for adoption, including intercountry adoption, in Ireland. The Adoption Act, 1952 provides for the establishment of the Adoption Board. The Adoption Board has a range of powers and functions which include:(i) powers to make adoption orders and in doing so, to determine the eligibility and suitability of applicants for adoption;(ii) to determine of the requisite consent to adoption and the validity of such consents; and(iii) to determine that the requisite administrative and procedural requirements under the Act have been met.In determining the issue of eligibility and suitability, either in relation to the making of an adoption order or the issuing of a Declaration of Eligibility or Suitability to adopt abroad, the Board has regard to assessement reports prepared by the Health Service Executive or a registered adoption society. Under section 8 of the Adoption Act, 1991 the Health Service Executive carries out assessements of eligibility and suitability for intercountry adoption or makes arrangements for such assessments to be carried out by a registered adoption society. The Adoption Act, 1952 also provides for the establishment of Register of Adoption Societies. The Adoption Board keeps this register and grants registration to those bodies competent to undertake the obligations of a registered adoption society set out in the Acts for the making of arrangments for adoption.At a practical level, the development of standards for the assessment of applicants for intercountry adoption has been advanced through the conjoint working of the Adoption Board, the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the Health Service Executive. This work was based on a Report commissioned by the Department of Health and Children and submitted to Government in June 1999 "Towards a Standardised Framework for Intercountry Adoption Assessment Procedures". The standardised framework which emerged from that process in 2000 was founded on evidence-based practice and developed with the assistance of international agencies in the field. The implementation of this framework is continually under review by all parties as intercountry adoption practice and experience continues to evolve and with particular regard to the new statutory framework likely to emerge from the recently published Adoption Bill, 2009.The Bill is aimed at copperfastening the role of a new Adoption Authority as the Central Authority under the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. This will include the strengthening of the system of accreditation for a range of agencies working in the adoption field, either assessing or assisting applicants in advancing their adoption application once they have been approved as eligible and suitable to adopt by the Adoption Authority. This will also provide for a comprehensive framework for the oversight of intercountry adoption practices across jurisdictional boundaries in conjunction with other Contracting States. The Health Information and Quality Authority has no role in setting standards for assessements under the Adoption Acts, 1952-1998.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	367	There has been a growing demand for, and investment in, physiotherapy services over the last number of years. A particular priority for my Department and the Department of Education and Science in recent years has been the expansion of the supply of therapy graduates. The Government has also invested heavily in the education and training of such personnel in order to secure a good supply of graduates to provide for the healthcare needs of the population into the future. In this regard, since 1997, the number of training places for physiotherapists has been increased from 64 to 145 which represents an increase of 127%. The numbers employed in physiotherapy has also grown significantly, with 593 whole time equivalents employed in December 1997 compared to 1,449 whole time equivalents employed in December 2008, which represents an increase of 144%.The Government is committed to ensuring continued adequate recruitment of professional staff across a range of community settings to ensure the continued development of community services. Additional funding of €20 million has been provided in 2009 for health and education services for children with special educational needs. This funding will provide a total of 125 additional therapy posts in the HSE targeted at children of school-going age. 90 of these will be in the disability services, including physiotherapists, speech and language therapists and occupational therapists.My Department recently wrote to the Health Service Executive setting out the overall approved employment control ceiling for 2009. As part of this approval, written confirmation has been provided to the HSE that the general moratorium on recruitment, promotion and the payment of acting up allowances does not apply to specific designated grades. Delegated sanction has been given to the HSE for the creation and filling of frontline posts including physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy posts. The approval indicated that vacancies in existing posts in these grades may continue to be filled. New posts may also be created in these grades, up to a specified limit, provided that the HSE is satisfied in each case that there is no scope to redeploy an equivalent post from the hospital sector to the primary and community care sector. This moratorium exemption provides for an increase in the number of therapy posts, in line with Government policy, in order to meet the requirements of integrated care delivery and primary care needs particularly in respect of children at risk, the elderly and those with disabilities. The recruitment and retention of these key front line therapy posts, including physiotherapy, is vital to ensure continued progress in the development of community settings.Subject to overall parameters set by Government, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility for determining the composition of its staffing complement. It is a matter for the Executive to manage and deploy its human resources to best meet the requirements of its Annual Service Plan for the delivery of health and personal social services to the public. As this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has responsibility for administering the health repayment scheme in conjunction with the appointed scheme administrator KPMG-McCann Fitzgerald. The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care. Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965. All applications received under the scheme are processed within this legal framework and specific details on certain cohorts of applicants, such as those outlined by the Deputy are not currently available. However, in terms of the overall scheme over 39,500 applications have been received, 7,600 of which were submitted by the HSE on behalf of patients.  Approximately 7,100 HSE claims have been concluded, 500 HSE claims remain to be concluded and approximately 1,100 HSE claims have been appealed.The procedure employed to have an offer accepted or reviewed when HSE staff make an application is in accordance with the legislative provisions of the Act.  If the applicant disagrees with the repayment amount offered an appeal is lodged under section 16 of the Act which provides for the process for those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator. When HSE staff accept an offer of repayment on behalf of a patient, the repayment is made directly to the relevant patient private property account. The Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office is an independent office established to provide an appeals service to those who wish to appeal the decision of the Scheme Administrator under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006.Up to the 24 April 2009, the Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office has received 1,552 completed appeal forms from all claimants who had received an offer from the Scheme Administrator. Decisions have been made in 764 of these appeals and 331 of these decisions have disagreed with the amounts offered by the Scheme Administrator. Up to the 24 April 2009, the Health Repayment Scheme Appeals Office has received 3,997 completed appeal forms from all claimants whose claim had been rejected by the Scheme Administrator. Decisions have been made in 2,449 of these appeals and 276 of these decisions have disagreed with the decision of the Scheme Administrator. The HSE has informed my Department that up to the 17 April 17,076 payments totalling over €376m have issued while over 20,000 offers of repayment totalling over €396m have been made. Approximately 700 claims are currently outstanding and these claims are being concluded on a daily basis.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	374	Regulation (EC) 1408/71 deals with the coordination of social security schemes, including healthcare, for those moving within the European Union. Under its provisions persons who are insured with (covered by) the healthcare system of one EU member state are entitled to receive healthcare services in the public system of another member state, in certain circumstances, at the cost of the member state in which they are insured. Such persons may include people who are employed in one member state and resident in another and their dependants, pensioners of one member state who reside in another and their dependants and visitors to one member state from another.The provisions of Regulation (EC) 1408/71 supersede national eligibility provisions. Persons residing or staying in Ireland who are covered by these provisions are entitled free of charge to all medical treatment provided by Irish legislation, where the cost of this treatment is payable by a member state other than Ireland; those residing here receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement, although this is not based on national legislation. Persons in receipt of a qualifying pension from another EU member state and who are not in receipt of a qualifying Irish pension will receive a medical card under these arrangements. There have been no changes in the entitlement of this category of insured persons.

The review will seek to identify a model of care that delivers services as near to home as possible for the vast majority of patients.The review will include full engagement and discussion with relevant healthcare providers, staff and patient representative groups and public representatives.I have asked the HSE to give the Deputy further information in relation to accident and emergency services in Cork City.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The person concerned applied for asylum in the State on 1 September 2005.  Following investigation by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, it was established that the person concerned had previously made an asylum application in the United Kingdom and, as such, a determination was made that the person concerned should be transferred to the United Kingdom for the purposes of having her asylum application examined there. This determination was upheld following an appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Consequently, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 3 November 2005. This Order was subsequently served on the person concerned which placed a legal obligation on her to present herself at the Offices of the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), on Monday 21 November 2005, to make arrangements for her formal transfer to the United Kingdom. The person concerned failed to ‘present' on this occasion and was therefore classified as having ‘evaded' her transfer.  The person concerned became illegally resident in this State at that time.The person concerned continued to evade her transfer with the consequence that the Transfer Order expired leaving Ireland responsible for processing the asylum application of the person concerned. At this point the case of the person concerned was referred back to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner for the purposes of having her asylum claims investigated. As part of this process, the person concerned was invited to attend for interview at that Office, on a designated date and time, but she failed to attend. Neither did she offer any explanation for her non-attendance. As a result, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a recommendation that the person concerned be refused a declaration of refugee status. This recommendation was conveyed in writing to the person concerned by letter dated 13 June 2007. This communication also notified the person concerned that, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13(2)(c) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), there was no appeal against this recommendation.Arising from the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 9 April 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State. In addition, she was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006). The person concerned has not yet responded to my Department's letter of 9 April 2009. However, the 15 working day period referred to does not expire until 5 May 2009.The Deputy can be assured that the case of the person concerned will not be processed further pending the expiration of the 15 working day period referred to.

The text of the legislative proposal and an information note were provided to the Oireachtas on 5 August 2008.Discussions at Council Working Group level commenced under the French Presidency on 18 July 2008 and a brief orientation debate on the proposal was held by Council on 2 October 2008. These ongoing discussions are at a very early stage and it is not yet possible to determine what a final draft will contain. Therefore, any comments made at this stage must of necessity be of a preliminary nature. The Deputy will note that Ireland has already legislated extensively in this area. The initial view of my Department is that the proposal will not require any change to the provisions of the Equal Status Acts governing access to education.

Garda Management are aided in this by a distribution model known as the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (G.E.R.M.).The Commissioner advises me that the GERM model indicates the most effective means to distribute Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making. It takes into account many different policing variables including socio-economic factors, census information, crime trends and the minimum establishment required for each district. The allocation of Garda personnel is determined by these factors and also takes account of the policing requirements of each individual Division.

Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 5 March 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post which obliges the person concerned to leave the State. To this end, the person concerned was required to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Thursday 16 April 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. The person concerned presented as required and is due to present again on Thursday 21 May 2009.I am satisfied that the applications made by the person concerned for asylum, for Subsidiary Protection and for temporary leave to remain in the State, together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

Its purpose is to advise the Minister, Minister of State and Irish Aid on development education policy. The members serve in a voluntary capacity. While I have not received reports relating to the operation of the Committee, the Chairman regularly provides advice to Ministers, including on implementation of the development education strategy of the Department.The Government Emigrant Services Advisory Committee (previously known as Díon) was set up in 1984 to advise the Government on the welfare of the Irish community in Britain. The Committee's primary role is to advise on the distribution of Government support to voluntary agencies providing front line services and community care to Irish people in Britain. The Committee is chaired by an official from our Embassy in London and its members serve in a voluntary capacity. The Committee provides ongoing advice to my Department and the Embassy reports to me on the operation of the Committee on a regular basis. In 2007, an independent Value for Money Review reported on my Department's Emigrant Services Programme, including such services provided in Britain. Copies of the Report were lodged with the Houses of the Oireachtas in August 2007.The Fulbright Commission (The Board of the Ireland — United States Commission for Educational Exchange) finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America.

The term of the last Board ended on October 31st 2008.   During its lifetime, the Advisory Board for Irish Aid (ABIA) published Annual reports which were made available to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State for Overseas Development, and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. In addition, a number of detailed analytical studies on themes relevant to development cooperation policy and the Irish Aid programme were commissioned by ABIA in the context of its research mandate.

The letter was issued on 7th April 2009.  The letter contained contact details for members of staff in my Department to enable direct enquiries to be made.The Deputy may wish to note that the Scheme is delivered by volunteers working with older people in their communities and does not provide funds for the engagement of staff.  I am aware that the suspension of the Scheme may reduce the volume of work for some operations in the installation of alarms and security devices.  However, the suspension does not affect arrangements already in place for the monitoring of alarms systems funded by the Scheme.Last week, I met with representatives of Age Action Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Muintir na Tíre, Irish Rural Link and the Senior Citizen Parliament to discuss the suspension of the scheme and the concerns about how it currently operates.  Arising from these discussions, I have agreed with these organisations a process that will set the broad parameters for a review of the scheme to be undertaken by my Department and for the necessary consultation to be undertaken as part of the review process.  I am hopeful that the review process can begin in May and be completed by mid-September.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest. The purpose of the supplement is to provide short term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence. The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.There are currently over 11,300 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of over 7,000 (175%) over those in payment at end 2007.The scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the department and delivered locally by community welfare officers. A community welfare officer interviews applicants for mortgage interest supplement when they first present in order to determine if they satisfy the statutory qualifying conditions for entitlement. They also ensure that all the documentation required to make a decision has been provided.Claim details are recorded electronically in cases where it is established that mortgage interest supplement is payable. However, claim details are not always recorded electronically where no entitlement has been established to mortgage interest supplement, unless an appeal has been lodged with an appeals officer of the HSE, in which case claim details would be recorded electronically.For this reason, reliable statistics are not available on the total number of people who applied for and were refused mortgage interest supplement.In view of the current economic environment, the Department has commenced a review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme. The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence. Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, including the cap on hours of employment, are also being examined. The review will examine operational aspects of the scheme including best practice in the recording, collating and maintenance of statistical data.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets on its schemes and services.  These are available in a wide range of outlets across the country, including all Social Welfare Local Offices and Branch Offices, Citizens Information Centres, Post Offices and in other organisations such as local community centres. Where appropriate the leaflets also contain information directing members of the public to services provided by other Government Departments and agencies such as FÁS.Information on the range of schemes and services administered by the Department is also provided on the Department's website www.welfare.ie.  This site links to other Government Departments and agencies.  The Department's Employment Action Plan (EAP) is a systematic process whereby people in receipt of Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance are referred to FÁS.  The purpose is to facilitate access to the range of employment and training services available.  The Department will continue to work with FÁS to ensure that these services are availed of to their fullest extent.The Department's information leaflets and signage or website do not refer to recruitment agencies or any other private sector organisations and there are no plans to do so.  Any initiative involving the contracting of a private sector organisation would be advertised in accordance with EU procurement guidelines.

This application is being examined and he will be notified of the outcome in due course.  The person concerned has also claimed illness benefit but has insufficient contributions paid/credited to qualify for payment.The address quoted is the only one known to the Department for this person.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Since its introduction, the underlying objective of the back to education allowance scheme has been to equip people on social welfare payments with qualifications that will enable them to obtain employment in the labour market.  It is a second chance educational opportunities scheme for people on welfare payments who wish to participate in full time education and who would not otherwise be able to do so.Improvements to the scheme were announced in the recent supplementary budget.  The qualifying period has been reduced to three months for access to the second level option. Also jobseekers who engage with the department's facilitator programme can access the third level option at nine months on the recommendation of a facilitator.In general, to qualify, an applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, lone parents and persons in receipt of jobseeker's payments can qualify at 18 years of age provided they are out of formal education for at least 2 years. In addition an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months if pursuing a second level course or 12 months if pursuing a third level course.In response to the current economic circumstances people who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.  Also as indicated earlier the qualifying period for the third level option is reduced to 9 months for persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan process or engaging with a department facilitator.The Government recognises that education has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of those on the Live Register and the qualifying conditions of the back to education scheme will continue to be monitored.

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as expeditiously as possible.  The staff and other resources available to the Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands. The available resources are then used to discharge the Department's obligations towards our claimants and in implementing cost effective controls to prevent and detect fraud and abuse.  With the increase in the number of people applying for jobseeker's payments staff in local offices have been working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible, however there are delays in some areas.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that pension claims are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible.Claims for State Pension (Contributory) are now fully processed within four weeks of receipt of application where all information is available.  Average processing times for all State Pension (Contributory) claims now stand at less than 9 weeks.  At present, 78% of State Pension Non-Contributory claims are processed and decided within 10 weeks.The Department has a process in place whereby people are proactively invited to claim State Pension Contributory in advance of reaching pension age in order to ensure their entitlement to pension is decided by the due date.  Similarly, people who are in receipt of long term means tested payments, such as Disability Allowance, Jobseeker's Allowance, etc. are also proactively notified to claim State Pension Non-Contributory in advance of reaching pension age.In order to facilitate a good customer service all customers are advised to apply for a pension at least three months before reaching pension age.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The increasing Live Register has meant that Local Offices, being a frontline service, have borne the brunt of the additional workload as a result of the downturn in the economy.During the past year an additional 190 staff have been assigned to local offices throughout the country.  In addition, as many local offices are very close to capacity as regards accommodating further staff, the Department has set up a number of central decision units around the country.  Four such units are currently set up in Dublin, Sligo, Finglas and Carrick-on-Shannon.  Each unit has 10 staff.  It is now planned to establish three further units with 10 staff each in Roscommon, Tallaght and Wexford and these units should be operational within the next few months.A further 16 Social Welfare Inspectors have been assigned to various locations throughout the country to undertake means testing and other work associated with processing claims for the jobseekers allowance. Staffing levels are being monitored on an on-going basis.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.There are currently almost 85,000 recipients of rent supplement, a 42% increase since the end of 2007 and 11,300 recipients of mortgage interest supplement, a 175% increase since the end of 2007.The published estimate of expenditure for 2009 for rent supplement is €490.4m and €40.1m for mortgage interest supplement, an increase of €50.7 million and €12.5 million on the outturn of expenditure in 2008.In the current economic climate, it is difficult to estimate expenditure into the future. Expenditure on rent and mortgage interest supplement is closely monitored on a monthly basis taking into account trends in recipient numbers, average monthly payments and savings arising from the supplementary budget measures.Overall, it is expected that adequate provision has been made for both the rent supplement and mortgage interest schemes in 2009. Developments in relation to current year expenditure will continue to be closely monitored in the context of the Government's framework for reporting on public expenditure.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The live register is published by the Central Statistics Office on a monthly basis. The figures show that the number of persons signing on the Live Register at the 24th April 2009 is 384,448. This represents an increase of 188,850 on the number for the last week in April 2008 and an increase of 230,129 on the number for the last week of April 2007.While the monthly rate of increase has been coming down in recent months, from 36,498 in January to 13,177 in April, I am acutely conscious of how job losses on this scale impact on the individuals and families affected. Income support continues to be the department's first priority in relation to people who are unemployed. Despite the economic downturn, the rates of payment have been maintained above the level of inflation.The increase in the volume of claims for unemployment payments has imposed a severe strain on resources but the department has taken steps to ensure that waiting times are minimised.It is recognised that while income support is a crucial support, we must also do all we can to help get people back to work. The department through its Employment Support Services and in conjunction with other agencies continues to assist people on the live register to make the transition to work, education or training. Changes were made in the recent supplementary budget to the rate of payment in jobseeker's allowance to people under 20 in order to incentivise them to avail of training and education opportunities Under the National Employment Plan, people who are approaching 3 months on the live register are identified by the department and referred to FÁS for interview with a view to job placement or an offer of training.The Government is now providing, through FÁS, a total of 128,000 training and activation places for the unemployed this year. This is a substantial increase on the approximate 66,000 places taken up last year. Also, Job Search/National Employment Action Plan referral capacity has nearly doubled for 2009 from 6,500 cases per month to 12,250. This represents an unprecedented increase in capacity for this programme, which is being undertaken by FÁS in co-operation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs. In addition there are 146,700 places in further education programmes in 2009.The recent supplementary budget outlined a joint approach to activation agreed between the departments of Social and Family Affairs, Enterprise Trade & Employment and Education & Science. A range of additional measures were outlined aimed at maintaining people in employment, re-skilling and facilitating better access to allowances while avoiding undue negative impacts on vulnerable individuals.As part of the budget I introduced a package of measures relating to the back to work enterprise allowance and back to education allowance schemes to facilitate better access to supports. The package put together by the Departments of Enterprise, Trade & Employment and Education & Science has some 11 proposals to provide 23,435 extra employment and training scheme places.This demonstrates the scale of activity being supported by this Government to ensure that people are best positioned to get back into employment.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of rent or mortgage interest to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.The scheme also provides for an exceptional needs payment which may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost, such as a payment of a rent deposit, which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment and each application is determined by a community welfare officer based on the particular circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need.Rent supplement is payable to people who are unable to meet the cost of renting private accommodation.  The supplement is intended as a short-term income support to eligible tenants whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs. There are currently nearly 85,000 people in receipt of rent supplement, an increase of 42% since the end of December 2007.The mortgage interest supplement scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The scheme provides a short-term "safety net" within the overall social welfare scheme to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment.A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.There are currently over 11,300 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 175% over the number in payment at end 2007.The assessment for the existing rent and mortgage interest supplement provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive rent and mortgage interest supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.In the case of rent supplement, a person accepted as having a long term housing need who has been accepted as being eligible under the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) may engage in full time employment and still qualify for rent supplement, subject to standard means assessment rules.In view of the current economic environment, the Department is conducting a review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme.  The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence. Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, including the cap on hours of employment, are also being examined.The views of the community welfare service and other interested parties are currently being canvassed as part of the review.  In the interim, updated guidelines on the operation of the existing mortgage interest supplement scheme will issue shortly to community welfare service staff.The mortgage interest supplement scheme is administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the department.  The operational arrangements for the processing of applications and the payment to qualifying individuals, is a matter for the respective community welfare division areas.The HSE is reviewing the allocation of staff currently engaged on the delivery of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, including rent and mortgage interest supplement.The question of any increase in expenditure for staffing within the community welfare service above that currently provided would have to be considered in the context of overall Government policy on public service manpower levels.

The estimates for Jobseeker's Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Supplementary Welfare Allowance were significantly increased from the Estimates published at the time of the October Budget. These estimates were increased in line with the Department of Finance's projections of an average Live Register of 440,000 for the year.

The Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment to the Public Service with effect from 27th March 2009 and, as with the public service generally. The Defence Organisation is required to operate with reduced funding. In this context, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force has been suspended for the present.

The cost of the report was €161,259.  This report was published.  It was not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.In 2006, my Department carried out an Expenditure Review of Maintenance of Aircraft in the Air Corps.  The objective of the review was to ensure value for money. The cost included internal staff costs plus €3,220 for Report Quality Assurance by Epsilon Consulting.  The report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.In 2007, my Department carried out a Value for Money Review of Clothing Procurement in the Defence Forces.  The objective of the review was to ensure value for money. The cost included internal staff costs plus €2,904 for Report Quality Assurance by Petrus Consulting.  The report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  TNS MRBI, an independent market research company, was awarded the contract to undertake research into the issue of Recruitment and Retention of Women in the Defence Forces.  The research tested women's attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces.  The cost incurred was €48,000.  The results of this market research will assist in the formulation of policy and practice in this area for the future.  This report was published.  It was not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.The Independent Monitoring Group that was set up to give effect to the recommendations of the 2002 Doyle Report on Harassment, Bullying and Discrimination and Sexual Harassment in the Defence Forces, was reconstituted in February 2008.  The objective was to review progress and report on the implementation of the recommendations of the 2004 and 2002 reports.  The cost of this report was €37,109.  This report was published.  It was not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Also in 2008, PA Consultant Group was commissioned by my Department to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.  The consultancy focused on the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.  The contract was awarded in June 2008 and the cost of this review is €95,000, excluding VAT.  I am awaiting this report.  The report will be published when it has been completed.  Also in 2008, Entograph was commissioned by my Department to carry out a study to review and evaluate options for bracken control in the Glen of Imaal and identify a plan for its control.  The cost of this review was €30,129.  The report was not laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Also in 2008, Mott Mac Donald Limited was commissioned by my Department to carry out a review of Safety Policy at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  The cost of this review was €50,000.  I am awaiting this report.  It is not expected that the report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.In March 2009 my Department commissioned Deloitte to undertake a review of its Finance Branch.  The review is expected to be completed in mid-June.  The objective of the review is to examine the business processes, procedures and organisational structures in operation in the Finance Branch of my Department and to provide a report making recommendations for improvements in order to maximise efficiency and effectiveness.  The cost is €80,550 excluding VAT.  It is not expected that the report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Also in 2009, my Department carried out a Value for Money Review of the Naval Service Vessel Maintenance.  The objective of the review was to ensure value for money.  The cost included internal staff costs plus €2,800 for Report Quality Assurance by Raymond Burke Consulting.  The report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  A Value for Money Review of Military Training Lands commissioned from FGS Consulting is in progress.  The objective of the review is to ensure value for money.   The value of the contract is €90,000 including VAT.  A final report is due later in the year and on completion it will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.

As with the public service generally, the defence organisation is required to operate with reduced funding for 2009.  In this context, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force has been suspended for the present.  I accept that this will disappoint many individuals who have applied for enlistment in the Reserve.  Membership of the Reserve already requires a significant voluntary commitment of unpaid training.  In addition members of the Reserve undertake paid training.  While the budgetary provision for training of members of the Reserve has been reduced, it will be sufficient to provide for paid training for the existing members of the Reserve this year.  I appreciate that certain individuals wishing to join the Reserve are willing to forego paid training.  However, the recruitment of new personnel to the Reserve under differing terms and conditions to existing members of the Reserve would not be in the best interests of the Reserve Defence Force in general.

A private security firm has been employed to provide security at the barracks in the short term with effect from 30 January 2009.  As the appointment of this contractor is temporary, for commercial reasons it would be inappropriate to state the cost at this stage.  It is not anticipated that a Private Security firm will need to be employed in the long term.  However, my Department will continue to monitor the situation.  It is anticipated that Rockhill Barracks will be disposed of, taking account of the market conditions, to maximise the return to the Defence Forces and generate funding for reinvestment in Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure in accordance with Government policy.  Significant progress has been achieved over the past decade in re-equipping and developing Defence Forces capabilities, using the proceeds from the sales of surplus properties.  We need to ensure this progress is continued.  Having regard to the investment needs of the Defence Forces and given the current economic circumstances, it is important that my Department realises the full commercial value of the current properties.  As such, it will not be possible to make the property available for other use.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I propose to take Questions Nos. 198 and 214 together.The Wildlife Acts of 1976 and 2000 and the EU (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997, which transposed the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, provide the statutory basis for the protection of endangered species in Ireland.  The designation of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas under the directives helps to conserve and protect rare and threatened species such as the hen harrier, the chough and the Killarney fern.  My Department is involved in a wide range of specific projects to protect rare or endangered species, including, for example, the corncrake, the grey partridge and the freshwater pearl mussel.  In addition, my Department has been working with the Golden Eagle Trust on the reintroduction of extinct birds of prey into Ireland, such as the Golden Eagle in Donegal, the White Tailed Eagle in Kerry and the Red Kite in Wicklow.  I am aware that some of these reintroduced birds have died as a result of eating poisoned meat-based bait.  I am concerned about these incidents as not only do they endanger the fulfilment of our commitment to maintain and enhance Ireland's native wildlife, but they also harm our environmental and agricultural reputation at home and abroad.  I propose, therefore, to introduce new regulations to prohibit the use of poisoned meat-based bait.  My Department is in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on this matter to ensure that maximum protection is afforded to Ireland's wildlife while at the same time supporting good farming practice.

On 23 April 2009, I announced that the Government have decided not to proceed with the implementation of electronic voting in Ireland.In announcing the decision, I stated that significant additional costs would arise to advance electronic voting in Ireland and that the decision had been taken to avoid such costs, especially at a time of more challenging economic conditions.  The financial and other resources that would be involved in modifying the machines in advance of implementation could not be justified in present circumstances. I also stated that the public in broad terms appear to be satisfied with the present paper-based system and this must be recognised in decisions on the future steps to be taken with the electronic voting system.A process will now be put in place, including discussions with the supplier, to address the disposal of the electronic voting and counting equipment and termination of storage arrangements. Proposals made to my Department in this regard will be considered as part of the process.In February 2000, the Government approved the introduction of electronic voting and counting at elections in Ireland.  This was followed by an invitation to tender for an electronic voting and counting system through notices in the EU Official Journal and the national press leading to a decision on the chosen system.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission.  To assist in consideration of the issues involved, I commissioned a report by an expert group from UCD.  I published the report for consultation on 10 February 2009, with a closing date for submissions of 26 June 2009.The report is available on my Department's website and I have forwarded a copy to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government inviting its input into the consultation process that is currently underway.

These sites had previously been designated as SPAs but it was considered necessary to amend the boundaries of all three sites with the effect of increasing the proportion of Dublin Bay that is protected.Under the provisions of the European Communities (Habitats) Regulations 1997, public notification affords these sites the full protection of the Regulations from the date of notification, including any part of the proposed SPA that may be under appeal.Local landowners, businesses, marine users and residents were notified directly of these changes and the proposal to designate was also advertised in national newspapers and on three radio stations.A three month period was given to all land and marine users and persons with a legal interest in the area in which to object to the designation.  There were no appeals on the North Bull Island and Howth Head Coast SPAs .The South Dublin Bay and River Tolka Estuary SPA is the subject of one appeal — the Dublin Port Authority has objected to the inclusion within the SPA of 31 hectares of inshore area adjacent to its lands. The appeals process is currently underway and will result in a recommendation to me, based solely on the criteria as stipulated in the EU Birds Directive, as to whether this area should be included in the designed area or not.  I expect this appeals process to be completed in a matter of weeks.

Section 10 of the Code of Practice details the specific reporting requirements placed on such bodies, particularly in relation to the production of annual reports and accounts.  In general, the legislation relating to the establishment of these bodies also details the requirements to produce such reports and present these to the Minister.Annual reports and/or the audited accounts of the bodies under the aegis of my Department are furnished to me as Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, in line with the requirements set out above.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The information requested in respect of my Department is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The Water Framework Directive requires that Member States take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services. Accordingly, the Government's Water Pricing Policy requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. The policy provides for full cost recovery without profit, with charges based on actual metered consumption.In January 2008, the Government introduced transitional arrangements for charging schools for water services.  The transitional arrangements provide for a flat rate amounting to €4.00 per pupil in the current year (the fee for 2007 was €3.00 and for 2008 was €3.50).  To ensure compliance with the Water Framework Directive, the transitional arrangements will cease at the end of this year and all schools will be charged for water services on a full cost recovery and volumetric basis with effect from 1 January 2010.In relation to other rates, local authorities have a statutory obligation to levy commercial rates on properties that are included in the valuation lists prepared by the Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The amount of rates is calculated having regard to the valuation of the property as determined by the Valuation Office and the annual rate on valuation as determined by local authority members in their annual budget.It is entirely a matter for each local authority to determine the annual rate on valuation when their annual budgets are being adopted.  This decision is at the absolute discretion of the elected members of each local authority having regard to the needs of their area, the level and range of services to be provided and all the sources of revenue, including commercial rates, charges and central government grants available to finance those services.  I, as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, have no function in the determination of the annual rate on valuation.School buildings used exclusively for the provision of educational services on a not-for-profit basis and property occupied by a charitable body where the facilities are not used for making a private profit are not rateable under schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001.  In addition, community halls which are not licensed for the sale of alcohol are not rateable under schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001.

This decision is effective from 31 March 2009 and stands until the end of 2010.  My Department has, accordingly, written to all local authorities requesting their compliance.However, in recognition of the priority attaching to the maintenance of key frontline services, my Department is consulting with the Department of Finance in regard to the management of relevant staffing needs.  The needs of local authority fire services will be considered in this context.In regard to the staffing requirements in each local authority, it is the responsibility of each county and city manager, under the Local Government Act 2001, to employ such staff and to make such staffing and organisational arrangements as may be deemed necessary for the purposes of carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is the manager. The specific matters relating to individual fire stations raised in the question are, accordingly, appropriately determined at local level.

The specification for products supported under the Greener Homes Scheme or the Home Energy Saving Scheme would not cover the product in question, particularly as open fires by their nature are inherently inefficient with typically less than 30% efficiency.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	466	The Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme is administered by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  SEI recommends that people participating in the HES who are uncertain about their best options for energy saving avail of the before/after BER grant.  Initial indications are that as many as one third of applicants plan to avail of this option.  There will also be homeowners who are already familiar with the measures in place or needed in their house and they will doubtless select on the basis of that knowledge.  In developing the HES scheme, it was concluded by SEI that it would be unreasonable to oblige homeowners to incur the BER cost as a mandatory requirement to grant eligibility.  The arrangements for the enforcement of BER by local authorities/building control authorities has been set out in the reply given by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to Question Nos. 372 and 377 on 28 April 2009.  The position is unchanged.

Solar panels harness heat for hot water and space heating.  Wind-turbines, on the other hand, are installed primarily to generate electricity.  Solar panels qualify for support under the Greener Homes Scheme operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI).  It is a qualifying condition that equipment approved under this scheme meets internationally accepted certification standards.  Only a very small minority of domestic-scale wind turbine products have been independently verified in accordance with the internationally recognised standard (IEC/EN 61400-12-1).  Domestic wind turbine technology is therefore included in the Small- and Micro-Scale Generation Field Trials programme operated by SEI which, among other things, will assess appropriate products and quality standards for the domestic-scale turbines and appropriate installation requirements.

I will continue to seek the introduction of EID on a voluntary basis and some other Member States support this position.  The Commission and most Member States are, however firmly attached to the introduction of EID by the end of this year.  My Department is in contact with the Commission, other Member States and Stakeholders in relation to detailed aspects of EID.  These discussions are without prejudice to the continuing political discussion on the overall policy in relation to EID.  I am anxious that all Irish concerns are taken into account in whatever system is finally implemented.I should also point out that under the EU legislation, EID will not apply to sheep born before January 2010 nor generally will there be a need to retag existing sheep.  Furthermore provision is made whereby lambs intended for slaughter and less than 12 months old can be permanently excluded from the EID requirement.  If this provision is applied by Ireland, it will reduce the number of animals affected by EID substantially.

However, the number of applicants in County Kerry who will receive forestry premium payments in the annual payment run is 1,514.  The average premium payment per head is approximately €3,497.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Ireland's Direct Sales Quota for 2008/2009 was 2,146,481 kgs, which equates to 0.04% of Ireland's total national quota.  For the EU as a whole, 2.28% of total quota is allocated to direct sales.  All Member states with the exception of one (Romania) have a quota allocation that is greater in Deliveries than Direct Sales.  Malta has no quota allocated to Direct Sales.  In order to sell milk directly to the consumer, a milk producer would need to allocate part or all of his/her quota to Direct Sales and satisfy dairy hygiene requirements.In Ireland, the volume of milk sold directly to the consumer has reduced substantially in recent years.  During the 2002/2003 quota year, milk sales accounted for 38.63% of dairy products sold directly to the consumer.  The corresponding figure for the 2007/2008 quota year was 8.78%.  The volume of quota allocated to Direct Sales reduced by 76.86% between 2002/03 and 2007/08.

For REPS 4, this means that applications to join the Scheme must be submitted by 15 May each year.  Any application to join REPS 4, including resubmitted applications which may have been previously rejected, which are submitted after May 15 cannot be considered for payment in the same calendar year.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The draft Seafood Development Operational Programme was advertised for public consultation in October 2008.  Issues were raised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on behalf of CFB (Central Fisheries Board) regarding the grant-aiding of projects where environmental issues arise relating to compliance with the EU Birds and Habitats Directives and sea lice control on salmon farms.My Department with its agencies working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has developed a plan to deliver compliance with the EU Birds and Habitat Directives for wild fisheries and aquaculture over a determined timeframe.  This plan has been submitted to DG Environment for consideration.  I have also met with EU Environment Commissioner Dimas to promote a resolution of these difficulties.A meeting between my Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Agencies and DG Environment is to take place in Brussels on 13 May to discuss the plan with a view to securing DG Environment's support for the approach set down in the plan.  My Department is also in discussion with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to inform them on the significant progress made in relation to managing sea lice levels on salmon farms.  I am hopeful that the concerns raised have been satisfactorily addressed and that we will be in a position to adopt the Operational Programme for Fisheries in the near future.A provision of €5m has been made for aquaculture development in the Vote for 2009 and to date I have approved the spending of €3.8m of this for aquaculture projects in both the BMW and S&E regions under the 2000-06 OP which will assist the continued operation of aquaculture projects in these areas and the employment that they support.

The site in question is currently licensed to another person for 10 years with effect from 9th May 2005.  This person applied for an aquaculture licence in respect of a further area adjacent to his existing licensed site.  In October 2006 my Department advised the applicant that it was not in a position to recommend the application.I should also add that the area for which this licence was sought is a designated Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive (Natura 2000 site).  As such any applications will require to be considered in the context of ongoing discussions between my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the EU Commission on the issue of aquaculture activities in Natura 2000 sites generally.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-04-30 00:00:00	Prelude	488	The EU Fisheries Council acting on a proposal from the EU Commission decides which fish stocks are subject to a Total Allowable Catch (TAC)  and quota regime.  The allocation of quotas (per-cent shares) between Member States is based to a large extent on recent track record of fishing by Member States fishing fleets.The stocks in western waters specified by the Deputy are not at this time subject to a TAC and quota regime. Consequently, it is open to any registered fishing vessel to target such species.  If industry representatives wish to introduce national management arrangements in respect of these species I will certainly consider any proposals that they may have.

The project to which the Deputy refers was not included in this announcement.  Therefore, it is unlikely that it will be progressed further in 2009.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.

These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) Courses. The Higher Education Grant Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department; the other three maintenance grant schemes are administered on a similar basis by the VECs.Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  The decision on eligibility for student grants is a matter for the relevant assessing authority — i.e. the local authority or VEC.

Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.I understand that the SENO has notified the relevant parties in relation to the decision taken on the application for additional resources made on behalf of the pupil in question.The NCSE will undertake to review a decision taken by a SENO on foot of a request from a school or parents/guardians, when accompanied by relevant additional information, which may not have been to hand at the time of the decision.  The NCSE has outlined this process in its Circular 01/05.
