Apologies have been received from Deputy Joanna Tuffy. At the request of the broadcasting unit, can members please ensure that their mobile phones are turned off completely for the duration of the meeting and not just left in silent mode. For the information of members, the broadcasting unit will broadcast the public session of this meeting live. The proceedings will be carried on UPC channel 207. We will now go into private session to deal with correspondence and other housekeeping matters.

I once heard a story about a fellow who, when he was told during a public meeting that the Deputies had to go to the Dáil Chamber to vote, said "We did not vote for you to be in the Dáil voting". It is part of the job. I apologise for the delay. We welcome the officials from the Department of Education and Skills to discuss whole school approaches to mental health and bullying. The Children's Mental Health Coalition will give a presentation on these two topics. I welcome the following: Margaret Grogan, regional director of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, who will give a presentation on mental health; Deirdre McDonnell, principal officer, central policy unit, who will give a presentation on bullying; Doreen McMorris, assistant chief inspector; Frances Shearer, national co-ordinator social and personal health education support services; and Hubert Loftus, responsible for teacher allocation and school governance policies. I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. The opening statements the witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting. Members are reminded of the same parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make changes against a person outside the Houses, or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Ms McDonnell and Ms Grogan to make their opening remarks.

They are very welcome and overdue. I commend the Department on coming forward with them. What resources does the Department feel will be required to ensure that the objectives set out in the guidelines will be achieved, and to support teachers and other school staff to ensure that we protect our children as well as we can and give them the support they require. The reduction this year in the guidance counselling service, following last year's budget decision to remove the €32 million allocated to guidance counselling hours, requiring schools to use teaching hours instead and draw on the same funding pot, has had a serious impact on ensuring best protection of students' mental health. Guidance counsellors are trained to assist students and without them we would need to develop a support network and similar service to enact the guidelines. It is counter-productive to on the one hand try to introduce guidelines and on the other diminish the capacity of schools to support students as best they can. We must ensure that there is a whole-school approach and all members of staff must be aware of students' needs and play their part. There is, however, a one-to-one service provided by qualified guidance counsellors who have gone through the appropriate training. It is important that whenever somebody is referred and knocks on the guidance counsellor's door there is somebody behind that door. They often deal with crises, which need to be addressed immediately.

The guidelines build on the existing processes in some schools, others are more advanced and ready to roll out programmes. What resources are needed for this? What monitoring processes will be put in place to see how well schools adhere to or implement the guidelines?
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	I acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the Children's Mental Health Coalition and its various member organisations. It is very worthwhile. We need a more child-centred approach to this issue. Last year during the course of the debate before the referendum on the Thirty-First Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Bill it was discovered and brought to our notice that over 30,000 children had welfare concerns, some of which related to bullying and other issues such as mental health problems. While supports for parents dealt with many of those, many related to mental health problems. Our system has changed compared with that of two generations back. Most parents work and there is very little communication between parents and children, due to financial constraints. After school care systems are largely underdeveloped here compared with other countries. That needs to be addressed fairly urgently. Children do not need money. We did not have money when we were going school. Money is given to children today and they have plenty of cash. They need other supports, they need adults and personnel around them to take an interest in their points of view. This is absent from a child's life today. When I was going to school I never heard a child say he or she was fed up. We did not have the same number of electronic devices as children today have. There is an absence of services for young children when their parents are working. How can this be addressed? There is a serious lack of resources and support for children and there are real enemies which lead to personal tragedies in many children's lives. Something needs to be done to address this situation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	The Minister has allocated €500,000 this year to begin implementing the action plan on bullying. We are confident we can make progress on that this year with a range of measures to raise awareness, and to train parents, boards of management and teachers. My colleague, Mr. Loftus, will say a few words about guidance.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	My job in the Department is managing teacher allocations. We operate in a climate in which we have a ceiling on teacher numbers and fixed payroll budgets which we have to manage at a time of increasing demographics. The choice for Government when it was making its budgetary decision on guidance counsellors was to increase the pupil-teacher ratio or to bring guidance within quota. It chose to bring guidance within the standard allocation. It is important to bear in mind that all schools are required to provide guidance within the quota. In the past there were over 700 whole-time equivalent guidance posts. The budget saving yielded 500 posts and we used the extra 200 posts to shelter the most disadvantaged, the DEIS schools. The 200 DEIS post-primary schools had an increase in their staffing allocation. For example, in the past a 500-pupil DEIS school, which would be fairly typical, would have had an allocation of about 29 teachers plus one guidance post, making a total of 30. Typically, one guidance post would have been allocated for every 500 pupils. Based on the increased staffing allocation given to the DEIS schools this year, that school would have been given 30 posts. In a sense, all the DEIS schools are largely unaffected by the Government decision to bring guidance posts within quota and they were sheltered. However, the non-DEIS schools are affected. A non-DEIS 500-pupil school has to manage guidance counselling within its allocation of 29 teachers. Equally, if the budget decision was different and the pupil-teacher ratio was changed, such a non-DEIS school would have to manage such provision within an allocation of 29 teachers. That is the context here. On the wider issue of guidance, a whole-school approach is the best way to provide it. It is best that it is not only the sole focus of the guidance teacher in the school. It is the focus of everyone in the school and the whole-school approach is the best way to address it. The management bodies in the school system and the Association of Principals and Deputy Principals provided a framework for schools and gave guidance to them on how to manage within that framework. The focus of it is to maximise the way in which they use their resources. All of us in the public sector have to achieve more with less. That applies to the Department and agencies, and schools are no different. Schools cannot be exempt from that requirement. We shelter them as much as we can. There are clear options in terms of maximising this resource in that as much as possible of the career guidance element is delivered in class settings rather than on a one-to-one basis and that as much of the guidance counsellor's time as possible is targeted towards those pupils who need one-to-one support. I will ask Ms Doreen McMorris to add to that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	I will speak about the important role guidance counsellors play but I wish to return to the point made about the specialist qualifications of guidance counsellors. It is true they are qualified to provide counselling support for students. It is important to distinguish between that type of support and the type of qualification a professional counsellor would have. The guidance counsellors in our schools undertake a postgraduate qualification. They are first and foremost teachers. They undertake a postgraduate qualification to enable them to provide a guidance counselling service in our schools. That involves counselling support but it also equips them to fulfil a much wider remit, which very much includes planning for guidance. The guidance plan in a school, which should be part of the whole-school plan, is critically important. It should lay out all the different forms of support for students and those supports are delivered by different people in different ways. The one-to-one support provided by guidance counsellors is well recognised as being very important. The Department's circular, which was issued at the time of the removal of the ex quota allocation, clearly states that schools should prioritise guidance counsellors' time for the one-to-one counselling that is necessary. There is no doubt about that, but it is important to realise that many other members of the school community are well positioned to support students in different ways. As Mr. Hubert Loftus has outlined, schools now have the autonomy to decide how best to use their resources. It might be of interest to the members to note that in 2006 and 2007 the inspectorate undertook inspections in 55 post-primary schools across the different sectors. It is of significance that at that time just under a third of schools were found not to be using their ex quota allocation for guidance. It appears at that time when schools had an ex quota allocation that allocation was not always given to the guidance area. That is an important point to remember. Schools principals and boards now have full autonomy to decide what portion of the overall resourcing should go into this area. It appears from research that students feel comfortable approaching a range of different people for support - it is not always the guidance counsellor. Some ESRI research conducted in 2006 shows that also. There is general recognition that schools have an important role in terms of prevention and identifying students with needs but it is not as clear who should be providing such support. It is important to remember that in terms of our young people. Responsibility in this respect must be spread across the area and young people have a wide variety of needs.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	The key to the successful implementation of the mental health guidelines lies in taking a co-ordinated whole-school approach and the guidelines set out the existing elements that are available to schools such as school staff evaluation processes, the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum, whole-school guidance planning, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, continuum of support and the inter-agency collaboration and support that is available externally to schools. The guidelines set out the integration of all those elements which are already in place. The services for schools to support this are already in existence. For example, the Social, Personal and Health Education Support Service is available to provide training for schools, and my colleague, Ms Frances Shearer, may wish to say more about that. I represent NEPS. Our service is available to support schools in promoting mental health. In collaboration with the SPHE support service, we would be available to schools to build on the professional development work they do with teachers. We would be available to advise and support schools on whole-school guidance planning and on developing student support structures and teams. Schools can draw on the expertise in our service for their developmental needs. We also provide Incredible Years teacher training which focuses on behaviour management and classroom management. We are currently rolling out the Friends for Life programme. It uses a cognitive behavioural approach to managing anxiety and stress and is applicable at primary and post-primary level. The elements in that programme complement and are part of the SPHE curriculum. In addition, the NEPS provides guidelines and support to schools to deal with crises or tragic events that may occur. This is very important in terms of prevention. Our focus is on early intervention and prevention. The continuum of support which has been rolled out by NEPS to primary schools since 2007 and to post-primary schools since 2010 is a framework for schools whereby we ask them to identify early on the needs and supports young people require before those needs become serious difficulties. In terms of our work with schools, it is on that area we will be focusing our attention in the coming years.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	I wish to say a few words about my own experience of having been involved in the SPHE support service for the past 12 years. We have had a stand-alone SPHE support service for all that time, which has been a considerable time in which to support schools to embed a subject like SPHE which was very new 12 years ago. It came into the curriculum in 2000. Over that time I have observed a growing awareness among schools of the importance of subjects like SPHE, but the other big change in the past three or four years has been the high level of awareness among schools of the importance of the whole-school context. There was somewhat of a view that SPHE dealt with health subjects and young people with problems went to the guidance counsellor. There has been a much broader understanding of this area during the past number of years and that has been evidenced in the past four or five years in the improved and significantly greater level of engagement we have had with schools. Our numbers of teachers coming out have doubled in the past three or four years and the largest source of that increase has been whole-staff work. There has been a tremendous appetite from schools for workshops on promoting the welfare of students; it is probably our most popular whole-staff workshop. Bullying prevention and intervention is the next most popular one.The concept of student well-being in the broadest sense, supported by the whole school, is becoming very well established. The mental health guidelines will obviously support that. Another very important development is the new junior cycle framework, which is permeated with the concept of well-being. This will constitute further support and impetus for schools towards taking good care of young people.

The latter is very important. I welcome the allocation of €500,000 for the action plan on bullying. While it is a step in the right direction, the funding will be very much diluted when divided between all the schools. I hope we will see more in this regard. I have a couple of questions. Is there monitoring of students' use of social media, such as Facebook and Bebo, within schools? Do the delegates ever use the services of Jigsaw? It is very popular among students. Could representatives of Jigsaw be asked to give talks to students? In my locality within the past few months, two young boys from the same school committed suicide. They were of different cultures and nationalities and I am not sure whether the two incidents were related. This was an eye-opener and it was shocking. One often wonders what could be on young people's minds because they do not have worries about repaying mortgages, finding a job or other such troubles. I listened to what was said on the radio over the past few days, and about www.spunout.ie. I actually thought I was broad-minded but what I heard was an absolute eye-opener regarding what young people have to deal with. I raised two children and never encountered anything like what was mentioned occurring. It was shocking to learn that teenagers could-----

I have a couple of questions. How effective is SPHE as a subject? Is it working? Is there feedback on the turnover of teachers who are teaching SPHE? As a teacher, I was very often told that new teachers are handed SPHE classes, and that students regard SPHE as a filler class because it is not an exam subject. It is very important that the SPHE curriculum be followed completely because the course content is excellent. It certainly does a lot to combat bullying and it allows for it to be discussed. The Department's inspectorate evaluates the schools' anti-bullying policies through the SPHE subject inspections. Is there feedback on whether schools' anti-bullying policies are being implemented? Is there proof of this? Given the changes to the allocation for career guidance teachers, is there provision in third level colleges to teach counselling to those doing teacher training? It is a question of a whole-school approach whereby all teachers can offer counselling, albeit not at a professional level. Students should be able to feel comfortable discussing matters with any teacher, not just the guidance counsellor. Is there teacher training in this regard, be it for primary or secondary teachers?
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	I would like to follow on from Senator Moloney’s point on social media and the guidelines that are in place in schools. Facebook and Twitter have no guidelines, or else the guidelines are very sketchy. Having been on boards of management down through the years, especially in secondary schools, I noted that board members had to act as judge and jury in deciding whether a young person who had not settled in well on making the transition from primary school should stay in the school and be given a second chance or be taken out of the school. One evening, after having dealt with the cases of five or six young people at a meeting of the board of management, I was traumatised. We must put in place a system for boards of management of secondary schools in this regard. The experience I had was one that I would not like anybody else to endure.

What has been the input of the Special Education Support Service and CAMHS to the various guidelines produced recently on bullying and mental health strategies? Continuous professional development for teachers was touched upon by Senator Moran. With regard to NEPS, a number of schools have access to private assessments. How is NEPS focusing on the schools that do not? Is there a policy in this regard? What I experienced, which may have changed in the two years since I was in the classroom, was that clinical assessments in respect of behavioural problems were not offered through NEPS. Is there a policy to change that such that children with behavioural problems may be assessed? Senator Moran referred to the new four-year Bachelor of Education qualification and the two-year higher diploma qualification. Is there capacity in teacher training for greater emphasis on anti-bullying and mental health strategies?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	I will give a quick summary and some of my colleagues may then add to it. With regard to monitoring, as raised by Deputy O'Brien, we have a couple of relevant actions in the action plan on bullying with regard to monitoring in SPHE inspections and whole-school evaluation. It is a question of building it in for the future in schools' self-evaluation. With regard to some of the cyber issues that were raised, schools generally have acceptable-use policies. There is guidance from Webwise on how to develop them in a template. We have recommended in the action plan on bullying that the bullying policy in a school be linked to the code of behaviour and other relevant policies, such as acceptable-use policies. This is because bullying cannot be regarded as a stand-alone issue; the policy on it needs to be linked to other relevant policies.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	21	I will start with Jigsaw. There has been close collaboration between the services of the Department and Jigsaw. The Meath mental health project was a pilot project in which there was an integrated approach to addressing the needs of schools in respect of mental health. It involved the HSE, NEPS, SPHE support service, guidance counsellors, etc. The learning from this has been collated and evaluated, and it will apply in future to collaborative work.As services are localised and there is not a standard approach across the country, it is important that at a local level agencies and services come together depending on how they are configured. NEPS and the SPHE support service will be collaborating, where appropriate, with Jigsaw approaches. That will be informed by the learning that is already there. As regards psychological and behavioural assessments, NEPS psychologists would be involved with assessment work. We do not automatically start doing psychological assessments. NEPS provides a framework through the continuum of support, which we are slowly rolling out to schools and getting them to buy into it. That is very much an early intervention, prevention approach so that we provide consultation, support and advice to schools as to how they can best use their existing resources to meet the needs of young people without resort to seeking a psychological assessment. In that way, we hope we will reduce the demand for psychological assessment. We will then be able to see the young people who need that individual approach in order to reduce that demand.  With regard to access to clinical assessment, we are engaged in conversation with CAMHS, the child and adolescent mental health services, and primary care psychology services. We are hoping to work together more closely with them. It is probable that some of the experience from the Meath mental health project would inform our thinking around that. However, we need to collaborate more with them as regards how to support young people who have severe difficulties. It is not just about external agencies, it is also about the schools' role in supporting those young people with external supports. The guidelines provide good evidence-based advice for schools on their role in supporting students to keep them in school.  As regards the number of assessments, we would not work like that. We do not have waiting lists, for example. We advise schools on how they can do the early intervention and assessment work themselves. We work towards building skills around that within the school.

However, I want to get more clarity on my question concerning clinical assessments. If, after a school goes through every possible intervention to benefit a child's needs, they are crying out for a clinical assessment, would NEPS provide that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	NEPS psychologists are educational psychologists. Is the Deputy referring to clinical psychology?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	25	That would be a psychological assessment with a view to identifying therapeutic needs that young people might have. NEPS psychologists provide psychological assessment for young people. If they have emotional behavioural difficulties we can do assessments around that, but it would be with a view to informing the school about planning within the school and the provision of education. If there are therapeutic needs or inputs of a clinical nature, that would be for our colleagues in the HSE. We would support the schools and advise on referral. Ideally, if it is a clinical intervention we would support the schools in providing information to the clinical CAMH services. Where possible, we work closely with CAMH services and would advise schools to build relationships and liaison, as well as working out referral pathways. That must be done locally because there is not a standard national approach. It is very much about schools linking in. Our HSE colleagues are aware of the need to be more proactive. I know there is more commitment to providing supports and resources within the HSE for this work.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	One of Senator Moran's questions was about the implementation of anti-bullying policies. One of the actions in the action plan published in January was to better strengthen the oversight arrangements in schools concerning implementation so that there is a better consistency of approach. We are updating the existing guidelines to take account of that. Dr. Mona O'Moore, who is an acknowledged expert in the area of anti-bullying, would regard our existing guidelines - although they are a bit dated - as being very good. However, we are strengthening them in terms of better oversight. As part of that, there will be better oversight for the board of management within the school. In addition, the school principal will provide periodic reports to the board of management on incidents of bullying and how they are dealt with. There will be a standardised approach across all schools, including check-lists, monitoring implementation and an annual review of how bullying policy is implemented. That is recorded in the board of management records which ultimately would be available to our inspectorate whenever they are inspecting that school.  Another action within the action plan is for a thematic evaluation of bullying policies generally within the school system.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	In the course of our inspection work, inspectors check that there is an anti-bullying policy in place and, if necessary, they comment on the quality of it. To answer the question on implementation, they do not check how it is implemented as such. It is not possible in the context of a short visit to a school. However, in the course of our work, questionnaires are administered to parents and students. On the question of bullying, we have had post-primary parents' questionnaires from over 8,000 parents in 2012. Parents were asked if they were happy with how bullying was dealt with in the school. I just happen to have the exact data here. By way of response, 67% either agreed or strongly agreed. Some 8.7% disagreed and 24% - this is a cause of concern - indicated that they did not know whether or not they were happy. We do that on a regular basis through the questionnaires.

It was said earlier that there is not an inspection as to how effective they are in the school as such, but there is a commentary. As these are new guidelines, is there a senior manager reporting currently within the Department and responsible for trying to roll them out? Can we have a breakdown on the €500,000 worth of resources as to where they are being allocated? It was mentioned earlier that guidance counsellors provide autonomy to schools. I have often heard the Minister say that while €32 million is being taken away from career guidance, it provides empowerment to schools to make their own decisions on how they provide it. Let us call a spade a spade - that is sugar coating what is effectively a cut to front-line services delivering mental health and guidance counselling to school students.

The assistant chief inspector, Ms McMorris, pointed out earlier that in a recent survey, one third of schools were not using their ex-quota allocation for guidance provision for that purpose. They were using it for some other purpose. That is quite alarming and it indicates the problem and wrong-headedness of giving power to schools to decide how they allocate career guidance or counselling services. If they were not providing it in one third of schools when there was an ex-quota allocation for it, how can we now ensure that service is provided in all schools when there is not an ex-quota allocation? Is it the case that they may be told instead to take it from other resources and to cut elsewhere?Based on that evidence, it will not happen. The Minister is selling this as empowering schools but it is, in effect, a cut, which will make it more difficult to achieve what the guidelines intend.

Has anyone asked students how well they think anti-bullying policies are working? Do we have any figures on that? While new guidelines have been put in place, we are considering updating the guidelines on bullying policies and everyone agrees that a whole-school approach is the only way to go, we are developing a situation in which everyone is responsible but no one is accountable. Who is accountable within the school structure if bullying policies are not properly implemented?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	On accountability, boards of management are the legal entities which manage provision and are required to provide education and implement guidelines and procedures. On the person responsible in the Department for managing this, my job is managing teacher allocation and redeployment. Part of that has been managing the guidance provision and implementing that budget measure. In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, he was been clear and upfront that it was a budget measure and, as such, would make life more challenging for schools. Equally, he was clear about protecting the most disadvantaged schools by improving their staffing allocations. The other part of my job involves child protection and bullying. My job includes updating the bullying procedures. The action plan was published in January. I have met with education partners and we are on a pathway to have them in place for September.

Therefore when one is on a secondary school board of management, one becomes part of the judge and jury. What policies have been put in place for boards of management? Not all bullying takes place in school. It is outside school and in the home also but there are no policies in place for boards of management. I am not getting an answer and I am a little frustrated.

That will be based on the new procedures which we are developing for roll-out from September. That is what some of the €500,000 will be used for. It will support boards of management and parents to ensure that everybody is fully informed of how to deal effectively with bullying in schools. That is part of the roll-out.

We provide questionnaires to students at primary and post-primary level and ask them about bullying. I do not have the data to hand, but they are asked about how safe they feel in school etc. It is one dimension of how we try to ensure practices are being implemented. They raise questions for individual schools. The questionnaires are all anonymous. In our reports, we refer to the questions that the analysis of the questionnaires raises for schools. If the results for a school are out of kilter with national returns, there are questions for that school.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	54	I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to members today on this important topic. We are pleased to be here. A number of members of the coalition are with me and will be available to answer questions. I will provide introductory remarks which I will keep as brief as possible. With me are Eleanor McClorey from Young Ballymun, Marie-Louise Neary from Headstrong, Annette Clarke, schools facilitator in the Jigsaw Meath project, which was referred to earlier, and Moira Leydon from the ASTI. We expected to attend before the committee on 24 April 2013 and had lined up Professor Margaret Barry, an international expert on this topic, to speak. She addressed a seminar we held last March, which was excellent.I would like to let the committee know that Professor Barry is not available today but would be available on 24 April if members would like to hear more about this topic. We welcome the fact that the guidelines have been published. It is an important development. The coalition comprises approximately 55 member organisations from a range of backgrounds and sectors ranging from the children's rights and human rights sectors to the educational and mental health services sector.  We made a submission to the Department of Education and Skills last September on the topic of mental health in the education system. We welcome the publication of the guidelines and the fact that they adopt a whole-school approach. Young people's mental health and well-being are recognised as fundamental to the achievement of educational goals. The economic benefits of early intervention in the area of mental health are well established. Schools are uniquely placed to promote positive mental health but also to pick up on and be an early identifier of students who are in distress and to be a referral point for students. Members will have copies of a document I prepared. I will not have the time to go through all of it but I will bring the members briefly through it. Studies have shown that it is important to move beyond an individual curriculum-based focus or classroom focus and instead to have a whole-school complex approach to mental health promotion. It is a multi-component approach which involves the whole school and the community, with different levels of intervention and a wide range of people involved. It is quite a complex model to put in place but it is very worthwhile for schools and communities to implement it. There are good examples of how this is being done in Ireland. We have the Jigsaw Meath project, as was mentioned, and Young Ballymun is doing excellent work with primary schools in adopting a whole-school approach. While the guidelines are a very welcome development, vital factors are missing in terms of their implementation, which are needed if the guidelines are to become a reality in schools.  I will first address the issue of resources, which many members raised with the representatives of the Department of Education and Skills. The guidelines for mental health do not bring with them any additional resources to ensure their successful implementation. Schools are expected to implement the guidelines within already thinly stretched resources but fundamentally without access to any additional professional consultation or support. We consider the need for such financial support or resources as twofold, and recognising the fact that there has been a change in the allocation of funding for guidance counsellors, this is all the more crucial.  Schools may need advice, training and support on how best to implement a whole-school approach to this area. While the guidelines provide some guidance on this, which I welcome, Ms Margaret Grogan from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, talked about the systemic work it does with schools. NEPS has continuously pointed out over the years that it is not sufficiently resourced to do that systematic work with schools to develop a psychologically supportive environment on the scale that is needed because the demands on it for psychological assessments are so high that it does not have the resources required. We argue that resources should be put in place to support schools in doing that.  Schools need to have access to backup and consultation on how to manage the mental health needs of individual students in the educational context. This can sometimes help to shift the focus from referral and assessment, which I appreciate is also important. However, other forms of advice and consultation for schools on how best to support the student within the school setting could involve NEPS, and they should also involve other agencies like CAMHS, the national education support service, and the National Education Welfare Board, NEWB. A range of agencies should be involved. The lack of funding for implementation of the mental health guidelines is in stark contrast with the allocation of funding for the implementation of the anti-bullying guidelines. I point out for the information of the members that in Scotland it was recently announced that £1 million is to be allocated annually to implement its mental health in schools programme to increase training in specialist skills and service design. It introduced a self-assessment system in 2005, similar to the guidelines we published recently, but it found in recent reviews that this did not meet the requirements of schools. There was a lack of co-ordination, backup and consultation for schools. It has changed its approach on realising that there is a need for more intensive support. It sends out a signal in terms of the priority being given to mental health in the Department of Education and Skills that guidelines have not come with the resources required for their implementation. I wish to move on to an issue that was raised with regard to clarity of responsibility and the interaction between agencies, which is crucial to the implementation of these guidelines. We need clarity about the relationship among schools, NEPS, CAMHS, primary care psychology services, the NEWB, the National Behaviour Support Service, NBSS, and the Special Education Support Service. Members of the coalition report to us and we have a broad range of mental health professionals involved as well, but there is a lack of clarity around the country on what their role is in terms of mental health in schools. The guidelines state: "As the availability and accessibility of services vary across the country, schools should identify the services available in their area and develop referral protocols with them." This is something to which the Department has referred. It is a very difficult task for schools to figure out on their own. It involves multiple factors, many of which are completely outside their control. I welcome the fact that Ms Margaret Grogan said that NEPS would be working closely with CAMHS on this, but this needs to be dealt with at a national level. There needs to be national policy for inter-agency co-operation, and agreed working practices need to be developed. Any mapping of this inter-agency work should incorporate key officials and senior responsibility for the implementation of the guidelines. This is crucial to establishing proper referral pathways for schools but also to having a consistent nationwide approach. I appreciate that services will differ in local areas. With the imminent appointment of a director of mental health services, there is an opportunity to assign senior responsibility for mental health in schools within that directorate, but it should also be jointly managed and overseen by the Department of Education and Skills in terms of senior responsibility for the area of mental health in schools. We consider this to be crucial. Another element with regard to the implementation of the guidelines - this leads on from inter-agency collaboration - is the lack of a co-ordination office. We recommend that there should be a HSE liaison office that would advise, organise and oversee this joint agency approach. It would also provide schools with the necessary guidance and advice they need from mental health professionals. This could work at both national and regional level. There could be a national co-ordinator to ensure consistency but at a regional level such an office could facilitate schools in meeting in groups, which would provide for a better use of the various resources with the input of SPHE support staff, HSE health promotion staff, NEPS, NEBS, the Special Education Support Service, local GPs and primary care psychology services. That would provide for a sharing of resources and a sharing of the experience of the whole-school approach within schools, with schools building on knowledge and supporting each other on how to do this within the whole community. Those regional clusters could form part of a national schools mental health network and this could greatly enhance the three tiers of support within the guidelines - support for all, support for some and support for few. In our document we have outlined some of the ways in which that could be done. This would be a clever use of resources, and rather than directing resources to schools, it would maximise those resources and it would enhance inter-agency collaboration. Mental health and well-being in education spans many agencies, and there is a risk that without the assignation of responsibility and without a co-ordination body, this will fall between stools. This is something about which the coalition is very concerned. I wish to address the final areas of teacher training and a roadmap for schools. Teacher training is an issue that has been raised. I would like to acknowledge the excellent work that the SPHE support service, NEPS and the HSE mental health promotion officers do in terms of providing training. Studies have shown that training in terms of mental health is patchy and inconsistent around the country. The resources of the SPHE support service, the HSE mental health promotion officers and NEPS are not sufficient to provide training on the scale that is needed to implement these guidelines. The coalition in its submission recommended that there should be initial teacher education and continuous professional development on mental health awareness and that this training should include how to recognise when a child or young person is in distress. It should be the responsibility of all teachers to understand and recognise needs in this area to feed into the whole-school approach. The coalition recommended that this should included in training for teachers at all levels, from preschool up to third level. We also stressed the importance of social and emotional learning for very young children in our submission.It is important that the upskilling and training of teachers is not a one-off occurrence because research shows that it is important to the development of teacher competencies that one does not restrict it solely to training. Extensive evidence supports the need for coaching and feedback to realise the implementation of effective practices in the classroom. Again, we think there are great opportunities in terms of initial teacher training but also in the development of CPD. Within the guidelines there is reference to training that is available in mental health but no specific training has been designed for the implementation of the guidelines. That leads me to the roadmap for schools in terms of implementing the whole-school approach. While we welcome the guidelines, in many ways the implementation of the whole-school approach is complex. It seeks to make changes in the social and learning environment, strengthen the structures of each school for addressing mental health promotion and promote links between the school and the community. We agree that it takes great commitment from the school and there is a need for school leadership, but we feel that the guidelines are not specific enough in providing the roadmap. The groups Jigsaw and Headstrong are present today. A whole-school approach to mental health in schools has been put in place by Jigsaw in a small number of schools around the country and its model provides an example of a framework for putting in place a whole-school approach to mental health, as well as the kind of integration of services that is required and the supports that are necessary for schools to successfully implement it. While the guidelines do endorse a whole-school approach, we feel that the roadmap in those guidelines is not sufficiently clear or easy to put in place without those crucial supports for schools to ensure its implementation. We have people present who can answer questions on what is involved. My final point relates to the guidelines for primary schools. The guidelines that have been produced relate only to post-primary schools. The coalition considers it crucial that guidelines on mental health and social and emotional well-being are introduced from preschools right up to the third level sector. At primary school level this kind of training is often referred to as social and emotional learning. These are critical competencies. They involve skills that help children to calm themselves when angry, to initiate friendships and to resolve conflicts respectfully. At primary school level there is widespread evidence that this kind of social and emotional development has a significant impact on a child’s ability to engage with and adapt to the demands of school. Ms McClorey from Young Ballymun can tell members a bit more about the situation. Through the support of Young Ballymun, a number of primary schools in the area have implemented a whole-school approach to social and emotional learning. It is done through multi-level Incredible Years initiatives with teachers but also with children and parent components within it. The independent research recently published by Young Ballymun demonstrates significant improvements in the social and emotional well-being of children. A critical dimension to the success achieved in Ballymun is through the whole-school approach to children's social and emotional development based on the implementation of the evidence-based social and emotional learning, SEL, curriculum. It has been integrated in the classroom through management strategies embedded in the delivery of the parent programmes and community organisations. Such an ethos requires support structures. We recommend that the Department seek to put guidelines in place at primary level.

I accept reference has been made to the integration of services. Is there a signal that progress is about to be made in that regard, or are people waiting to hear when the new director for mental health is appointed whether real attention will be given to the area? What lessons have emerged from the recent projects supported by Headstrong? I did some work with Headstrong and consulted Tony Bates and Orlaith Foley prior to developing the party's policy. We need to have such a model around the country. If we had such services then schools would know how much could be done in the school setting to support children with low-level problems and to create a good environment, normalise talk about positive mental health and get rid of the stigma surrounding mental health issues. We must ensure there are proper community supports with the assistance of projects such as Jigsaw. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, must be accessible. That is where the big gap appears to be at the moment. I understand children can wait for up to a year for an appointment with a psychologist with CAMHS. What lessons were learned from the Headstrong initiative in terms of getting integrated services working locally? How did Headstrong get around the challenges and how can we roll out a model around the country? It would be useful to hear from Ms McClorey about Young Ballymun because it relates to a big gap that exists. It is all very well to intervene with a teenager from the age of 12 upwards but, as was correctly pointed out, problems develop much earlier than that - at preschool and primary level - so it is important that we hear that perspective. I will conclude with a suggestion. It was useful to have the officials from the Department of Education and Skills present but it would probably be more useful for the committee to meet with officials from the Department of Health. The Vice Chairman alluded to this point also. The gap is with regard to the psychological services, as the behavioural aspect of the issue is not covered by the Department of Education and Skills. I would like the committee to arrange a meeting with officials from the Department of Health as a matter of priority.

Teachers are not immune to economic pressures or to mental health issues. They are being asked to do more with less. How will that affect their ability to implement guidelines and roll out programmes? I accept a whole-school approach is required but there will be a significant focus on the role of teachers in identifying problems and providing early intervention. Given the pressure the members of the ASTI are under, how will that affect the implementation of the guidelines across the board?

I did not know they were in the gallery when I spoke about the project earlier. Is any of the €34 million set aside for mental health services by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, directed to the Jigsaw project?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	63	I might address the involvement of the Department of Health. There has not yet been an announcement on the directorate. An interdepartmental committee was involved with the development of the guidelines but it is notable that the Department of Health officials were from the health promotion section. There was no HSE or CAMHS involvement in the drafting of the guidelines. I am sure the HSE was consulted but there was no official consultation with CAMHS or the specialist CAMHS advisory group. We raised the issue previously. As was said earlier about the Special Education Support Service, more could be done in terms of collaboration between the Departments of Health and Education and Skills on the issue. Liaison is of key importance. The new child and family support agency in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has a major role to play in terms of mental health and education. The issue must be cross-departmental for it to work. I will hand over to Ms Neary to respond to questions on Headstrong, Jigsaw and funding.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	64	In terms of the lessons learned, the Jigsaw Meath schools model represents the bringing together of health and education and is an example of how that works. It is about building the capacity of the entire school to be a more supportive environment, which aligns itself to the whole-school approach and buys very much into it. In doing that it creates awareness around the schools of where young people can seek help, normalising that and making it okay to seek help. They know the support exists within the school from the HSE primary care psychologists, NEPS and SPHE support services. All of those services have been brought together to work in an integrated and concentrated way. Perhaps Ms Clarke wishes to add to what I have said.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	65	As regards lessons that have been learned, when I read the guidelines I realised that the work Jigsaw has done in County Meath proves that they will work.However, a great deal of effort and energy went into the past three years of Jigsaw Meath to get it up and running and to integrate the services. Jigsaw Meath came out of the tragedy in a small town in County Meath where there was a cluster of suicides in 2005 and 2006. I was a guidance counsellor in a school at that time. A number of other suicides occurred also, and there was a great fear that the number of suicides would escalate. The Health Service Executive was wonderful. Its personnel came into the school and helped us. From that day on we knew we could work together in a collaborative way. I was the guidance counsellor and the psychologists were able to work with me to screen out children who were at risk, and I was able to have a direct referral route from the school into the services of the HSE. It all started in 2006, and the project got moving in 2007. It has been developing, and bringing psychologists into the school to consult with staff members has shown that the guidelines will work. In terms of the way Jigsaw Meath works, we have two essential structures in the schools. We have an adolescent health team, which consists of two pupils, two parents, management of the school, the social, personal and health education, SPHE, teacher, the guidance counsellor, and one or two other teachers or year heads if they are interested and available to take part. That is the overarching group, which does an analysis of what each school needs in terms of mental health and identifying the difficulties. It can then put in place measures which will help a particular school for that particular year. It is self-evaluation in the school. That is at one level. At another level in the school there is a Jigsaw care team. Did I mention that psychologists are on the adolescent health team as well? On the care team, the psychologists come into the school and sit with the teachers, the guidance counsellor, the SPHE teacher and the special needs teachers. They are able to discuss students who have particular difficulties and therefore can obtain consultation and help. That gives the staff confidence. We are able to work together in a professional way and therefore we can decide on the children who need to be referred outside the school or what we can do within the school to help those children. We can bring in the entire staff in terms of making changes and observing or improving on behaviours. It is a whole integrated approach. The psychologist comes into the school and helps the staff. That is what we have found. When I read the guidelines I could not believe they were so close in many ways. Jigsaw Meath proves that the guidelines will work, but only with resources. Jigsaw Meath is currently working on goodwill. I am working in a voluntary capacity. The schools do not have any extra money. Counselling will be needed more frequently because it is obvious to me that if all the staff are working with the students and identifying students who have problems, those children will need help, but the average teacher does not have time to sit down and give them an hour of their time to discuss issues. The staff try to listen and give them time, but we need more counselling rather than less because the more distress one picks up in the school, the more help is required. Before children are referred out, we need proper evaluations and counselling within the school to see if a student can be helped in place.

Does Ms Leydon want to respond to that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	67	Deputy O'Brien's question was about capacity issues in the first instance and then about teachers and mental health. That is quite an issue that is emerging, but I will take the latter part last. I am very familiar with the work Jigsaw does, but every time I listen to its representatives I continue to be impressed in that we do have solutions to problems. The members are practical people. They are legislators, and they want solutions. They do not want a critique of what is wrong but to get good guidance on what might work from people like us who are on the ground. Capacity is extremely problematic. Putting on my ASTI hat, this day next week at our conference we will launch the third survey in a row of cutbacks in schools. Schools have an average loss of 2.1 subject teachers. To put that in context, as every subject teacher covers 33 children, if a school loses two teachers, 66 children have to be sorted out. Those 66 children cannot be parked during the day. They have to be dealt with, and our survey will show how that can be done. What I am saying is that the entire thrust of the guidelines is the whole-school approach, but when we have loss of capacity whereby teaching staff are removed from the school, the capacity is severely impaired. The first message I would give members as legislators is that they must protect the funding for education. It is essential that in the next budget funding for education is not reduced in any way. I would always make the case that it should be enhanced, but it must be protected because if schools lose another teacher, they will be at their wits' end. They are at their wits' end already in terms of providing the curriculum, not to mention implementing these profound approaches to societal problems such as well-being. Regarding the other suggestion I would make, I was interested to hear Senator Moran mention funding for third level. That is something on which the committee should pick up. In the coming year, the Teaching Council, the regulatory body for the teaching profession, will introduce a framework for continuing professional development, CPD. What that means is that there will be mandatory upskilling for teachers on an annual basis. What constitutes upskilling will be worked out, but there will be a huge demand for the relevant courses to be made available to those in the profession. One of the problems currently is that apart from the SPHE support service, which does not get enough funding anyway, there is not much alternative training.  I suggest that members work to protect the budget for education, make sure the third level institutions get funding to allow them provide courses to upskill teachers, and be aware that online training is not sufficient. It must be backed up by face-to-face peer coaching and mentoring. The other practical point raised by Deputy Butler, a fellow Trim citizen, was that board of management training is critical. The ASTI had discussions with the departmental team and it is putting together the guidelines. Regardless of the initiative we examine in schools, the Achilles heel of those initiatives is the board of management. The Department is quick to say we have autonomous boards of management which are ultimately accountable, but sometimes they are the people who know least about what is supposed to be happening and do not have the required skills. They have a lot of goodwill and community and other expertise, but they do not know the ins and outs of these matters. Speaking practically, the members should say that in the education budget the management bodies should be given money to provide training for boards of management. That is critical. I am conscious that other people wish to speak, but I want to make a final point. There are positives. We have a big reform agenda in education. It is not easy for teachers. There are dimensions of it with which the ASTI in particular would have issues, but it is a reform agenda that is creating capacity for these type of changes. For example, we now have school self-evaluation, and the Department must be commended on taking a "slowly, slowly" approach rather than a stick-based accountability approach. Over time, school self-evaluation will develop schools' capacity for self-reflection in terms of asking how they are doing and whether they are doing something well, which was mentioned earlier in respect of the excellent school with which I am very familiar. It is about bringing all those people together and being able to do things in a coherent fashion. The school self-evaluation measures will support that. We must be positive. It is the members' job as legislators to help bring this country back to some degree of decency of lifestyle and prosperity. It is important that we give people positive messages about what they can do, but the most important aspect is to protect the capacity of schools to do what they are doing and to ensure further cuts are not imposed. That is the fundamental message. With regard to the question on teachers' mental health, I am always reluctant to talk about this because teachers are leaders and professionals whose job it is to care for children. However, there are incredible stresses, including financial, on teachers these days. A teacher to whom I spoke yesterday told me that while she would like to upskill and do a master's she cannot afford to do so because her husband is unemployed and one of her children is currently at college. These are the type of stresses about which I am sure members are hearing at their constituency offices. We are lucky in Ireland in that we have an incredibly dedicated teaching force at primary and secondary levels.

I must be fair to everybody. I call Ms McClorey.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	73	I was struck by the submission, Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools - Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention. Well-being in post primary schools will be built on the well-being of children coming into that sector. One cannot separate out a child of 12 or 13 years moving to second level and expect his or her well-being to be any better than it is as they cross that threshold.  Much of the focus of Young Ballymun has been on developing two key strategies, one of which is an infant mental health strategy in partnership with the HSE and CAMHS for children 0-3 years and their parents. The notion of inviting health officials to address the committee is interesting. This issue is hugely relevant for children and families. As we all know, the intersection between health and education is artificial at family or child level. These services are all integrated around the child and the family. One might ask why the 0-3 years period is critical to secondary school. Parental attachment, attunement processes and the pre-language development, brain development and social and emotional competences of a young child provide the foundation for the development of every other effort of the child, his or her parents and the teachers and community organisations around them. This is intimately connected with the issues confronting secondary schools and the strategies required to be designed to respond to them. On our implementation of the Incredible Years programme across primary schools in Ballymun, the independent evaluation is available on our website. There have been two key outcomes, namely, parental depression and stress levels reduced significantly from levels of clinical concern to within normal mental health boundaries and, for children, there were significantly increased pro-social behaviours and a marked decrease in hyperactivity combined with decreases in emotional and conduct problems. As those members who were formerly teachers will know all of these gains for children and parents are intrinsically linked to their educational attainment. Also important is parental well-being and the ability, confidence and competence to manage the secondary school development of one's child. As a parent who has completed that journey I know that building an effective relationship with one's child in adolescence is difficult. It is a time when naturally parent-child and young person-teacher communications can be strained and complex but is a normal pathway of development. The strength or otherwise of the bonds, attachments and communications that we developed with our children in their much earlier stages of development carries most of us through to adulthood. The role of the parent in whole-school strategies is also important. The World Health Organization whole-school approach also underpinned our work with primary schools in Ballymun. Parents are a key element of a whole-school approach. Building the competence and capacities of teachers is also essential. Children's self-regulatory, self-expressive and self-awareness capacities are at the core of mental health and well-being. Parents can be so easily left out of this loop from birth onwards. It can all be about the child or other people. The parent is the primary promoter and protector of the child's welfare and mental health and development. Investing in parental awareness skills, knowledge and understanding is important. I was struck by Deputy Butler's observation in regard to his role on the school management committee in certain situations. I identify with that. I am sure members will identify with parents being traumatised by their inability to respond to their children's needs.

What in the delegates' experience are the biggest challenges for children in the care system accessing education? I refer in this regard not to the emotional challenges but to the practical difficulties such as enrolment in schools and so on? Have the delegates pitched the paper which they sent to the Department of Education and Skills on focus on the primary system? I understand that 40% of our teachers currently come from Hibernia College. Have the delegates considered putting some of their proposals to it. Given it is responsible for training 40% of our teachers I believe it would be open to meeting with them.

Was any of the additional €34 million for mental health projects directed towards this project?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	77	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	79	Absolutely not. The Children's Mental Health Coalition received its funding from Amnesty International's mental health campaign. We are not funded by government in any way. Jigsaw may have received funding. I do not know if Headstrong received funding from the additional €34 million allocation. I can, however, say that the €34 million was not spent in that year. There was a net reduction in mental health spending in 2012. In reality, the ring-fencing of that budget has not happened on the ground.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	83	On teacher training, we have made recommendations to the Department around development of teacher training, particularly continuous professional development. In terms of children in care, the Children's Mental Health Coalition is currently conducting research on the mental health needs of children in the care and youth justice system, which is due to be published in May. I do not have specific expertise in terms of access to education for children in care. On Senator Power's points in regard to implementation of the guidelines, it is crucial that mental health and well-being within schools is dealt with at senior level within the Department of Education and Skills. It is also crucial this is the case within the new directorate of mental health and that a national policy on inter agency work is developed. There must be national coherence even though things differ on the ground locally. Also, the liaison role in terms of implementing the guidelines would be a sensible use of scarce resources.Just to add, in regard to relevant legislation, the Children First legislation being developed and also the legislation underpinning the new child and family support agency, it is critically important that access to education services and care is debated and that the work is underpinned by a legislative framework.

Ms Róisín Webb talked about the care for the children, and I admire the work going on in Jigsaw, in Meath, but it goes back to Deputy Butler's point. In terms of mental health, if the teacher is involved in a dreadful situation that arises, there are no supports. As mentioned, sometimes they do not have the money to pay €100 for a psychologist and they may feel that the child is being looked after, the school has its policy, but what supports are in place for the teacher?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	88	That liaison office would be a huge support to teachers as well because in terms of that whole-school approach, it is the responsibility of the schools to figure out all of those referral processes and implement that without having access to the support they need. That would be crucial for teachers as well as the students.

This is an issue we will have to come back to. From a school perspective, the various agencies they must deal with and the responsibilities that come under Departments, be it Health, Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs or whatever, is frustrating. We will send on the presentations to the Minister for Education and Skills but we will ask Department of Health officials to appear before the committee to give us more insight into how we can overcome the difficulties. I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations. I am sorry the time was short but we got a huge amount from the presentations. We will suspend briefly while the next witnesses come in. I ask members to remain if they possibly can do so because those making the next presentation have been waiting two hours.

By virtue of section 17(2)(l ) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise that the opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Mr. John Church to make his opening remarks. I apologise for the delay in taking the presentation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	93	We are here to speak about musculoskeletal disease which is the comprehensive term that includes symptoms such as chronic back pain and conditions such as arthritis and particularly to speak about increasing the participation of people with MSDs, musculoskeletal disorders, in the workplace and in everyday life. This has very important implications for competitiveness, jobs, economic performance, Exchequer finances as well as for the well-being and life satisfaction of MSD sufferers. The potential savings arising from the coherent programme which we will outline are of the order of €250 million, therefore this is not trivial. This is in the same ballpark as the estimate for the local property tax this year. We are concerned here with an issue that is potentially extremely important. That estimate does not include all the personal and economic benefits that would accrue from people with MSDs who, unfortunately, in many instances find themselves out of the workforce far too early and the benefits that would accrue to them if they were able to remain in the workforce. Our colleagues are Mr. John Church, chief executive of Arthritis Ireland who will open the presentation, Dr. Robert Ryan, occupational physician who represents the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland and Professor Oliver FitzGerald, a consultant rheumatologist at St. Vincent's Hospital and the lead on MSDs in the HSE.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	94	Thank you Dr. Thornhill and members of the committee. In the interests of time I have left some of the slides to the background. Ireland is one of 24 countries that took part in a survey that looked at musculoskeletal diseases, following which we formed a coalition of key stakeholders and interested parties. At the back of the slides members will see that we have assembled some key stakeholders from various sectors, physicians and allied help professionals such as the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, employers represented by IBEC, employees represented by ICTU, health insurers, HSE as policy makers and patient groups. We have a good broad representation. This is not a disability lobby. We are not here to plea to save HSE money, but to present a solution to a significant problem which will save the Exchequer significant funds and we are seeking a champion within the House to take this on. We are calling for support to establish a cross-departmental group to work with the coalition on this issue. Dr. Thornhill outlined the potential savings, a sum of €250 million.That is one third of the total bill the Minister pays out in illness benefit every year. In fact, if we put in place a solution for MSDs, we would also address every other illness. Therefore, the potential pot at issue is bigger and the amount paid out each year could be up to €940 million. I will take the committee through the report findings. One significant finding is that MSDs are the most commonly reported cause of work-related ill-health in Ireland. The total cost to the Exchequer is €750 million per year or 7 million lost working days per annum. Of the figure of €750 million, more than €250 million is spent on illness benefit - that is to say, almost one third of the bill is spent on illness benefit related to MSDs. The condition accounts for twice the number of days lost through stress. We know from our research that 25% of people with rheumatoid arthritis stop work within five years of the first symptoms. There is critical data indicating the prevalence of MSDs as a significant issue. The average duration of illness benefit payment is 11 weeks, but for MSDs the duration is twice that, at 22 weeks. We also know that one third of all recipients of illness benefit payments migrate to long-term disability benefit payment, which is another pot of €640 million. It is fair to conclude that MSDs must be a part of that figure of €640 million. At this stage, the committee will be beginning to understand the significant savings that could be achieved by addressing this issue. According to the Institute of Public Health in Ireland, 12% of all adults have been clinically diagnosed with a MSD and that figure will rise to 13% in the coming ten years. Interestingly, when we compare Ireland with the other 23 countries that took part in the research, we find our contribution or our bill relating to illness benefit is 30% of the total, whereas in the rest of Europe it is 50%. I suggest we have a window of opportunity if we act now. Currently, we have no national policy on intervention or integration between the health services, employer and employee. If we simply address this issue there are potential savings, and not only for the Exchequer. This is an investment for the employer and it is also an investment in the well-being of the employee. The report recommendations call for early and proactive intervention by the employer but also by a case manager. My colleague, Dr. Robert Ryan, will go into this in more detail. The ethos of what we are discussing is a focus on the capacity of the employee and not on incapacity. With that in mind, we advocate considering a phased return to work. We are also keen to address imaginative job design, which is central to rehabilitation. This relates to the physical layout of workstations, flexible working times and so on. We are also calling for health professionals to consider work as a clinical outcome. This means they should consider the patient before them as an employee who may wish to and have to return to work. The idea is to consider how quickly the patient can get back to work as a clinical outcome. There are plenty of case histories showing the benefit of early intervention and why it works. Most of the data is from outside Ireland but there are some Irish examples as well, which we will go into. Generally, most companies in our research have absenteeism rates of less than 3%. The IBEC report gives a rate of between 1.6% and 3.7%, and the public sector rates run on average at 4.9%, but with some sites reporting absenteeism of 7% across large employee bases. Given the significant employee numbers at issue, even a 1% reduction in absenteeism could have a significant impact on illness benefit payments, which are a cost to the Exchequer. It would have a significant effect on employer productivity and, naturally, on employee well-being. I will leave most of the examples to my colleague, Dr. Robert Ryan. There are some significant examples to show why we should do this quickly. I will hand the committee over to Professor Oliver FitzGerald, who will go through a short piece on MSDs.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	95	What are MSDs? MSDs include, most commonly, regional musculoskeletal pain. The patients who present are people who complain of back pain, work-related upper limb disorders and hip and knee pain. It is remarkably common, with virtually all people experiencing an episode of musculoskeletal pain during their lifetime. The second commonest condition is osteoarthritis, which is estimated to affect more than 500,000 people in Ireland. This is followed by rheumatoid arthritis, a condition the committee will have heard of. It is a severe deforming arthropathy that affects up to 40,000 people in the country. Children can be affected by arthritis and an estimated 1,000 children are affected in Ireland. Finally, spondyloarthropathy is a group of disorders commonly involving the spine and the joints outside the spine. It includes conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Broadly speaking, these are the diseases under discussion and, in each case, early intervention is central. Early intervention has been shown to result in better health outcomes, prevention of joint damage and preservation of function, including ability to work. It has been shown that the longer a patient is out of work with a MSD, the less likely he will be able to return to work. For example, if a person is out of work with back pain for more than a year, the chances of his returning to work are negligible. Many of these patients are referred to rheumatology and orthopaedic outpatient services. Unfortunately, there are lengthy waiting lists for such services throughout the country. The waiting list is up to three years in some units, and many of these people are sitting on waiting lists. Last year, the HSE rheumatology and orthopaedic programmes appointed 24 highly trained specialist musculoskeletal physiotherapists. During 2012 more than 10,000 patients with regional musculoskeletal pain were seen by these physiotherapists and diagnosed and treated. Fewer than 20% of those patients needed to see a consultant - they could be managed effectively by the physiotherapist - and fewer than 10% required surgical intervention. We estimate that in 2013 a further 24,000 patients will be removed from the orthopaedic and rheumatology outpatient waiting lists. In time we expect that the rheumatology and orthopaedic outpatient waiting lists will become more manageable and that physiotherapists will be able to work more at the interface between primary and secondary care. This will allow us to address some of the issues related to regional musculoskeletal pain in a more expedient manner. Across the spectrum of health in both primary and secondary care, we need to target getting back to work as a clinical outcome. That is something we need to focus on.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	96	I am a working occupational physician. I see cases in which these medical problems arise in employment and I am involved in managing them. My task in this case was to determine whether there were examples in my practice that might give a tangible sense to committee members of the potential outcomes. In a general sense we are looking at better health outcomes for employees, but part of the process will involve an earlier return to work and substantial cost savings. I have referenced several examples to demonstrate our point. Our role with the Dublin Airport Authority included work on an absence management programme and an early intervention programme for musculoskeletal injuries. The idea was that we would see staff members at an early opportunity when they became unwell. The programme resulted in a 25% reduction in overall absence and a 62% reduction in long-term absences, which were rather significant savings. Another project that allowed us to monitor the effect of intervention by an occupational health service involved the Department of Education and Skills. We introduced the first national occupational health service for teachers and special needs assistants. A review at the end of the first period indicated that levels of absence due to sickness had been reduced by 17% - that is, by 70,000 teacher days per annum. This benefit represented a 12-fold return on the cost of the service merely through a reduction in substitute teaching costs and without counting any other benefits that might accrue. In the next phase of our project with the Department of Education and Skills, the referral point will come down from 12 weeks to four weeks. We have introduced a team of case managers who make contact with teachers and special needs assistants who are out of work and assist them in managing the condition as well as assisting the school in managing their medical complaints and absences. My expectation is that the reduction in absence we realised in the first phase of the service will be augmented by our earlier intervention. A well-documented example outside our jurisdiction is that of the Royal Mail in the UK, which introduced more active management not only of MSDs but of all health-related issues that resulted in work absence. Over a three-year period, its level of absence decreased from 7% to 4.5%, resulting in savings of £270 million against an outlay of £46 million. There are examples that demonstrate that early intervention using occupational health measures not only is good for the employees but should result in significant savings for the employer and perhaps the State. The solution is to introduce nationally agreed standards for early intervention, developed by the Fit for Work coalition, under the auspices of the HSE. Ideally, intervention should be carried out as early as possible, perhaps as early as day five, by an occupational health team. The best way to achieve this is to establish a national case management system to facilitate early intervention. Large companies may be able to resource that within their existing occupational health services, but smaller companies should have access to outsourced case management services. The case manager is the link between the employee, the employer and the health professionals providing care to the individual. We also propose that we need a dialogue with general practitioners and to develop guidelines with the Irish College of General Practitioners in the area of sick certification to extend the usefulness of this and its role within the terms of rehabilitation and return to work. The coalition believes that a cross-departmental approach is necessary to implement the Fit for Work programme, and it is suggested that a high-level appointment would allow policy to be effected at a national level.

Committee members will pose questions, but there are no representatives of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or the Technical Group here. How were the figures of €750 million a year for 7 million lost working days and €280 million spent on illness benefit arrived at?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	98	We were one of 24 countries that took part in this research, which was done by a London-based organisation called the Work Foundation. The research was desk-based and studied the same data in each country. The €750 million was grossed up based on the payment of illness benefit, the cost to the employer, lost productivity and the cost of having to redeploy or get locum or other cover for employees who were out sick. Of that sum, we have lately focused on illness benefit payment, which is a real source of data from the Department of Social Protection. They are real figures.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	100	Professor FitzGerald is better placed to talk about that, but that is why we are calling for early intervention. The average payment to an employee who is out of work with a MSD is 22 weeks, versus the overall average of 11 weeks. Those figures come from the Department of Social Protection. It is unacceptable to leave somebody out for 22 weeks. If one intervenes extremely early one could prevent long-term disability and damage.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	102	Yes; that was what the report found. There are multiple exercises, and some companies would back that up. The HSE report of November 2009 cites MSDs as the biggest cause of workplace absenteeism.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	103	The social protection costs are considerable but, side by side with them, from the point of view of the Exchequer, come losses in income tax revenue, universal social charge revenue, PRSI and reduced consumer expenditure because of the income hit that households take. The effects of this are quite profound.

The more I read about this, the more I feel he should really be speaking to the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Perhaps we can put in a request to that effect. Our remit here is education and, particularly in this case, social protection. I am interested in the phrase "create a fit note". Could Dr. Ryan please elaborate on that? What exactly is he saying? Does it refer to when a person has been out sick but is now ready to go back to work or can work only part-time?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	105	It may give the GP an opportunity, rather than calling it black or white - fit or unfit - to qualify that by saying what the person would be capable of doing and what he or she could not do, so that an employer could work with that or make an accommodation that would surmount the barriers to a return to work that the GP has identified.
#MarieMoloney	unknown-#MarieMoloney-party	unknown-#MarieMoloney-dob	unknown-#MarieMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	106	That in itself would cause a lot of problems within the Department of Social Protection, because it is easier for it to say one is fit or unfit. It has introduced a partial capacity scheme whereby people can return to work and retain their social welfare payments, which is along the lines of what Dr. Ryan has described. It would probably need to last longer than ten weeks or so. Is Dr. Ryan aware of that scheme?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	107	There is social welfare certification but there is also certification between the GP and the employer, which allows a dialogue to take place, particularly if there is a case manager as the link person between the employee, the employer and the doctors looking after the patient. This would give an opportunity to explore the boundaries, limitations or blocks on both sides. For the individual it would be a question of what he or she is capable or not capable of doing, but the case manager would also engage with the employer, asking whether it can work with this person who is not fit to carry out all the duties he or she used to perform but is fit for, say, eight of the ten duties. The employer might be able to provide the individual with a slightly altered role while he or she is rehabilitated. It is really a question of communicating with the employee, the employer and the doctors to help a person get back to work sooner.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	108	I thank the Senator for the invitation. We intend to speak to everybody. This is a health issue but we also see it as a cross-departmental issue. The €750 million includes a health element, but I think the committee will agree that there is a significant bill for the Department of Social Protection, and we propose a solution to save money for the Exchequer.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	109	I thank the gentlemen for their presentation, which I found very interesting. I have suffered from various muscular problems throughout my life. In respect of early intervention, it is very difficult for a GP or physiotherapist to diagnose the problem at the start and to get a picture of it. When I was X-rayed I was told I had a virus. I had muscular problems in my legs. I now have a touch of arthritis in my hip, which will have to be replaced. At times I was very frustrated because the physiotherapy did not work. Then I had a problem in my back and went to a chiropractor, who sorted out my back up to a point. When I was told I had fallen arches, I spent a lot of money buying special shoes and getting physiotherapy for that problem, which was a total waste of time. I am sceptical about the suggestion that it is possible to come up with a national solution to the problem, because it is a long road and many problems will arise. The real problem is getting the final diagnosis. One will find out only by trial and error. It was very frustrating going to different GPs and consultants and so on.We all know the one shoe will not fit in all cases. With regard to health and safety, does sending back to work somebody whose arm, leg or hip functions, for example, are not 100% not result in insurance problems? It would be very problematic to come up with a national solution. I speak from my experience of having been to doctors, consultants and various practices.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	110	Many people have experienced the frustration that Deputy Butler described. The journey for patients with various musculoskeletal complaints is often frustrating and they end up being sent in a variety of directions without a diagnosis or treatment that will address the problem. A number of solutions are being proposed. The one that I am most familiar with – intervention by very highly-trained musculoskeletal physiotherapists – involves being seen by someone who is very highly trained in musculoskeletal disease. This is very different from the experience described by the Deputy. Experience working with the therapists, both in Ireland and abroad, has shown that they are more than capable of making a good diagnosis and establishing a good treatment plan. It is critical that this be achieved as early as possible.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	111	I found that once one was paying, there were potential solutions for everything but that they were not solving the problem. I found that one had to keep persevering and that the process was never-ending. I am very happy to hear the practitioners in question will be qualified. I believed the people I was dealing with were qualified-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	112	These are specialists.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	113	Yes.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	114	There is sufficient capacity to have a national system. With regard to the education sector, which has 4,000 schools spread across the country, there is intervention and the relevant period is to be reduced to four weeks. Therefore, it is possible to create a system of national intervention. It sounds like Deputy Butler had a very difficult experience and possibly a complicated pathway. Not every difficult case will be managed easily or readily but many cases could be managed. If I, as an occupational physician, see someone on behalf of his employer, I do not take over his care or take ownership of everything to do with his health. I work with the individual to determine what I can do to assist with his rehabilitation and the return to work. It is a case of there being an interface between the individual and employer. Despite early intervention, there will be those who continue to remain unfit for work and who will have difficult, complex medical problems. Across the board, however, the biggest cohort will have more simple problems in respect of which early intervention and working with the employer will be effective, not only for the individual but also in terms of the capacity to return to work.

The delegation has outlined a particular problem and the figures are very stark. I am impressed by the wide coalition of employers, unions, experts, patient organisations, etc. Has the potential solution been costed? Knowing the cost could determine policymakers' reaction to it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	116	I will attempt to answer that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	118	Absolutely. This is obviously a matter that we have considered. We have examined all the case studies and histories. Each one represents a net gain. Currently, nothing is happening with intervention. There is an intervention cost and we have examined it. The reason we have included employers and employees, as pointed out by the Vice Chairman, is so we can discuss these issues. Clearly, there is a desire not to burden employers any further. Private health insurers are also part of the coalition. There are solutions and we are working on them. Dr. Ryan would be working on similar solutions. We are trying to weigh the benefit of bringing somebody back to work early against the cost. The model we are working on at present is based on a cost per head, which could very well be absorbed into a company's health insurance policy. There may be some costs for the employer. We are discussing this with IBEC. Ultimately, we see this as an investment, not a cost. It is an investment in the employers' businesses.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	119	Is there potential to go from public sector department to public sector department initially? It was stated large corporations might be better resourced to roll out the model before the establishment of a national plan. Could this approach be considered first?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	120	Yes. We realise Ireland is different from some of the other countries. I understand approximately 50% of our employers are small to medium-sized enterprises that would not be able to afford in-house occupational health services. Clearly, we are working on a solution for them. Perhaps Dr. Robert Ryan can elaborate on the arrangements already in place. Ideally, every employer should have some sort of case manager or primary care facility into which it can tap in the event of an employee being unfit to work.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	121	I am satisfied that there is an investment. Where we have considered the cost of intervention versus the yield, we have noted that there is a significant yield in monetary and other terms. In a year, I will be curious to know what the difference will mean in regard to education and the reduction of the threshold of referral from 12 weeks to four weeks. I believe it will make a significant difference. At present, there are large public sector employers and other large employers that have occupational health services. They probably have the capacity to introduce the sorts of measures in question because they have sufficient resources. The SME sector does not. It is not just a question of cost as it is also a question of the practicality, feasibility and availability of a programme.

I apologise for my having to leave for part of the presentation but I have been looking over what I missed. There is much merit in what the delegates are saying. They are certainly talking sense. Is there an international example of where the proposed solution, the case manager system, is working? If so, what evidence has been gleaned from such an example?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	123	It is a widely used model outside Ireland. Once one starts to intervene early, one is actually increasing the number of people with whom one will engage. It is simply not practical for everyone to see a doctor. The case manager represents a means of assessing people early and triaging them. It is a case of differentiating between the forms of intervention that are appropriate for particular groups. The model is such that some may be directed towards a doctor, some towards an occupational health nurse and others towards physiotherapy or occupational therapy. The model in the United Kingdom involves case management which escalates to referral to a nurse, doctor, physiotherapist or occupational therapist while linking in with the employer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	124	We know from the 24 other countries that took part in the survey, including Spain, that there are countries introducing the model. Belgium is a good example.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	126	Yes, we have. We briefed the Minister, Deputy Burton, on our introduction to her office two years ago. I am planning to meet her on 23 April and she is also opening our Fit for Work forum, which is a national forum we are running on 24 April. We intend to make various representations across Departments, including the Department of Health.

Even the previous presentation would have gone between committees dealing with health, children and education. However, Mr. Church is here from the social protection viewpoint and is focusing on those savings. Are there any further comments in summary?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	128	I wish to thank you, Vice Chairman, and other members of the joint committee who, I know, have had a long afternoon. Incidentally, Professor FitzGerald had to get back to a clinic in St. Vincent's Hospital. I think the Vice Chairman was aware of that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	130	This has been a useful experience for us. It has been useful to face the challenging questions coming from members of the committee. Implicit in the Vice Chairman's suggestion is the thought that developing experience through dealing with larger employments, first of all, seems to be a reasonable strategy. Many of the larger employments are of course public sector ones and, sadly, the rates of absenteeism in the public sector are about three times those in the private sector. There is potentially very productive territory for us to plough. Let us hope that when we are talking to the committee again we will have registered progress and will have more positive outcomes of the type that Dr. Ryan has just outlined concerning teachers.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-27 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	131	What helps Dr. Thornhill's case is that he has identified the problem. If this is the No. 1 reason why people are missing work, then obviously it is something that has to be corrected. All of us on this committee believe that early intervention is the key in most areas of policy. Dr. Thornhill has identified the costs. In his initial presentation he said he was looking for champions in this regard. A champion will always be asked the hard questions - for example, if one has a model for intervention how much will it cost? That body of work will have to be done in order to get the cost structure fine-tuned.  The suggestion of going Department by Department, sector by sector or through larger private sector entities first, is a good one. Dr. Thornhill said that having 50% of employees in small or medium-sized businesses might not necessarily be the way to go yet. I certainly think we should keep in contact with each other. We often have presentations here with a good engagement, but the relationship may not be built up or we do not come back to see where it has gone. After Dr. Thornhill has met the Minister and the conference has been held, perhaps he could communicate again with the committee. We will certainly circulate the presentation and post it on our website.  Anyone who has heard today's presentations will certainly be convinced by the validity of Dr. Thornhill's argument. I thank him and his colleagues for attending the committee.
