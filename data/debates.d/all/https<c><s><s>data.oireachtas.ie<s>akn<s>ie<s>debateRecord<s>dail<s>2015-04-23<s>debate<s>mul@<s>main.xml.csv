#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	I seek an update as to when EUROSTAT will come back to the Government with its proposals as to the funding model for Irish Water. I am conscious that the Government has based its plan on the premise that it will get the spending associated with Irish Water off-balance-sheet. The CSO recently adjudicated that it should be on-balance-sheet. The Government is paying 1.5 percentage points over the rate the NTMA is paying for borrowing on a regular basis.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I thank the Deputy.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	This not only defeats the purpose but also proves that, on-balance-sheet, the Government is paying 1.5 percentage points over the rate the NTMA is paying for regular borrowings on the part of the Government. When will EUROSTAT come back to the Government? Why has the delay arisen?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I thank the Deputy for his question. A key component of the strategy to establish Irish Water is that Irish Water will be classified as a market corporation under EUROSTAT rules and as a result will not, other than in relation to Government support, be included in the calculation of the general Government balance. The CSO is independent and is responsible for engagement with EUROSTAT on such matters. Officials from my Department have met officials from that office and have provided the necessary information to facilitate this work. Early engagement with that office by my Department centred on understanding the rules by which a utility such as Irish Water would be considered a market corporation. I went into that in great detail. Based on this understanding, the Government is confident that the underlying funding model for Irish Water supports increased investment in the water sector through an off-balance-sheet classification of the utility, while at the same time providing for water charges which are affordable, clear and certain.  The Government remains absolutely confident that Irish Water will pass the market corporation test. However, as it is independent, this is ultimately a matter for EUROSTAT. The CSO has confirmed that a classification proposal on Irish Water is currently with EUROSTAT. The CSO has further stated that this is a closed process and that it is awaiting EUROSTAT’s final adjudication, which I expect in a couple of months.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I accept the Minister's answer and hear what he is saying. Unfortunately, towards the end of last year we were informed that by February or March we would have a resolution to this issue and a decision by EUROSTAT. The Minister is obviously not aware of the reason for the delay because he believes the Government has adhered to all the rules. In the absence of legislation to give effect to stronger powers on the part of Irish Water to get payment from those who refuse to pay, when does the Minister expect to introduce legislation to give more powers to Irish Water in that regard? Is EUROSTAT awaiting the outcome of that process? Irish Water then will be perceived to have an absolute income stream, which is currently absent, in the form of adequate legislation to empower it to force people to pay, which goes against the commitment the Minister gave previously that no enforcement would be forthcoming in the form of turning off taps and so forth.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I thank the Deputy.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	That appears to be a gap in the Government's presentation to EUROSTAT. Also, the €100 grant is nothing more than a kickback, to use some of the language that has been expressed about other issues that have been discussed this week.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Sorry, Deputy. We are over time.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The €100 grant is very much welcomed by many people I have met in Offaly.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	It is to turn on the tap.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	There is no correlation between legislation proposed to be introduced in the very near future to address the issues he raised and EUROSTAT's decision. EUROSTAT is completely independent and deals with the CSO here in Ireland. When it makes its decision is a matter for that organisation. I cannot dictate; I can just give guidance in this House on what I expect to the best of my ability, as I have always done. Ultimately it is a matter for EUROSTAT as to when that decision is in place. There is no delay. This is a matter for EUROSTAT based on the information provided to it through the CSO. As I said, I expect that in a couple of months. I think it was the right decision-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	I thank the Minister.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	-----to ensure that people's taps could not be turned off. However, I expect legislation on enforcement mechanisms to be brought before the House in the coming weeks.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	Can the Minister confirm, and does he think it is ironic, that with regard to the borrowing of €300 million that Irish Water obtained in the markets at the end of last year, the rate it is paying - and, ultimately, that consumers will pay - is 2.5%? Is it the case that the rate at which the Government is borrowing on a regular basis through the NTMA is just 1%? Despite all that has been spent - some would say wasted - in getting us to this point, the consumer will be expected to pay 150% more than if it was on-balance-sheet and within general taxation.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	No; I do not think it is ironic at all. It is done with the best information available. Irish Water gets the best rates it can.It continues to consider various other ways of borrowing and is very close to some more success in that respect. Ultimately, we believe, Irish Water will be off-balance-sheet. It is absolutely necessary for Irish Water to be in a position to borrow at the scale required so that it can put over €6 billion into the network in the future to deal with all the issues concerning water of which this House is well aware, and the fact that it was not a priority for many Governments across parties in recent decades.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	My question is about the amount to be realised from domestic water charges and separately from commercial water charges. Earlier this year, Irish Water told me that it needed €899 million this year for operational costs. There seems to be a question about whether the sums will add up to that amount. Will the Minister address those two issues?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I thank the Deputy for the question. The establishment of Irish Water, which is an integral component of the Government’s water sector reform strategy, will lead to lower costs and improved services in the future, providing much better outcomes for customers and the environment. Irish Water is being funded by a combination of domestic and non-domestic water charges, Government support and the raising of debt on capital markets. The main aspects of the Irish Water funding model are set out in a detailed fact sheet published on my Department’s website. In 2015, Irish Water expects billed income from domestic customers to total €271 million and income from non-domestic customers to total some €229 million, giving a total billed income from customers of €500 million.  Government funding is by way of operational subvention, loans and capital contributions. Specifically, the Government will provide a €399 million operating subvention to Irish Water in 2015. This subvention will be paid in respect of the child allowance of 21,000 litres per child per annum, a product subsidy and the capping of domestic water charges at the rates set out in the Water Services Act 2014.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	I thank the Minister for his reply. At Question Time last month he told me the billed amount for domestic water would be €270 million. He also told me that in a written reply. That suggests that he is depending on a 100% compliance rate. He is correct in the sum that Irish Water quoted earlier in the year - €271 million in domestic charges and €229 million in commercial charges, giving €500 million. There will be an Exchequer subvention of €399 million for operational day-to-day costs, but that ignores the fact that there will be a substantial non-payment of these charges. I anxiously await the legislation which the Minister says he is bringing in soon. Ignoring the water conservation grant and assuming the Minister will do a smoke-and-mirrors job with that, there is a gap in collection because the commercial water rates collected were far lower in the last year for which there are figures.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	There will be no smoke and mirrors in any aspect of this or the water conservation grant. The domestic revenue to be delivered is €271 million. There will be several measures in place to enable people to pay, and they will be facilitated by flexi-pay options, etc. There will also be enforcement mechanisms in the legislation, which the Deputy awaits eagerly and which will be introduced in the coming weeks, to ensure that the €271 million will be delivered. We absolutely need that to happen and to ensure that everybody makes their contribution to the charges. The charges outlined are very fair and reasonable.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	What the Minister has just said conflicts with his reply during the previous Question Time. He said €271 million was the billed amount. He also said that in a written reply. That is for domestic water charges. The last year for which I can obtain figures for commercial water charges is 2012, when the amount realised was €180 million. The billed amount was €187 million. Local authorities were fairly effective in that year at collecting it. The shortfall between the billed amount and the amount yielded was only €7 million. If Irish Water hopes to get €229 million, there is a gap of €50 million. There will be a significant non-payment, regardless of whether the Minister agrees with that or not. The Minister does not and I do, but that is beside the point. There will be a shortfall of somewhere in excess of €100 million. Will Irish Water look for more money from the Exchequer and this House to make up the shortfall in operational costs? How will that shortfall be made up and will the Government meet the EUROSTAT test, which has been deferred yet again?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	The EUROSTAT decision has not been deferred. That is a matter for EUROSTAT. It is an independent body and its independence is critical and necessary. I just want to nail that one.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	It has been moved twice.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	That is a matter for EUROSTAT. It is not a matter for this Government. I hope the Deputy knows that. It is up to EUROSTAT to make its decisions. There will not be a shortfall in respect of the figures the Deputy quoted. Legislation on enforcement will be brought through the Houses to ensure that the income I stated, €500 million, will be delivered. I am very confident of that. I am also quite pleased at the number of people who, since the 361,000 bills were received around the country last Monday, signed up immediately. It shows that the people are coming with us and understand that it is absolutely necessary to go down this road.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	Figures were released earlier this week showing that there has been a disastrous 55% increase in the number of homeless families and children in the past year. Most of those are in Dublin - 911 children, or 411 families - on top of an already disastrous homelessness crisis in Dublin for individuals, families and young people. How can the Minister say he is taking serious action to deal with this crisis when what he promised goes nowhere near dealing with it, and the allocations he has made for new houses in Dublin are lower in percentage terms than the national average, according to his own figures?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I thank the Deputy sincerely for asking this question. Social housing is a key priority for the Government, and the social housing strategy targets the supply of 35,000 additional social housing units. I have managed to get €4 billion in the teeth of very difficult economic times. Even the Deputy, I hope, would acknowledge that that is a substantial amount of money to get in these difficult times. It is an absolute priority for me. The targets for local authorities that I announced recently are fully in line with those in the social housing strategy, which were developed having regard to the nature and scale of social housing need, as measured by the most recent statutory assessment of housing need. In total, some 22,900 units are targeted for delivery in the 2015-17 period, 7,500 through capital-funded schemes and 15,400 through current-funded programmes. A key reason for the variation in the impact on local housing lists lies in the variation in the levels of housing need locally. Certain areas have lower numbers on housing lists, with a consequence that the targets set for such authorities have a relatively high percentage impact on the lists. Conversely, while other authorities had considerably higher targets set for them, including the Dublin local authorities, the impact is proportionally not as high given the number on the housing lists of those areas. In overall terms, the targets I have announced for Dublin are extremely ambitious and challenging. I am determined that they will be achieved. Delivery on these targets will have a major impact on the housing waiting lists in the four local authorities concerned and reflect the fact that addressing social housing need is accorded the highest priority by the Government. In that regard, Dublin is ultimately the highest priority.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	For the third time since I entered the Dáil in 2011, I have brought families, who were directly affected, into the Visitors Gallery. They are either now homeless, threatened with homelessness or have been on the housing waiting list for ten, 12 or 13 years. Many of them now sitting in the Visitors Gallery are in absolutely dire circumstances. The figures released today by the Dublin Housing Executive show that the situation has become worse by 55% in the last year, despite all the announcements. Frankly, somebody is telling porkies about these figures. When the Minister says there is €3.8 billion extra it sounds like a lot, but it is €1.5 billion. The rest is coming from the existing social protection budget in the form of RAS and leasing. In other words, people will stay exactly where they are in precarious circumstances. Meanwhile, landlords are evicting people daily because they can get higher rents in the private market. It is bogus and a fantasy to say that there is this big extra injection of money.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	A question please.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	In these announcements, the Minister promised a national average 25% reduction in the housing list but it is not even being met in Dublin. The allocation is lower in Dublin where the housing crisis is at its worst. How can the Minister explain this?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	More than €500 million will go to Dublin between now and the end of 2017. The Deputy can challenge the figures all he wants, but that is real money. I have some news for the Deputy concerning the targets he has so eloquently addressed. As regards the targets set for the four local authorities in Dublin, we asked them all what they wanted. We met with them and discussed it in detail. The Dublin social housing strategy is separate to everything else we do because of the issues in the capital. When we received their wish lists, I set higher targets for them than they had sought. That is how much we are putting into Dublin. Some €500 million is going into Dublin until the end of 2017. As regards the Deputy's comments on homelessness, we have put together a huge package to help homeless people. Unfortunately, it would be impossible to have a utopian package that addresses everything immediately. However, if the Deputy asks Alice Leahy of Trust and many others whether they have seen a dramatic impact as a result of it, they will certainly tell him that they have.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	In recent months, the grim facts of a dramatic increase in families, including children, being driven into homelessness speak for themselves. I will give an example concerning targets in my own area. In a letter sent to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Minister mentions a target of 681 new houses. When one breaks it down, however, there are only 300 new houses, or less. The rest are leases, RAS or HAPs, which are not new council houses. Much of it is not new money either. The housing waiting list in Dún Laoghaire is growing by 100 per month. The Minister is going to give us 300 new houses over three years, when 1,200 people are joining the list in a year. That means the list will be a million miles longer in a few years if this is all the new social housing construction the Minister can provide. It is not even a drop in the ocean. We will not even be standing still and the crisis will get worse. 
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	I have secured the largest budget for social housing in the history of the State. The Deputy referred to Dún Laoghaire. We have had a substantial engagement with the local council there. However, he omits the fact that there is a mix, including purchasing units in some cases. The Deputy has often spoken about boarded-up social houses, which we call voids. They are being turned around more quickly. We have a mix in each local authority based on their analysis of how many units can be turned around quickly through that combination, be it by building, purchasing, leasing or voids. This is real money and I resent the fact that the Deputy thinks it is not so.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	Is it existing money?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	This is real money that is fixed and ring-fenced for this purpose. It will have a dramatic impact. I want to see it being turned around as quickly as possible. We have weekly meetings with the Dublin housing taskforce and I also chair a monthly meeting with all the relevant parties to ensure that this situation is being turned around as quickly as possible. The Deputy should remember that we inherited a situation where houses were not being built for decades. Ultimately, it takes time to turn that around. 
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I wish to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, when the social inclusion and community activation programme will be fully operational. What impact will the legal challenge to the way that programme was rolled out have on the progress of the programme? Can the Minister of State also say when she expects the full set of Leader companies to be chosen and operational? When does she expect them to be in a position to roll out the first grants under the new Leader programme?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	The Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2014–2020 will provide €250 million in financial resources to support the development of sustainable rural communities. As the Deputy will be aware, under the EU regulatory framework governing the Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020, each EU member state must conduct an open and transparent process to select both the local development strategies and local action groups for each sub-regional area. Accordingly, my Department is conducting a two-stage process. The first stage, which is an expressions of interest, EOI, stage, was recently launched. Any entity wishing to be considered as a local action group for their area has until 15 May 2015 to submit an EOI. Local action groups and local development strategies will be selected by an independent selection committee established specifically for that purpose. Entities that are successful in the first stage of the process will be invited and supported in stage two of the process, which involves the design of a local development strategy for their area. I expect that some local development strategies will be operational and that funding will be available for them by autumn 2015.  My Department’s local and community development programme, LCDP, concluded on 31 March 2015 and the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, was rolled out across communities on 1 April 2015.  SICAP was subject to a public procurement process. Tenderers have now been informed of the outcome of their tender. Local and community development committees, LCDCs, have finalised contracts with the winning tenderers in all but two areas of the country, where interim arrangements to support business continuity have been put in place. I can confirm that funding has been forwarded to SICAP implementing bodies and actions under the programme have now commenced.  The primary focus of the Department is to ensure that front-line services, particularly those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities, are protected. I am confident the new programme will continue to provide key supports to those most in need in our communities. In order to support entities making expressions of interest, my Department has been organising information sessions. Such sessions were held in Nenagh, Tullamore and Sligo last night.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I understand a judicial review has been sought in respect of the decision relating to the roll-out of the social inclusion and community activation programme in County Galway. Will the Minister of State clarify whether she will continue to provide interim funding to the existing companies for the duration of this judicial process? Are discussions taking place between her Department and the companies to try to resolve the issues at stake without having to go to the great expense, on both sides, of a court case?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	It has not been possible to finalise SICAP contractual arrangements in Counties Galway and Meath at this time. Legal issues have arisen in both cases and continue to be followed up. We are very committed to resolving these issues. However, there is a legal process under way, tenders were sought and won, and I am restricted in what I can say at this time.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I understand that in a case such as this, discussions sometimes take place outside the legal process to resolve the issues at stake. In fact, cases are often sorted out on the steps of the court, even after enormous expenses have been incurred. In such cases, resolution is achieved by way of negotiation rather than through the legal process, the latter involving great expense for both sides. Is the Minister of State willing to enter into discussions with a party which has serious concerns, namely, FORUM Connemara, in an effort to resolve the issues, rather than bringing everybody through a very expensive court case which may or may not go in the Department's favour? This matter is urgent given that leave for judicial review to ascertain whether there is a substantive case has already been granted.
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	I assure the Deputy that my officials and I are doing everything we can to resolve these matters. I am precluded from interfering in the legal process in any way, but we are doing all we can outside that process. Nobody is ignoring the issue; it is receiving the fullest attention within the Department.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	Notwithstanding the bogus propaganda that €3.8 billion has been allocated for the provision of 110,000 social housing units, the reality is that €2.3 billion of that relates to the existing rent allowance budget of the Department of Social Protection. That is a fact, as verified by the Department in the reply to a parliamentary question I submitted earlier this week. Two thirds of the houses the Minister is promising come under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, that is, they are properties rented out by private landlords. When landlords are increasing rents and evicting people on a daily basis, how can the Minister seriously expect us to believe the HAP scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, that he is promising will deliver the housing that is desperately needed by people such as those in the Gallery today?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I thank the Deputy for his question. As outlined by the Minister, the implementation of the HAP scheme is a key Government priority under the Social Housing Strategy 2020, which sets out a range of ambitious targets. The scheme is vital if we are to meet housing demand, which, as the Deputy rightly points out, is increasing. The funding that has been committed under the social housing strategy is evidence of our commitment in this area. More than €3 billion has been ring-fenced for the provision of a mixture of housing solutions. All Deputies will know from their constituency clinics that local authorities have not been building houses for the past 12 years. We came into government at a time when houses were simply not available in local authority areas and voids were not being turned around quickly enough. The Minister and I have given a major focus to improving the turnaround of voids. For the first time, we are measuring how long these turnarounds are taking and how much they are costing. That will help to reduce the housing lists, but it will take time. The construction of new homes, likewise, will take time, because it involves the issuing of tenders and so on before construction can commence. Huge investment is going into that area. In the meantime, we must put in place other solutions, one of which is the HAP scheme. I would expect the Deputy to welcome the funding we are putting in place to bring benefits to tenants in terms of security of tenure, improved accommodation standards and so on. Every local authority that administers a HAP scheme must ensure properties are inspected and brought up to standard within eight months. Something had to be done to bridge the gap in accommodation provision until the new house-building programmes commence. The HAP scheme is working very well in that regard in seven local authority areas and is about to be rolled out in 12 more areas around the country. I am confident that this component of the social housing strategy will help to address the demand to which the Deputy referred.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	Hundreds of families are being evicted on a monthly basis by landlords who are running away from rent allowance arrangements with local authorities. At any point in time across the Dublin local authority areas, dozens of RAS landlords are evicting tenants. How can the Minister of State expect us to accept that all these people will be brought into the HAP scheme? That is not going to happen. Will he at least admit that of the €3.8 billion allocated, €2.3 billion is for the existing rent allowance budget of the Department of Social Protection? The new funding being provided is actually €1.5 billion, and that is simply not enough. Indeed, it goes nowhere near dealing with the problem in the short or long term. What is required is new houses. In the meantime, however, I can offer the Minister of State a solution to meet existing need. The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has €4 billion in cash. That is our money. Putting even half of it into an emergency programme of social housing construction, to commence immediately, and using whatever empty properties the agency has to provide emergency accommodation would go a good away towards addressing the need that is out there.

The Government is committed to prioritising and resolving this issue. The Deputy, however, seems to be conveniently pointing to the worst-case scenarios. The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, is doing a great of good work in terms of raising awareness of tenants' rights. In fact, a campaign is under way, in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection, at the moment. I advise the Deputy and any citizen who has concerns in this area to visit the website keepingyourhome.ie, operated by the Money Advice & Budgeting Service and the Citizens Information Board, which sets out the legislation that is in place to protect people from eviction in cases in which rents have been hiked. That is not allowed to happen under existing law, and there is support and advice available for people in that scenario. The Deputy is not giving local authorities the credit due to them for bringing thousands of people into successful rental accommodation schemes around the country. A report on the implementation of the HAP scheme has been submitted to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and it is open to the Deputy or any Member to scrutinise that report to see what progress that has been made. Some 1,500 people are now successfully participating in the scheme in the seven pilot local authority areas. We intend to increase the participation rate to more than 8,000 by the end of this year when the next wave is rolled out in 12 local authority areas. Progress is being made and we would welcome the Deputy's support for it. There can be no permanent solution until the new houses are built. I ask the Deputy to acknowledge that on the floor of the Dáil this morning.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	I work every day with a local authority that is firefighting in the face of this disastrous situation. The worst-case scenario is being experienced by the people in the Gallery, who represent only the tip of the iceberg that is the disaster unfolding in Dublin and other urban centres. I want to work with the Minister of State to find solutions, but we must be honest here. The numbers he gave in reference to the sign-up rate for the HAP scheme relate to existing rent allowance landlords. Nothing has changed for the people on housing lists, who will not get a council house as a result of these changes. A few landlords will sign up to HAP, but many of them are walking away.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	Would you put your question please, Deputy?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	How can the Minister seriously base the future housing strategy on the disastrous crisis we are facing in the hope that he will get tens of thousands of private landlords to sign up for these schemes when they are walking away from rent allowance or arrangements with local authorities?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	I want to clarify one item for the Deputy. He said the €4 billion includes the housing assistance payment, HAP. There is €4 billion of capital committed to the year 2020. The Deputy said nothing has changed. A great deal has changed in the past year. The Construction 2020 strategy will address many of the deficits in terms of housing provision throughout the country. We are only now seeing the construction sector getting back to some level of normality in terms of construction. We were building 90,000 houses a year, which was unsustainable. We need to get that back to some level of sustainability. In addition, in the coming weeks the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, and I will announce hundreds of schemes throughout the country for direct build, the very schemes for which the Deputy is calling, but they cannot be built today or tomorrow. In the meantime, we have to bridge that gap through schemes such as the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the HAP because the houses cannot be "magicked" out of the air. That is what the Deputy is calling for but that cannot be delivered overnight so we have to provide for the very people he is talking about, and we will provide for them through the provision of RAS and HAP. This will bring benefits in terms of certainty in rental standards administered by the local authority at the same differential rental rate as the local authority. These supports are in place. The Private Residential Tenancies Board is supporting people in private accommodation under threat of eviction. Also, the Department of Social Protection will engage with them on a case by case basis to assist them. I want to be clear that there is support for people under threat of eviction and we in the Government and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will support them also.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	As the Deputy is well aware, I announced delivery targets under the social housing strategy for all local authorities which took into account proposals submitted by the local authorities themselves for the delivery of units for the period 2015 to 2017. It is important to stress that every local authority, including the Deputy's local authority, had to put forward their own proposals. They were best positioned to evaluate what was necessary in Kildare, or in Dublin or elsewhere, so they put forward their own submissions. These new proposals are being assessed by my Department and I expect, as the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, said, to make announcements very soon on projects to be advanced across the country and to be doing that continually for the rest of my time in this Department as projects are rolled out. I am fully committed to ensuring that this is done in the speediest fashion possible. The scale of ambition represented in these targets and the accompanying funding allocations illustrate that housing is the highest priority for Government. Over €1.5 billion is to be invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes which will, when completed, accommodate an average of 25% of those on local authority waiting lists. That varies depending on the scale of the lists across the local authorities. Details of all social housing units acquired or developed by local authorities to date, including Kildare, are published on my Department’s website, as are quarterly and monthly reports on homelessness which are provided by housing authorities through the pathway accommodation and support system. Information on housing applications is captured in the statutory assessment of housing need, which was last carried out in 2013 and which indicated almost 90,000 households on local authority housing lists nationally. Under the reforms proposed in the social housing strategy, and I believe every Deputy will welcome this, it is my intention that housing needs assessments will be carried out on an annual basis because we need this information much quicker and rather than doing it on a biannual basis or every two or three years, we will be doing that every single year.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I thank the Minister for the comprehensive reply. Given that there are almost 7,000 families on the waiting list in County Kildare, does he believe that the indications, based on the information to date, are that it will be possible to meet the most urgent cases, namely, those who are homeless and those likely to become homeless in the near future, within a reasonable time?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	The answer to that question is "Yes". We have worked with every local authority, including the local authority in the Deputy's constituency, to ensure that what they have requested is being prioritised. We are working with the local authorities on that and are being as flexible as we can to help sign off on projects that can be turned around as quickly as possible, whether that be new builds or where there is an excess of voids. It is clear to us that every local authority has unique circumstances be it an excess of voids as is the case in some local authorities or where, in fairness, local authorities have aggregated land for new builds, done the planning etc. Regarding the local authority in the Deputy's constituency with which I am quite familiar, the priorities indicated by him and other Deputies from the area will be met, particularly in terms of those in a vulnerable situation. There are particular challenges in regard to Kildare, given that it is in the conurbation around Dublin. I am satisfied that in the past year in particular the Kildare local authority has ramped up in terms of everything it needs to do from a resource, planning and delivery point of view to hit the targets we set it, particularly with regard to vulnerable people because like other local authorities around Dublin, it has specific issues.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I agree with the current approach given that for many years nothing was happening in the housing area. Will it be possible to monitor on a monthly basis the extent to which progress is being made in those counties most severely affected by a shortage of housing and an excessive number of people on the local authority housing lists? To what extent can he do that and reassure people on those waiting lists that help is approaching?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	I am happy the Deputy asked that question because I want to outline to the House the level of management the Department is putting into this as it is such an important issue. All the local authority housing managers and directors are currently meeting with my Department. That is the level of seriousness with which we are taking this issue. Yesterday, myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, chaired the social housing oversight group which meets every month to ensure that everything is happening in that regard. Also, a meeting is taking place this week with the approved housing bodies. We have targets, and measures to judge those targets. They are checked on a weekly and monthly basis. We have zoned in on pressure areas in particular. We have heat mapped the country. We have identified the absolute priorities in regard to housing and we will concentrate on those in particular. For instance, as regards housing in Dublin, a meeting takes place at 9 o'clock every Monday morning involving the Dublin task force and Dublin City Council. That is the priority our Department is giving this issue.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	On Question No. 7, the Deputy is not present so it will be replied to with Written Answers.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	This is a straightforward question to the Minister about ending homelessness. The programme for Government states that 2016 will be the year that will be attained. Is that realistic now considering the crisis in the housing market?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I thank the Deputy for his question. The long-term solution to homelessness is to increase the supply of homes, particularly in terms of social housing. In November 2014, I launched the Government’s Social Housing Strategy: 2020. This is a six-year strategy which is intended to deliver over 110,000 social housing tenancies through the provision of 35,000 new social housing units, at a cost of €3.8 billion, and we have been able to increase that amount, and by meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation schemes. I am committed to addressing the issue of homelessness. As the Deputy will be aware, I hosted a special summit last December, involving all the relevant bodies, groups and organisations, which resulted in a comprehensive action plan. A range of measures are being taken to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households and mobilise the necessary supports in order to deliver on the Government's target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016. All of the measures are set out in the Government's implementation plan on the State's response to homelessness of May 2014 and in the action plan to address homelessness of December 2014. Progress in implementing these plans is reported to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform, which meets regularly. It is an absolute top priority of that committee. The plans and progress reports are also available on my Department's website.  On a personal basis, the issue of homelessness is an absolute priority for me, the Minister of State, Deputy Coffey, and our Department. We will continue to examine whatever measures are necessary to help and facilitate local authorities and other agencies deal with this important and human issue. However, we need co-operation from many different quarters in order to do that.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I thank the Minister for his response. This issue was raised recently during Leaders' Questions by Deputy Ó Cuív. The Simon Community has said that in its history the crisis has never been as bad, particularly in Dublin. In the programme for Government, there is a commitment to ending long-term homelessness for families and the need to sleep rough. The tragic case of poor Jonathan Corrie last December, which happened just outside the Dáil, was shocking. That sparked an impetus and a focus to deal with this issue. However, until the Government directly deals with the supply issue and brings more social housing on line, it will have extreme difficulty in dealing with the issue. Is there an initiative to stop soaring rents which are resulting in an increase in the number of people facing homelessness? For instance, is the Minister considering providing tax relief to landlords so that they accept people in receipt of rent supplement?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I respect the sincerity in which the Deputy asks this question. I have always said, and I wish to be fair to Deputies across the Chamber who have worked with me on it, that this issue is above political to-ing and fro-ing. Many measures are being taken and examined. We are constantly examining other ways in which we can facilitate. We listed 80 actions and implemented them before Christmas and this had a huge impact. We said we would create more emergency accommodation and we did so, in fact we created more, and it has been taken up. We have a protocol with the Department of Social Protection on rent supplement and many tenancies have been maintained as a result of interventions by Threshold. The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, is currently tendering for a tenants' rights promotion programme. The housing assistance payment, HAP, is being rolled out for homeless people in Dublin. We have worked with NAMA. 
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I thank the Minister.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I thank the Minister.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	However, I need local authorities, in particular, to play ball on this.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	The Minister is way over time. I call Deputy Terence Flanagan.

That is a major issue and a crisis that needs to be tackled. Does the Minister see himself achieving the target of ending long-term homelessness by 2016? There are issues relating to people who will not accept help. When do the authorities step in? In my constituency, there is a young man who has mental health issues. He is not accepting help from the authorities, such as the HSE and psychiatry professionals. He is gradually deteriorating and it is heartbreaking to see it. What changes can be made in that area? Will the Minister look at this issue?
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	It is our ambition to meet our targets in respect of ending involuntary long-term homelessness. I will deal with two issues in the short time available to me. First, to conclude my earlier point, I need the co-operation of local authorities. In some cases, that has not been forthcoming. Given its role in the refurbishment of certain apartments in O'Devaney Gardens, Dublin City Council has been tasked with finding immediate replacements, which it must have by next week. This is absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, in this country we are still suffering a little from NIMBY-ism in respect of this issue. I was very surprised with the decision. Having said that, I respect the decision of the elected representatives.  I do not have much time remaining but Deputy Terence Flanagan is correct on the second point. We have met all the different social agencies in respect of helping people who will not accept help. It is quite a difficult thing. Professional people are involved, but intervention mechanisms have to be judged. Sometimes people will not accept help and that is why we established the night bus service and the night café. Some people will not take emergency accommodation. That is true. We have to respect people's civil and human rights, but there is a pendulum. When the HSE and other agencies should intervene is something I leave to the professionals. I listen to people like Alice Leahy of TRUST, who I consider to be an authority on these issues. In some cases, it is a very delicate operation, but they do their best. Do they get everything right? It is almost an impossible situation, but they do their best.

The money was transferred from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. Somewhere in the transfer, €97,000, which is a drop in the ocean in State funding, has been cut from the island funding. Can the Minister explain how much money he transferred and whether he had a prior arrangement with the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht that it would make up any shortfall in the funding transferred?
#AnnPhelan	unknown-#AnnPhelan-party	unknown-#AnnPhelan-dob	unknown-#AnnPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I assure Deputy Ó Cuív that the islands outside the Gaeltacht islands are of huge importance to me. My Department’s local and community development programme, LCDP, concluded on 31 March 2015 and the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, was rolled out across communities on 1 April 2015. During 2014, €527,000 was provided to Comhar na nOileán, the local development company for the islands, for the delivery of the LCDP to offshore islands. As the Deputy will be aware, SICAP was subject to a public procurement process and Comhar na nOileán did not win funding under the SICAP procurement process similar to the funding it received under the LCDP.  We recognise the status of island communities and a revised scheme to support the non-Gaeltacht islands has been agreed between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. For the avoidance of doubt, this is a new scheme and does not involve the transfer of responsibility of any function from my Department. I am advised that the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will now commence an engagement process with island communities in respect of this new scheme.Funding of €516,463 is being provided to island communities for community development purposes in 2015. This includes €460,481 directly to Comhar na nOileán, €268,958 of which will be disbursed by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under a new scheme, and €55,982 directly to islands under SICAP in respect of the Mayo and Cork islands. This amount does not take account of funding to other inhabited islands under the Galway county SICAP lot, the north Kerry SICAP lot and the Donegal Gaeltacht SICAP lot. Any additional funding for the new islands scheme will be a matter for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to address as the lead Department for islands. To help inform himself about the situation, the Deputy could put a parliamentary question to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh.

Last year, the community development companies received €527,000. I refer to the companies, not SICAP or LCDP. Some €131,000 was given during the first three months of the year. Instead of transferring €397,000, the Minister's Department transferred €300,000 and nicked €97,000. Was a transfer of €300,000 made to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to facilitate the start of the new scheme? Why was it not €397,000 so the same money could be given to the island development companies this year as last year? In 2013, the Government cut those companies' funding by 9.7%.

Perhaps the Deputy will want to return to the Government's policy of alignment whereby the islands are being looked after by the local authority. I direct the Deputy's attention again to the fact that the Government is providing over €460,000 directly to Comhar na nOileán, over €260,000 of which will be disbursed by the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I implore the Deputy to put a question to the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh. More than €55,000 is being provided directly to the islands under SICAP in respect of the Mayo and Cork islands, not including Galway county SICAP, north Kerry SICAP and Donegal Gaeltacht SICAP. I do not understand how the Deputy can suggest that we are not concerned about the islands.

Last year, they had €527,000 to run the companies. This year, it has been cut by €97,000 somewhere between the Minister of State transferring money from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I have checked this out, and it has been verified by both Departments. There has been a 24% cut in the amount of money to run the companies on Clare Island, Inishturk and Inishbofin and to the five islands in County Cork that receive the services from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. The Minister of State expects them to run the same service for 24% less, having been affected by a cut of 9.5% in 2013. It is unfair and unsustainable, and if the Ministers care about the islands, they will put back the €100,000 between them.

In order to achieve efficiencies, there was a co-ordinated approach to local development in the context of county, regional and national planning, and this is the road along which we are proceeding. The islands will also be looked after in this context. The Deputy does not have the monopoly on concern for the islands. I am also concerned, as are my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.

Over the years, many suggestions have been made for change to the format and layout of ballot papers. These include blacking or shading the empty emblem box for non–party candidates and the use of the word "independent" instead of "non-party". The Convention on the Constitution, in its fourth report, recommended changing the alphabetic order of candidates. We have been down this road before. The proposed electoral commission will be asked to give further consideration to the proposal, as the Deputy may be aware. I have published a consultation paper on the establishment of an electoral commission and it is currently the subject of a process of consultation, under the aegis of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, which I expect to report to me. Everybody in the House has an opinion on this matter. I am not sure if there is an absolute right or wrong. I have no plans to alter the layout of the ballot paper in advance of the by-election. The Deputy has expressed his views on this before, and if we receive some initial thoughts on it, we may consider something before the forthcoming general election. However, I am loth to change the ballot paper unless I see some real, qualified justification for doing so. To date, we have heard various different opinions. It is through the commission that we will get the solution to this issue, if changes are necessary at all.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I thank the Minister for his response and I welcome the fact that the commission is to be established shortly. People read from left to right, and the Minister mentioned the idea of blanking out the space or putting some sort of independent logo on the ballot paper. In the left hand column of the ballot paper, the party logos are displayed beside the party candidates, while the space beside the independent candidates is blank and I have observed over many elections that people vote in the column on the left. They start off by giving their No. 1 vote to an independent candidate and then keep going in that column. Thus, candidates who are affiliated to a party are at a disadvantage. It would be very simple to rectify this in the by-election and from then on. I have seen hundreds of ballot papers marked in this way. Party members are immediately disadvantaged, given that people read from left to right. It is a very simple matter. I was amazed, and I raised it after the local elections when I first noticed it. Hundreds of ballot papers were marked in that way. I would be interested in the Minister's response.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	The Deputy has raised a number of issues and this is one. I will examine it. The Deputy and others, who take a keen interest in this, as we all should, have raised several issues.It is a valid argument and it is something we will be able to deal with over time. I must take some advice on it, particularly legal advice, but at this juncture it is something I would consider favourably.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	I am delighted to hear that the Minister will do that. I take it that the ballot papers for the by-election have not been printed yet, so there might be time to act beforehand and deal with this anomaly. In our system of the single transferable vote a small difference such as that can make a massive difference to the result. The eighth, ninth and tenth preference can affect the outcome of an election. I have seen hundreds of these papers marked in that way. I have raised this previously and I am very frustrated that it has not yet been rectified. However, I am pleased that the Minister has decided to examine this. It should be done before the by-election, as the papers are not printed yet. The Minister could get it done by issuing an instruction that an X, a black mark or something be put there. Members of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or any other party with a logo are at a disadvantage because of this. It is a small issue, but it can have a big outcome.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	The Deputy makes a valid point and we will certainly examine it. I cannot commit to getting it done before the by-election, although I will see if it is possible. We will take advice on the matter and revert to the Deputy and the House. However, the issue is validly put and must be seriously examined.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	As the Minister saw this morning - obviously, it is not the first time it has been highlighted - housing provision is a major issue. In fact, it is a crisis. I spoke to somebody from the Simon Community about the situation in Dublin. He said that when he was speaking to housing officials in Dublin City Council he saw the whites of their eyes and the solid fear in coming to terms with how they might deal with this issue into the future. It is about empowering local authorities and also the private sector to ensure there is housing provision. I am conscious of the correspondence between the Minister's Department and the Department of Finance-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	The Deputy must conclude.

I have received correspondence from the Secretary General in the Minister's Department-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	You can put a further question shortly.

#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	Planning is one of my areas of responsibility. The Deputy referred to the word "spinning". It has been clarified to the Deputy by the Secretary General of the Department that it was an inappropriate and ill-advised comment between officials in the Department of Finance and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. The Deputy's question is very relevant and topical. As has been said already this morning, it is critical to address the housing supply issues in Dublin in particular and also throughout the country. The construction sector is recovering from the worst blow it has ever experienced. Construction is only contributing approximately 6% of GNP when it should be contributing 12%. We are working towards a normalised construction sector to increase the supply of housing through the Construction 2020 and social housing strategies. A sum of €4 billion is committed to the social housing strategy up to 2020. The Government is also working on initiatives to increase the supply of houses in the private sector. I intend to bring a planning Bill before the House shortly that will help to stimulate and incentivise further housing contributions from the private sector. The Deputy asks about the measures taken and the figures published by the Department. As part of the Construction 2020 strategy the Department established the Dublin housing supply and co-ordination task force, which includes the CEOs of the four local authorities, with the support of the Housing Agency. One of the first actions of the task force was to analyse the stock of planning permissions and zoned land for housing developments in Dublin. Its first report was published in June 2014. Across the four Dublin local authorities, planning permissions are in place for the immediate development of approximately 21,000 housing units. The permissions are unconstrained. An additional 25,500 new homes are considered permissible in the immediate to short term on lands zoned and available for development but which do not currently have the benefit of planning permission. These published figures were presented by the Dublin task force and are supported by the Housing Agency.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	The Minister referred to the correspondence I received from the Secretary General and the clarification that was given. It is appropriate that I put an excerpt from that on the public record. The Secretary General stated that in the context of the engagement taking place on this issue, the intent of the Department official's comments would have been understood by the recipients of the e-mail, but that the use of the word "spinning" rather than language such as "highlighting" or "indicating" when referring to public statements regarding the sufficiency in the medium term of land zoned in Dublin was both inappropriate and ill advised, and clearly open to different interpretations. He apologised for that on behalf of the Department. I accept that apology. I again ask the Minister to respond to the House and to those on housing waiting lists, those who have no opportunity to purchase a home and those who have no access to the mortgage interest rates that should be available to them just as they are to their European counterparts. Have we learned nothing from what happened previously with respect to the housing bubble that is growing daily and a crisis that is evolving into a calamity? Can the Minister confirm that the figures being provided by the Department regarding the amount of zoned lands available to be built on this year are proper and correct?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	The reference from the e-mail mentioned by the Deputy has been acknowledged by the Secretary General, and he has apologised and stated that it was inappropriate. However, I again refer the Deputy to the facts presented by the Dublin housing supply and co-ordination task force and supported by the Housing Agency. We are emerging from a legacy of a devastated economy and construction sector, with house building having been essentially wiped out in this country for a number of years. Now we must get it back to sustainable levels through the Construction 2020 strategy, supported by analysis and research from the Housing Agency, by the Dublin task force and by proper planning regulation, which will be further enhanced by the forthcoming planning Bill. We are working towards having a sustainable sector, not one that will go through boom and bust, as was the case in the past, but one that will contribute to our economy in a sustainable manner, supply houses where they are most needed and build the right types of house in the right places. The data on the Dublin housing supply that has been published is the most recent and up-to-date information available.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	I thank the Minister for that further clarification. I await with interest the incentives, initiatives and means by which he will seek to encourage more house building in the near future. I will make a number of suggestions in that regard over next weekend and I hope he will listen to and take cognisance of them. They will be the result of much research and reflection on what happened in the past, and we should learn from that with a view to dealing with the immediacy of the current situation. I again impress on the Minister and his colleagues that the only way we can address this crisis is by lifting the rent cap to deal with the immediate problem of those who find themselves in a precarious situation in respect of their lease. Others are in a precarious situation by virtue of the fact that two years ago the Government allowed banks to have a veto on solutions to mortgage arrears issues.

I hope he and his party will reflect on the damage that has been done to this economy due to the policies that were implemented over the last ten or 20 years in housing and construction. I am open to listening to any positive proposals the Deputy might make. I think they will have a further opportunity to engage with these issues in the context of forthcoming planning Bills. I will certainly have an open mind if they can come forward with positive and sustainable housing proposals.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." It is a pleasure to bring the Statute Law Revision Bill 2015 before the House this morning. As Deputies will be aware, the main effect of the Bill is to revoke all Government orders or other secondary instruments made prior to 1821, apart from a specific list of 40 instruments that are being preserved. The Bill expressly revokes 5,782 secondary instruments and implicitly repeals thousands of others. This makes it the largest ever repealing measure, by express repeals, in this jurisdiction or any other. The Bill is part of a broader series of measures which have been enacted since the establishment of the statute law revision programme 13 years ago. Further measures are planned by the Government to complete the review of this country's Statute Book. As Members will recall, a number of previous statute law revision Bills have dealt with primary legislation, primarily Acts of Parliament from before Independence. This Bill now moves the process on to deal with secondary instruments such as proclamations and orders. The revocation proposals set out in the Bill were developed following a detailed research and consultation process. As part of an overall programme of statute law revision, the Bill will help to simplify and modernise our law and make it more intelligible. It will save time and costs for lawyers and others who need to know what the law actually is. To put it simply, it will make it easier for citizens to access justice. When the Bill is enacted, it will facilitate the process of regulatory reform; ensure the Statute Book is significantly more modern; enhance public accessibility to the Statute Book; facilitate future legislative measures to repeal, re-enact - with amendments, where necessary - and consolidate the statute law of the State; and enable, for the first time since the foundation of the State, the identification of a complete list of all legislation that remains in force here. I think it is a very sensible measure. The details of the instruments revoked by this Bill give a fascinating historical insight into the regulatory environment of the period in question. The subject matter of the instruments varies from pardons for information received in relation to specific crimes to the imposition of quarantine requirements to prevent the spread of plague and orders for the summoning of the first Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. One of the earliest references in the Bill is to an order concerning the publication of the Magna Carta in 1215, which is a long time before the Acting Chairman was around.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	As many Deputies will know, the Magna Carta is celebrating its 800th anniversary this year. It is of note that aspects of it and of the Irish Magna Carta of 1216 continue in force in Ireland today. In addition to revoking secondary instruments, the Bill amends the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 by removing the exemption of certain statutory instruments or classes of statutory instruments from publication. This will lead to greater transparency in our Statute Book. Statute law revision concerns the removal of legislation from the Statute Book which is no longer relevant or the purpose of which is exhausted. The purpose of such revision is to enhance public accessibility to the Statute Book and pave the way for further modernisation measures. There is a particular need for such revision in Ireland because our unique legislative past has left us with a complex stock of legislation, with enactments from Parliaments of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom. Ireland’s pre-Independence statute law consists of primary legislation - public, local and personal, and private Acts of Parliament - and secondary legislation, such as Government proclamations and orders. Best practice in regulatory governance requires states to review their stock of legislation on a regular basis and to repeal and revoke legislation which is spent, unused, unnecessary or otherwise appropriate for removal from their statute books. This Bill continues the important work of the statute law reform programme. This work is part of the 2011-16 programme for Government and is a specific element of the 2014-16 public service reform plan. The current programme of statute law revision was established in 2003 and has resulted in the Statute Law Revision Acts of 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2012. Collectively, these Acts have expressly or implicitly repealed approximately 95% of pre-Independence primary legislation. In 2012, the statute law revision programme transferred from the Office of the Attorney General to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Statute Law Revision Act 2012 was enacted following the transfer of the programme to that Department. This completed the review of pre-Independence primary legislation. In July 2013, the Government approved a second phase of statute law revision, including the drafting of this legislation to revoke secondary instruments. As the approval of the heads of this Bill predated the introduction of Order 123A, the general scheme of the Bill was not forwarded for pre-legislative scrutiny. However, a draft list of instruments and details of the Bill was published. The preparation of this Bill began in September 2013 with the chronological identification and assessment of numerous secondary instruments, such as orders, proclamations and similar instruments. There is no single source, or even index, of pre-Independence secondary instruments applicable to Ireland. As a result, a full review of items contained in The Dublin Gazette, The London Gazette and certain other printed collections was carried out by the statute law revision programme. Secondary instruments identified following this review were examined to ascertain whether they were applicable to Ireland and suitable for revocation. Forty instruments that were applicable to Ireland but are not suitable for repeal are listed in Schedule 1 for retention. A total of 5,782 instruments were identified as suitable for revocation and have been listed in Schedule 2. As with previous statute law revision legislation, the format of this Bill involves revoking all instruments coming within its ambit, except those listed in Schedule 1. However, Schedule 2 provides for information purposes a list of revoked instruments. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform engaged in a consultation exercise with other affected Departments in preparation for the introduction of this Bill. A draft list of instruments and details of the Bill was published on the website of the Department in September of last year. In addition, relevant bodies and organisations that could potentially be affected by proposed repeals continue to be made aware of the ongoing work of the statute law revision programme. I wish to outline the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 is the interpretation section. I want to refer to one definition in particular. The word "instrument", which is a key term in the Bill, is defined to cover three categories of instrument. The first category covers any instrument that describes itself as "an order, regulation, rule, bye-law, scheme, or proclamation" if it was made under statutory, charter or executive or administrative authority or if it was published in The Dublin Gazette or The London Gazette. The second category covers similar instruments irrespective of their descriptions but which are "of a regulatory, general or public nature" if such instruments were made under statutory, charter or executive or administrative authority or were published in The Dublin Gazette or The London Gazette. This category will capture instruments that are akin to orders, regulations and rules but do not describe themselves as such. The definition specifically excludes charters and letters patent, because they will be the subject of a separate Bill in accordance with the Government decision of July 2013 to which I referred earlier. The third category covers instruments referred to in Schedule 2, which lists instruments that will be revoked by this Bill. Section 2(1) is the central feature of this Bill. It provides for a fundamental clarification and simplification of the Statute Book by drawing a line at 1 January 1821 and revoking all instruments passed prior to that point except, as I have outlined, for instruments listed in Schedule 1.Schedule 1 contains the instruments which it is considered necessary to retain. Section 2(2)(a) saves the instruments in Schedule 1. Section 2(2)(b) saves, for the avoidance of doubt, any transitional or continuing provision that applies to any instrument that has already been revoked prior to the present Bill. Section 2(4) provides a clear new power to revoke the instruments in Schedule 1, as in some cases the original power to revoke has ceased to apply, such as where the order was made under the prerogative, or has become unworkable. Section 3(1) provides that for information purposes, Schedule 2 will list the instruments identified by the statute law revision programme as coming within the scope of the revocation by section 2. These are the specific instruments which were identified as being obsolete, unnecessary or as having ceased to be in force. Section 3(2) provides that an instrument being omitted from Schedule 2 does not imply that the instrument is saved. Section 3(3) provides that the inclusion of an instrument in Schedule 2 does not deem it to have been of full force and effect immediately prior to the Act. Section 4 assigns citations to any instrument that is listed in Schedule 1. The section is based on section 4 of the Statute Law Revision Acts 2007 and 2009. However, unlike those Acts, there is no reference to existing citations as none of the instruments already had citations. Section 5 provides for a standard savings clause and is based on section 9(1) of the Statute Law Revision Act 2007 and section 6(1) of both the subsequent Acts. Section 6 amends the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 to remove the ability to exempt statutory instruments from publication. Section 6(a)(i) inserts a new subsection 2A into the Act of 1947, to exempt instruments made under certain sections of the Defence Act 1954 and the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 from the operation of the general application of the Act of 1947. Instruments made under those sections will not be affected by the amendments to the 1947 Act. Section 6(a)(ii) repeals sections 3 and 4 of the Act of 1947 and section 6(a)(iii) removes references to directions from section 2 of the Act of 1947, which is a consequential amendment. This will have the effect of removing the power, which has existed for nearly 70 years, to exempt instruments from normal publication. I hope the House will agree that this provision is a further important step towards transparency in our Statute Book. Paragraph (b) of section 6 will delete the obligation of the stationery office to send hard copies of all instruments to the chambers of commerce. As all statutory instruments are now available online, the need to send out hard copies has significantly lessened and the removal of this provision will achieve savings and greater efficiency. Section 7 provides for evidence of instruments and is based on section 8 of the 2007 Act. There are, however, a greater number of sources for the pre-1820 instruments. It also includes a number of abbreviations used in the Schedules. Section 8 provides for the powers in relation to evidence of early Acts to transfer from the Taoiseach to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This reflects the transfer of the programme to the Department in 2012, to which I alluded earlier. Section 9 provides for a Short Title and collective citations, including a collective citation for the 36 previous Statute Law Revision Acts. Schedule 1 lists the instruments to be retained. Each part of Schedule 1 lists the instruments which it is considered are not appropriate for revocation at this stage and are being retained in force specifically. The format of the Schedule is based on the Schedules to the Statute Law Revision Acts 2007, 2009 and 2012 with the addition of a new column 1 with a reference number and a new column 4 to identify the Minister conferred with a revocation power in respect of that instrument pursuant to section 2(5). Schedule 2 lists the specific instruments identified in the course of the review as appropriate for revocation at this stage because they have ceased to be relevant or have become unnecessary. They will be instruments which, while applicable to Ireland, have been identified in the course of the review as appropriate for revocation because they are spent, obsolete or have otherwise become unnecessary, and where no existing revocation has been identified at this stage of the research. They are not saved by the saver in section 2 and thus will cease to be in force following enactment of this Bill. Other instruments that do not relate to Ireland or have only a tenuous connection with Ireland will not be included in Schedule 2 but will be revoked by virtue of the general revocation in section 2. Having regard to the volume of legislation involved and the careful analysis given to each instrument, it is clear that this Bill is the culmination of a significant programme of work. Indeed, over a 13-year period the Statute Law Revision programme has produced five Bills and completed a meticulous examination of 60,000 Acts of Parliament and many thousand secondary instruments. It has required meticulous research which has underpinned further modernisation and accessibility measures. It enables the Law Reform Commission to make available electronically the majority of Acts that were retained by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007. For the first time, most of the pre-1922 public general Acts that remain in force are now available electronically. In addition, the statute law revision programme has provided assistance to other Departments in relation to the repeal and re-enactment in modern form of pre-1922 Acts in some subsequent sector-specific legislation. The project staff also received texts of legal instruments and valuable assistance and co-operation from the Oireachtas Library and the National Library. I wish to express my gratitude to those institutions for their continued support and assistance.  This Bill is somewhat technical in nature, requiring a detailed outline of its provisions, but all of us in this House and in the other House, as custodians of the Irish Statute Book, have a duty to ensure the book is modernised and that unnecessary or obsolete elements are removed to make it accessible and transparent and to enable the public to interact with the laws of their land as they go about their business. The Bill we are debating on Second Stage today is a significant step on a journey which has been taking place for the past 13 years. I look forward to the debate in this and the other House and to the subsequent passage of the Bill.

I commend the staff who worked on the Bill because, undoubtedly, much research is involved in going back through the Statute Book and assessing what needs to be included and what needs to be revoked. It is a fine piece of work which will be welcomed by many who have to work with the Statute Book on a daily basis. The purpose of the Bill is to clarify and simplify the Irish Statute Book and it will make it easier for people to locate statutes and ascertain relevant laws. It follows on from the recent Statute Law Revision Acts 2005 to 2012, which have already repealed thousands of obsolete pre-1922 laws and statutes. Statute law revision was a stated aim of the programme for Government and it is good to see that work is continuing in this regard. This Bill achieves its aim by revoking statutory instruments passed prior to 1821 and which no longer have a purpose or relevance in our modern legal system. It includes a total of 5,708 instruments that have been identified as suitable for revocation. It provides a comprehensive list of those statutory instruments in Schedule 1 which were passed prior to 1821 and which will continue to have force after this Bill has been passed by the Houses. There are some 40 instruments which have been identified as requiring to be retained. It amends the Statutory Instruments Act 1947 to remove an exemption from publication of a number of statutory instruments or classes of statutory instrument. Overall, the Bill deals with statutes from May 1660 to November 1820 and includes instruments from the following legislative sources: Irish instruments from 1169 to 1800; instruments of England from 1066 to 1707; instruments of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800; instruments of the British Government in Ireland 1801-1820; and United Kingdom instruments 1801-1820. The Bill should have a minimal impact on our legislation but it will no doubt have a welcome impact on those who actually work in the profession and citizens generally who seek to understand and navigate Irish law. Some of the instruments being revoked by the Bill give a flavour of our history. They include declarations of war, to which the Minister of State referred, against Denmark in 1666 and against France in 1744 and a proclamation of 1817 reserving oatmeal and potatoes for consumption by the lower orders of people.Another example is a proclamation of 1661 prohibiting drunkenness, cursing, swearing and profaning on the Lord's day - it is not so bad if it happens during the rest of the week. A proclamation of 1676 concerns the hearing of claims of persons transplanted to Connacht and County Clare. A proclamation of 1665 appoints the first Wednesday of every month as a day of fasting and humiliation on account of the bubonic plague in London. A number of instruments impose restrictions on Catholics. For example, a proclamation of 1679 promises a reward for the apprehension of any Popish dignitary or Jesuit. There is an order of the same date for the suppression of mass houses. There is much there and one would glean much from our history by looking in detail at many of the statutory instruments being revoked by this Bill.  Our party will support this Bill as it proceeds through the House. Again, I offer our commendations and recognition to the staff who have worked diligently in bringing this Bill to fruition in the Dáil today.

Labhair mé cheana féin ar roinnt de na Billí eile a cuireadh chun cinn roimhe seo. Measaim gur maith an rud é go bhfuilimid ag bogadh ar aghaidh go tapaidh, sa deireadh thiar thall, maidir le fáil réidh le hAchtanna, forógraí agus dlíthe nach mbaineann leis an Stát seo in aon bhealach in aon chor. Ní chóir go mbeadh baint acu leis an Stát seo ó bunaíodh é, ar a laghad. It is welcome that we are continuing the progress made of late to once and for all create an Irish Statute Book that is relevant, modern and accessible. One of my interests is history and we will return to that when I go into the details of the Bill itself. The job that has been done should have been done or begun in 1922 when the State was founded or, at the very least, when the State became a republic. It involves setting aside the laws, proclamations and statutory instruments that belong to another time. We are in that process at last. I understand the complications and that the Government cannot change legislation that has an impact overnight, for example, that relating to currencies and a range of other issues relating to property and title. However, we have grown up as a State to the point where it is appropriate that proclamations and statutory instruments cannot masquerade as law. They are not law. They are not live, have no relevance and are confined to history.  One advantage of this Bill is that it will create a Statute Book and associated instruments that can be accessible to the citizen given that we have the Internet. The idea is that the citizen is supposed to know what laws govern them. If one looks at some of these statutory instruments, one can see that they were proclamations of a different era where much of the public was not aware of the laws being created in Westminster and College Green on occasions. Most of these were not read by the Irish population in any shape or form and many of them were written in a language that was alien to them not just because they were not written as Gaeilge, but because the language in them was not accessible. It was an English vernacular that was not the vernacular of the Irish people. This echoes some of our criticism today about legislation, which is that it is not available in plain English. It is hoped that once we have finished with this, we can then start at the beginning and see whether we can address how inaccessible some of our legislation is to the public.  I have criticised the fact that legislation and explanatory memoranda are not available in the Irish language. Even this Bill is not available in the Irish language. This legislation is quite detailed. A promise was made by the Tánaiste to produce explanatory memoranda as Gaeilge. If this had been done, other Deputies and I would have found it easier to debate this as Gaeilge.  My other main criticism of this concerns the use of JobBridge. I argued with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform about this in respect of a previous Bill. I know the defence the Minister made but if there is a job to be done, it should be a paid job. Using JobBridge was wrong in this project even if it enabled participants to gain experience because it is not a long-term job. Funding should have been made available to ensure that those who were qualified received the rate commensurate with the job. It is a very difficult and onerous job. We must take it on trust that all of the instruments, or as many of them as could be found, are contained in this Bill. We might come back in ten years time to find that somebody has discovered a few thousand bits and pieces. I do not think this will happen because I have met some of those involved in the project and they were enthusiastic and went beyond the call of duty on occasions to find the original manuscripts. I presume all of the legislation that is now being repealed is somewhere in the Department. It would be a very interesting and useful tool for current and future historians if all that revoked legislation was available in one source document. The repealed Irish Statute Book might be an interesting name for it.  As the Minister of State, others and some commentators in the media have said, some of this legislation is amazing. It bears no relationship to the current day or at least to the way our society is run. I remember one piece of legislation that stated that in order to get a divorce, a person had to get legislation passed in Parliament. It is not relevant to this Parliament. I find it strange that we still keep 40 instruments, one or two of which might have a logic to them. In a republic, I am not one for titles, pomp and ceremony. Citizens are supposed to be equal. Quite a number of the 40 instruments concern the transfer of names, basically titles, to allow succession. At this stage, I believe most of them are irrelevant but they are interesting. Perhaps the Minister of State can explain why we are retaining the 40 instruments because there are very few that deal with anything else. I presume the instrument concerning the Bank of Ireland was the order setting it up. Given that it was in 1624, I do not see the relevance of the proclamation concerning ambassadors and foreign Ministers.Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister of State will have time to elaborate further on each of them. The others are of interest only because they are being revoked. I would not want any of them to be retained, in particular those in which, as a historian, I have an interest in so far as they deal with the Penal Laws and the manner in which the British in particular sought to culturally annihilate the Irish people. They are quite specific. Most people presume that the Penal Laws relate to the early 18th century. However, it is evident from the proclamations dealt with in this Bill they date back to the 16th century and are specifically targeted, on a religious basis, at papists. Anybody who had the gall to rise up against them had their land confiscated. A series of these proclamations were made in the 1560s in relation to Shane O'Neill. As I said earlier, these are of historical interest. It is hoped they will be available in one source online. Before I stray too deeply into historical matters, I would like to address the change being made to section 6, which is logical, to remove the obligation on the State to provide the Chambers of Commerce etc. with the legislation. The list in this regard includes the National Library of Ireland, the Law Library, the King's Inn Library, the Law Society of Ireland, the Southern Law Association, which I presume is the confederates in Cork - I do not understand the difference: perhaps a Cork man can explain to me why they stand out from the rest - and the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford Chambers of Commerce. We have moved on from this. If I were to make any suggestion, it would be that some of the universities should be included in that list. Everything is now available online. This is a recognition that within hours of legislation being passed, and even prior to it being passed, it is available online to students and practitioners of law. For this reason the proposed change is appropriate. There is one particular issue of concern to me. The derogation in relation to the Defence Act is to be retained. I have not researched in detail the reason this derogation is to remain separate. Why does this apply only to the Defence Forces and not the Garda Síochána? Is there a particular reason for this such as, say, the secrecy of declarations of war and so on? I do not understand why statutory instruments related to the Defence Forces would be subject to greater secrecy than statutory instruments related to operational matters of An Garda Síochána. Given where we are as a society today, this strikes me as interesting. This is dream legislation to any historian. Once one delves into it one finds interesting nuggets. Even though in many instances all one now gets is the new citations, these are welcome because some of the proclamations had no citations and would not have been accessible. We now have citations relating to proclamations on phrases such as "To Hell or to Connaught", which most people presume relates to the movement of people out of Dublin and Leinster and into Connemara. However, the "To Hell...." part of the phrase is interesting. There is a declaration abolishing transplantation to the West Indies. The West Indies was "Hell". Montserrat is in the West Indies. It was almost destroyed by a volcano a number of years ago. In terms of the phrase "To Hell or to Connaught", those who were not willing to go to Connaught were put in boats as slaves and sent to the plantations in the West Indies. The declaration I referred to earlier ended that practice. There are other declarations that refer to the offering of a reward of £5 for the discovery and punishment of Jesuits and seminary priests. There is a declaration setting out the means for conversion of the Irish and the elimination of the Irish language. These proclamations, we were taught in school, formed part of the Penal Laws. However, they did not. The Penal Laws followed. These are the laws that applied prior to some of the harshest Penal Laws. There is a period of 100 years when different groups of laws applied. These are more to do with Oliver Cromwell's time. The number of them introduced in 1655 in particular is interesting. There are others which are not necessarily interesting in terms of national history but would be interesting to local historians. For example, there is a proclamation which banned the use of a well in Rathfarnham. No. 126 on the list is a proclamation inhibiting resorting to the well near Rathfarnham upon pain of death. It would be interesting to know if that was because the well was poisoned or if it was because the well was to be exclusively retained by the landlord there. That is perhaps a job of work for a local historian. Perhaps we will see something related to that in History Ireland in the future. There is also a proclamation banning Easter because of drunkenness and debauchery and so on. It is not only in recent times that there has been drunkenness around religious festivals such as St. Patrick's Day and so on. Back in the 1560s the Irish were enjoying themselves and those who were in charge, many of whom were puritanical, did not take too kindly the celebration of religious feasts, particularly religious feasts that cut across some of their declarations. In terms of Leinster House, in 1798 a proclamation was issued promising a reward for the discovery of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, who was wanted for high treason. Leinster House was raided by the Red Coats because his brother was the owner of this building and its surrounding land. However, this proclamation is now being repealed. I do not think anybody ever claimed that reward.

As I said, I welcome this legislation. I wish the team well for the future in terms of the work that remains to be done, as set out earlier by the Minister of State, in relation to the drafting of three or four more Bills dealing with this issue, although they will not be as detailed or as lengthy as this one. One of the Bills to follow will deal with the post-1920 period, information on which is hopefully more accessible. It should be remembered, however, that some records for this period have been lost or were never filed properly. In terms of records pre-1922 the burning of the Custom House and the attack on the Four Courts during the Civil War led to the destruction of many of them. Many supplementary documents were lost. In some cases, we will never have complete documents.However, once this project is finished, we have a job to do to make our legislation accessible, by using easy to understand language. Not only should we have all statute law in one place but perhaps we should have all explanatory memoranda in the same place so that people can at least gain some insight into some of the complicated language involved. The more we consolidate Acts, the easier it will be for practitioners, whether in this House or in the courts, to argue cases. The consolidated Bill on the sale of alcohol is due, as is the consolidated Bill on social welfare. The work is done bit by bit and it will make it easier in that one will not be jumping from one piece of legislation to another. At least now we can discount everything, bar the 40 instruments included in this legislation and those in the three or four previous Statute Law Revision Acts. I might have questions on Committee Stage, mainly relating to what is left and what is being retained. I also mentioned the Defence Forces and the organisations which receive legislation when published, as a right. I do not know how much detail the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, received in this regard. I hope he did not get too much because several thousand pieces of secondary legislation are referred to in this Bill. Giving citations to each of them is useful and that can be done in a short period. I thank the Minister of State and previous Ministers who have undertaken this work and wish the part of the Department which has undertaken it well. I hope we will see the next Bill as soon as possible so that the work is completed and we can move on to other work, although as a historian, I love to delve into this. There are months, if not years, of work there for local and national historians if it is all online in the future.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, for the opportunity to speak on the Statute Law Revision Bill 2015. I welcome this debate as I see it as part of the reform agenda. I will support anything to do with genuine reform and change, as Irish politics needs an urgent shot in the arm. Fresh, new and radical thinking is urgently needed in a rapidly changing world. However, we need to get on with this reform and this Bill is part of that process. The Statute Law Revision Bill 2015 continues the recent process of cleaning up the Statute Book. It also revokes legislation which no longer has purpose or relevance in the modern Irish legal system. Again, this is part of the reform agenda. Specifically, the Bill addresses secondary instruments and provides a comprehensive list of secondary instruments from the period covered which continue to have force after the passing of the Bill. This Bill will also revoke all remaining obsolete secondary instruments passed prior to 1821.  The Bill deals specifically with Irish instruments from 1169 to 1800; instruments of England from 1066 to 1707; instruments of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800; instruments of the British Government in Ireland from 1801 to 1820; and United Kingdom instruments from 1801 to 1820. It involves a lot detail and covers a lot of legislation and a lot of history and it is important we reflect on these issues in this debate. When one zooms in on the sections dealing with period from 1661 to 1820, very interesting issues arise - for example, the varied instruments regarding the status of Catholics, including a 1661 proclamation "requiring innocent Catholics to put in their claims to be restored to their lands", a proclamation "suppressing unlawful assemblies of Catholics and dissenters" and a proclamation "declaring the King's Letter permitting Roman Catholics to live and trade in towns". There are also instruments relating to expulsion of priests, suppression of institutions, surrender of arms and limitations on travel and where to live. That gives one an indication of what was going on historically in the country. When one looks at this now in the cold light of day, one thinks of the discrimination and second-class citizenship that existed in our State. That is why we have to be conscious when talking about building a modern new Ireland and a new Republic of these times when Catholics were discriminated against and treated as second-class citizens. In the current debate on marriage equality, we should reflect on that argument as well. If one believes in a modern inclusive Ireland and a democratic Republic, one must ensure that all citizens are treated equally and marriage equality is part of that agenda and it is important we say so. If we do not learn from history, from where do we learn? The Minister of State, Deputy Harris, will like the following. There are numerous instruments regarding the collection and payment of customs, excise and taxes, along with regulation of imports. These include instruments providing certain exemptions. One such example from 1778 is a proclamation promising a pardon to persons guilty of customs offences who voluntarily joined the Royal Navy - in other words, if a person dodged his taxes but joined the Royal Navy, went off to war to kill somebody or die for somebody, he would get a tax amnesty. That is the kind of thing we are learning. I hope the Minister of State is not getting any ideas for those who do not pay their taxes or maybe people protesting about the water charges. I note the reference to the Royal Navy and the emphasis on militarisation. It is also relevant to the protest yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Clare Daly, in that international peace activists must be respected and given maximum support because they are doing us a great service. If it happened in 1778, there might have been a different reaction from the so-called forces of law and order. When dealing with this legislation, it is important to be conscious of militarisation at the time. There are numerous instruments relating to the armed forces and conflicts, some of which are diplomatic and militaristic, both national and international, which are important. Another interesting instrument is that in 1678 a proclamation ordered "that taverns, tippling houses and tobacco shops be removed from the vaults and cellars of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin". Even in 1678, the poor smokers were getting a hard time. In December 1757, a proclamation was published in the Dublin Gazette "from the Lord Mayor providing that the peace and good order of the city be preserved during the Christmas holidays." I hope people are listening to that today as it is relevant to the anti-social behaviour debate in this country. In the Bill there are sections highlighting the oatmeal and potatoes order of 1817, which was introduced during the economic depression following the Napoleonic Wars to ease price inflation. Anyone not in the lower classes was ordered to desist from eating them or feeding them to horses, especially horses for pleasure. That was in 1817. Again, this was a reflection of the time and the attitude towards poorer and more vulnerable sections of society. The bottom line is that overall this legislation is important. I gather from the Minister of State that the good news, from a financial point of view, is that there are no extra Exchequer costs. In fact, certain implications could produce savings in legal and business costs overall, and that is positive. I know that as a numbers-and-figures man the Minister of State will be delighted with that. I welcome the broader debate and the fact that we are trying to deal with this issue. We are cleaning up the Statute Book and that is a positive development.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	The Minister of State will be delighted to learn that I will not be taking my full time in this slot. Without disrespecting anyone involved in the process, it has been said by someone in my office that this legislation is a bit like a mega-snoozefest. That is not to be disrespectful. It is titillating and amusing to look back at some of these old statutes and laugh at how things used to be done and so on. Obviously, no one is going to object to having them tidied up. However, it is somewhat ironic and it sums up in many ways the irrelevance of this Parliament and how out of touch it is that we are giving time to discuss this now. Undoubtedly, the Dáil will close early today. There will not be too many people speaking on this because, really, what can one say about it? At the same time, the attention of the nation is engaged with the sale of Siteserv and the controversy around that. We really should be given time to discuss that instead. While I am delighted that there is a row between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and his former colleague, Mr. Dukes - it is nice to see that coming to the surface - we should really be using time in the House to discuss these issues rather than anything else. There is a certain irony in that situation. We have before us a Bill in which 5,702 instruments are being revoked. All of these are secondary instruments and include the likes of a proclamation giving currency to new pieces of silver money or a proclamation providing for the election of a new Scottish peer and so on. It is grand that they are all being tidied up and scrubbed. The more interesting elements are the ones being retained. The vast majority of these relate to names and coats of arms, such as the licence to William Burton to use the surname and arms of Conyngham. We wonder what is so important about William Burton's relatives and why they get to carry the name and arms of Conyngham. Perhaps the Minister of State can enlighten us on that later on. For me the more important matter is the retention of the historic statute in Irish law that is a proclamation against illegal warrants by some sheriffs and justices of the peace which omit to name the persons against whom they are granted. We are to retain that, and I do not have a problem with that - in fact, I am pleased - but it is a sad irony that we are maintaining that proclamation in the same week in which the Supreme Court gave a judgment on the State's application to allow evidence gathered in a way that breaches an individual's constitutional rights, and that such evidence would be admissible in court. The State's case hinged around a warrant which had been obtained by unconstitutional means. The original trial judge said that she could not consider any evidence obtained under that search warrant because the warrant had breached the defendant's constitutional rights, and correctly so. The State wanted a conviction and, therefore, went to the Supreme Court to seek a change in the law in order that the individual could be retried and convicted. The State got the law changed in what the Supreme Court judge Mr. Justice Adrian Hardiman described in his dissenting judgment as an abhorrence that is unique in the entire world. I agree with him. This is an incredibly serious development. The statute that we are voting to retain, relating to sheriffs not being allowed to issue illegal warrants, is being contradicted by the Supreme Court, which is allowing the Garda to get evidence by unlawful means and to use it against citizens. It is an incredible situation. We should really be discussing these issues in the House, because this is real live Irish law that could have real implications on the lives of Irish citizens today. Mr. Justice Hardiman described the result as one achieved through gamesmanship of the worst and most cynical kind by the State. There is a contradiction here because, at a time when we are talking about Garda reform and the need for gardaí to adhere to the best international practice, to dot i's and cross t's and to be human rights complaint and so on, the Supreme Court is saying that a garda can obtain evidence and then say she did not know that when she was getting it she was doing so by unlawful means and, further, that breaching somebody else's constitutional rights and pleading ignorance is allowable. In fact, ignorance is being rewarded in this instance. This is a grave development and, in that sense, I am keen to use this time to put on the record the seriousness of this issue. I am keen to highlight the fact that there is an irony in retaining the statute on the sheriffs and their illegal warrants, which was one of only 40, out of approximately 6,000, that are not being revoked. Yet at the same time the State is ensuring that rules can be broken. It is also a little ironic that we are allowing time for what are in effect dead elements of statute that will never be invoked, while not allowing time for real, living, important issues such as the repeal of the eighth amendment of the Constitution. These are the real issues that we need to address and engage with the population on, rather than legislation which is in effect dead. Of course it needs to be tidied up, and I salute the efforts of people who are involved in the project. It is a worthy historical project, but it is not worthy of our time in this House when there are so many vital issues that the Government is ignoring and not allowing time for in the House.

This Bill comes as a result of a number of years of painstaking work. I am keen to take the opportunity to commend the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the extensive and far-reaching body of research into statutes and proclamations that remain in effect and are required to be revoked. These instruments cover hundreds of years of our history and a broad range of subject matter. Even the most cursory reading of the Bill reflects our past in all its richness and in its darkest times. It reflects a time when there was a monarch, a parliament that voted itself out of existence, a Europe in turmoil, a country in turmoil and armies raised to fight foreign wars on behalf of a foreign king. There were rewards on the heads of criminals and patriots alike. There were offers of pardon to encourage informers to come forward as a means of imposing given views of justice on Ireland. All of the history of the English monarchy as it affected Ireland is contained within the Bill. It is reflected in statutes, proclamations and treaties, in wars and instruments to celebrate accessions, births, deaths and marriages of monarchs as well as to mourn their passing. I do not believe there is anyone in Ireland who at this point in our history mourns the passing of foreign monarchy. There was a parliament that represented an elite class who, through the Penal Laws, made the biggest land grab in our history.This land grab was done to break the Irish people and to take from them their birthright and historic lands. These lands were granted by the English monarchy to the very agents who engaged in wars here, in Great Britain and on the Continent in the service of the crown. The Irish people paid the price for these wars. Thus, the Home Rule movement, the rack-rent and the absentee landlord emerged as features of our history which took centuries to unwind. The Parliament was unrepresentative, undemocratic and, indeed, voted itself out of existence to facilitate the Act of Union in 1800. The instruments being revoked by this Bill contain the mundane day-to-day administration of Government which echoes the economic circumstances, the structure of the administration and how this was progressed. One can see duties being imposed on imports, bans on imports, restrictions on sea traffic and isolation of vessels. As it seems I have left some of my speech behind on my desk, I will conclude. It is clearly time that we revoked many of these instruments. I noted from the earlier comments of Members on all sides of the House that there is a warm welcome for all aspects of the Bill. I anticipate and hope it will get safe passage through the Houses, and I look forward to that in time.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	I thank the Deputies from all sides of the House for the very constructive contributions we have had on this Bill and for the considered views that have been expressed during the debate. I do not expect many people in Deputy Daly's office to agree with me on many issues. However, I would like to challenge that individual within her office, whose view she shared with the House and who considers this Bill to be a snoozefest. It really depends on what one views the job of a legislator to be. As I outlined in my opening contribution, and I was pleased to see so many speakers from other sides of the House outlining this as well, while we tend to focus on the creation of new legislation in this House, and that is very important, we must also be mindful of our obligations as legislators and as representatives of the citizens of this country on the need to remove that which is no longer relevant and, therefore, should be removed. I note that this process and the benefit of the work of the statute law revision programme, which has been going on for some years, has been recognised by the House. Deputy Daly referred to this as "historical". It is anything but. Deputy Ó Snodaigh probably does not expect me to say this but I very much enjoyed his contribution because I find the historical aspects are fascinating because they open so many questions, both at a national level about our history and also, as he rightly illustrated, at very local and community levels, where people will pick up nuggets and insights into their own past and potential projects and community ventures that can be pursued in terms of further exploring that. The Bill is much more than just historical. When Government was considering this legislation, and one can only presume when previous Governments were considering it, it could be seen that there are a number of benefits to citizens in its current form. For example, there are benefits to our competitiveness. I believe the legislation and, indeed, the entire programme can have a direct effect on our national competitiveness by cutting costs associated with doing business and for industry in establishing their legal rights and obligations. We keep saying we want this country to be the best place in a world in which to do business. Bills like this make a difference in terms of our competitiveness and reducing red tape. The Bill has positive implications for quality regulation, employment, industry and small businesses in that the proposals will assist the burden on those users in regard to how they interact with our Statute Book. I believe the whole revision programme, which has been going on for 13 years now and has been progressing quite well, will simplify the Statute Book and is intended to reduce legal costs and business transaction costs. Furthermore, law should not be written just to be understood or comprehended by lawyers or by courts. It is the law that is owned by all of our citizens. There is a duty on all of us in this House, on all sides and regardless of our political views, to make sure that the Irish Statute Book is accessible to everybody and that a person should not have to have a PhD to read it. Improved accessibility of the Statute Book will bring additional benefits to those who have difficulties in accessing the law, such as the socially excluded and vulnerable people and I would go so far as to say to all citizens who have an interest in ascertaining their rights and responsibilities under the law in the Republic in which they live. I do not accept that the Bill is historical, while there is clearly an historical element that one comes across when debating it. This Bill will greatly assist citizens in establishing the exact nature of their rights and obligations, which may currently be either unknown, unclear or harder to ascertain as a result of obsolete and unnecessary former laws and secondary instruments on the Statute Book. I look forward to further debate in the House on the Bill. The adoption of the Bill would lighten the compliance burden on both business and citizens, and allow them to concentrate their efforts as they interact with the State on the law that is relevant to them and to this country in its modern day. There were several interesting questions, some of which we will return to on Committee Stage to tease out. The issue of licence for granting of arms being retained was a fair point raised by Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Daly. To clarify, the Bill retains in Schedule 1 a number of licences which authorise the use of a particular name and arms which were granted to specific Irish people. As the instruments confer ongoing rights, they are not suitable for revocation in the Statue Law Revision Bill. The grant of arms continues to be dealt with by the Genealogical Office in the National Library and remains relevant in the present day. Licences which relate to the use of a name only, rather than name and arms, are being revoked as the change of the use of surnames is not legally regulated at present, so there is no necessity for these licences to remain in force. It is not being done for that reason, and I hope this provides some clarity in that regard. In regard to the next steps, it is important to acknowledge that while the Bill is a very important step, and I have outlined why I believe it has current benefits for citizens, I am pleased to advise the House that work is already well underway on the next Bill, which will repeal spent and obsolete Acts enacted post-1922, and work has commenced on a further Bill to drive the review of secondary instruments forward, to continue on from the Bill dealing with that period. As far as this Bill is concerned, it will achieve the repeal of what is objectively a huge volume of spent or obsolete legal instruments. The removal of these instruments represents another important step towards the aim of a clear and concise Statute Book which reduces the regulatory burden on businesses and citizens and enhances accessibility for the general public. I look forward to exploring further and discussing with Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others on Committee Stage some of the points that have been made in regard to whether we can make revoked material available and easily accessible. There are practical difficulties in that, as I am sure the Deputy can appreciate. However, let us certainly have that discussion and explore it. In concluding the Second Stage debate, I make the point that this Bill is clearly not the end of the process - far from it. However, it constitutes another milestone in the creation of a modern and accessible Statute Book and it paves the way for further modernisation measures that we can build on from this Bill and the assessment of more recent legislation. I understand Committee Stage is due on 5 May. I look forward to it being taken on that occasion and to further interaction with Members on all sides of the House. I thank Deputies for the expressions of gratitude for the great work that has been undertaken by the team of officials over a sustained period of time. It is great that this work is continuing to bear fruit. I commend the passage of Second Stage.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	As the Tánaiste knows, over the past number of days the sale of Siteserv by IBRC to Millington, an Isle of Man company owned by Denis O'Brien, has been the subject of much controversy. At the time of the sale, it was in debt of up to €150 million. It installed Sky boxes, fixed traffic lights and had contracts with the ESB and Bord Gáis Energy. After the sale, it went on to win a large contract to install water meters. We know from documents revealed to Deputy Catherine Murphy and The Sunday Times that the civil servants in the Department of Finance had very serious concerns about the sale and transaction. They were concerned that the decision to allow the sale process to be run by Siteserv's advisers was an issue for them. They were concerned about the decision to exclude trade buyers from the process, the limit of the exclusivity period when there were other bids outstanding and the payment of €5 million to the shareholders of a company that was essentially bust. We know that Anchorage, a multimillion euro company, submitted a higher bid of €52 million which for some reason was not accepted. Another large company, Altrad, publicly complained at the time that it had been shut out of the bidding process and felt the company was worth about €60 million. The civil servants went on to say that they were extremely concerned about the number of large transactions that had been poorly executed by the bank and its management. The civil servants said this was damaging the credibility of the State and the bank and asked the Minister if he would conduct an independent review or ask the chairman of the board to do so. For some reason the Minister did not pursue that recommendation. He met the chairman of the board and the chief executive officer in July and they gave assurances that everything was okay and it was the best deal possible. That is a trend. In previous publications everybody is assuring everybody that everything is fine, but we do not know on what basis the Minister, Deputy Noonan, accepted the assurances of Mr. Dukes. We do not know on what basis the board continued saying it was the best deal. I ask the Tánaiste to show us how it was the best deal. Yesterday, the Taoiseach said during Leaders' Questions that the Comptroller and Auditor General would look at this from the perspective of value for money. We heard today that Mr. Dukes disputes the Minister's statement to the House to the effect that Mr. John Moran, the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, asked Mr. Aynsley about establishing an inquiry. He said he was never asked and it was never discussed at the August 2012 meeting. I would like those issues to be clarified. Is the Tánaiste comfortable with what has been revealed about this deal? Would she accept that the public should know more about it and we should have far more transparency? In the words of the Taoiseach, Paddy likes to know.

The only effective way to deal with this comprehensively would be to have an effective and quick commission of investigation inquiry, under the existing relevant legislation, into all aspects of this deal and the other large transactions the Department of Finance officials had such grave concerns about. The Tánaiste might clarify the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General in all of this.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	I note the very valuable work done by Deputy Catherine Murphy on this. I am in favour of a review of Siteserv and any transactions of equal magnitude that may also be worthy of inquiry. I want to be absolutely clear. I would like to see an independent inquiry by a competent authority, which is the way to get the correct and honest answers on any issue like this. I have heard the suggestions in regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts and I am aware that there may have to be a change in legislation if it was to be facilitated. In the past, the Comptroller and Auditor General has played a very valuable role in scoping inquiries and investigations. It is a matter of identifying the best mechanism for a proper independent inquiry by a competent authority. I do not want to rule on that at this point in time because, as the Deputy has said, a certain amount of material has come into the public domain. The issue of the KPMG report arose in January 2011 during Deputy Martin's time in Government. It concerned Siteserv and was a review of the strategic options for the business and the debt situation vis-à-vis IBRC. That was during the Deputy's time in government and I am sure he is probably familiar with that period. In February 2011, there were meetings between IBRC, Siteserv and KPMG to discuss the findings of the KPMG report. Again, I am sure the Deputy would have been fully aware of that, if not then perhaps now, because he was a prominent member of the Government. On 7 March 2011, PWC was engaged by IBRC to review the KPMG report and advise it on debt recovery strategies. I am sure the Deputy would agree that it is necessary to look at the totality of all of this matter. He raised a number of issues around payments to certain shareholders. Another issue he should take into account is that more than shareholders were involved in this.There were more than 1,500 people working in the company. Now, after its having been acquired, there are over 3,000 people working in it. I would have imagined that at the time, from the perspectives of the former Government and the current one, a very significant issue would have been not only the shareholders but also people working in the business. I am sure that was a concern of Deputy Martin when he was a Minister.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	We are completely in the dark about the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Taoiseach came into the House yesterday and almost plucked something out of the cloud, saying he chatted with the Minister that morning and believed the Comptroller and Auditor General could carry out a value-for-money investigation. The Comptroller and Auditor General could not carry out the comprehensive investigation that a commission of investigation could carry out, and that is why the legislation was enacted. We need clarity from the Government urgently on what it is going to do. We are getting conflicting accounts from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in regard to what kind of review or investigation we are talking about. I have no difficulty at all with the totality. The reason there should be a commission of investigation is that it would engage with the totality. The idea that €5 million would be paid to directors or shareholders of a bust company is fundamentally wrong from any moral perspective and raises all sorts of alarms. This must be put to the Tánaiste, particularly given that so much money was owed to the taxpayer. The fundamental issue is that the taxpayer lost €105 million overall in the deal. This must be juxtaposed with the €5 million the shareholders received and the issue of other companies bidding higher. This was all in March 2012. There is a fundamental obligation to get to the bottom of this. That obligation is to the taxpayers and citizens. That is the core issue. On what basis was the Minister for Finance satisfied the best deal was done? I do not know the answer based on any of the documentation or publications I have read so far. A very good article by Tom Lyons in the Sunday Independent of April 2012 dealing with all the circumstances surrounding the sale, the meeting with the shareholders and the related press briefing raised more questions than answers. Even when one reads that, the message from the Government is that it should be trusted and that we should be assured everything is fine. There is no detail on why everything was fine and why the deal was regarded as the best. In terms of compellability and documentation, the only way to get to the bottom of this is by a commission of investigation.

I do not know whether Deputy Martin took much interest when the construction industry and many major businesses collapsed. I do not know the detailed background to the Siteserv but presume the company was among many construction companies and trades, allied to construction, that ended up with unsustainable debt and, therefore, ended up, in Deputy Martin's time in government, under the remit of IBRC. That is all I am saying to the Deputy. It was his Government's policies that led to what occurred, not only to Siteserv but also many others. The Deputy has made a case with which the Minister for Finance and I agree, because when the officials in the Department of Finance brought concerns to the Minister's attention, there was in place, as the Deputy knows, a relationships framework that was put together by the late Brian Lenihan, the former Minister for Finance. The current Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, expressly undertook to inquire into the concerns raised by the officials in the Department. Siteserv was one of many companies in severe financial meltdown and crisis. I presume the review by KPMG from January 2011, in the overall context of IBRC and the disaster that was Anglo Irish Bank, was an attempt to determine what could be salvaged from the company, particularly the jobs of people employed in it-----

Deputy Martin wants all of this examined. I have no difficulty with that and am perfectly happy with it but I would like to see the matter examined by a competent authority. I would like to see all the matters reviewed and would like to ensure it happens in a reasonable timeframe. The Comptroller and Auditor General was mentioned. The Comptroller and Auditor General has previously done valuable scoping work in regard to inquiries. That is an historical fact.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	The Comptroller and Auditor General has made it absolutely clear that he and his office have no remit or authority in respect of IBRC. Therefore, when the Tánaiste appeals for a competent and appropriate authority, she should realise she is citing an office that is not capable of carrying out the investigation and does not have the remit to do so. I wonder why she is doing that. We know Siteserv was sold off for €45 million. We know this was at a cost to the taxpayer of €105 million. That is a lot of money. We know the same legal advisers acted for both the purchaser and seller, and that shareholders got a sweetener of €5 million to ensure the deal went ahead. We know the Denis O'Brien company was not the highest bidder but yet emerged as the successful bidder. We know the Minister for Finance was briefed by the Department on serious concerns over this transaction and briefed equally on broader concerns over other transactions and the modus operandi of IBRC. As the Tánaiste knows, the Siteserv deal is not the only one that saw debt written down. More than €64 million was written off in Blue Ocean Associates before being purchased by a consortium, also involving Denis O'Brien, as it happens. There was an almost 50% write-down of €300 million in debts in the purchase of Topaz. As it happens, Mr. O'Brien is also involved in this.

At this stage, it is causing considerable public disquiet.People want to know what was going on with Siteserv specifically, but more broadly with the operation of IBRC. We want to know what these big problematic transactions were, their value, the cost to the taxpayer and the people involved, namely, the bidders and the successful bidders. People want to know why a civil servant or civil servants were ignored, why their advice was set aside or, astonishingly, overridden by a simple assurance given by Alan Dukes. People want to hear from the Tánaiste not some clever formula of words to kick the can down the road; we want to hear this morning that she will commit to a commission of inquiry.

That was what was going on, major job losses and the destruction of the construction industry in Ireland, and with it the almost destruction of the economy. That is what was going on.

I have said to her and Deputy Martin very plainly, and I want to repeat it to her in case she was not listening, that I want to see an independent inquiry by a competent authority. There are a number of ways of doing this. This country has a great deal of experience of carrying out inquiries and investigations, and in some of those inquiries and investigations the offices and the resources of the Comptroller and Auditor General have been utilised on occasion, particularly in scoping matters. If the Deputy wants, as she claims, to get answers, one wants competence and to be able to inquire into all of the matters. What I said was that I do not have any difficulty if it is deemed necessary and appropriate to inquire into the additional matters she raised about a number of other companies she mentioned. What one has to do is examine this and determine how best to do it, and bear in mind that there were other issues which the Deputy is ignoring, such as the fact that 1,500 people were working in this company. Does she suggest that the company should just have been let go?

People want to know what was going on in IBRC. That is what I am putting to the Tánaiste. Some of the information and some of the concerns relating to IBRC have been raising their heads for some time, and I commend Deputy Murphy on her sterling work in bringing some of these matters to a head. I absolutely commend her on that.

We now know that what was hidden under the veil of commercial sensitivity were practices and deals which raised grave concerns within the Civil Service. I respectfully say the civil servants were not listened to. It seems the Minister, Deputy Noonan, took the say-so of Alan Dukes, let it be said a former leader of his party, Fine Gael, that everything was hunky-dory. I have to say to the Tánaiste this does not strike me as a very thorough going approach.

Those concerns are not new; they are long-standing. We need to know and we need to have a full examination of each and every one of them. I will quote words the Tánaiste said in 2012, and bear in mind that when she uttered these words, these deals were happening under the cloak of commercial sensitivity. She said it outrages ordinary citizens to see successive scandals being uncovered at enormous taxpayer expense and the same characters and plot lines popping up repeatedly. This is what we are seeing here, the same stories, the same characters and, it seems, the same utter disregard for the taxpayer. If the taxpayer had been front and centre in the case of Siteserv, certainly it would not have been a case of awarding the deal to a bidder other than the highest bidder, I would suggest to the Tánaiste.

The Deputy should think about that period of time for people in business in Ireland. Sinn Féin recently held talks with businessmen from America to reassure them about the business bona fides of the party but the reference to Ireland and the business goings-on at a time as hunky-dory is genuinely and seriously astonishing.

In fairness to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and Deputy McDonald is not noted in this House as somebody who is fair to anybody, I remember her colleague, Arthur Morgan, who was then a Sinn Féin Deputy, running down the stairs late at night to vote in favour of the bank guarantee. Her colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, who was then a Senator, did the same in the Seanad.

It surprises me that the Deputy suggested there is no basis in any business transaction for any level of commercial sensitivity. Anyone who has worked in business or even run a sweet shop for an afternoon would know there is commercial sensitivity but in the case of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, when civil servants in his Department raised issues, and if we want to be fair to him, he used the relationship framework. What was the relationship framework? The relationship framework was designed by Fianna Fáil and put in place by the late Brian Lenihan.

It was done not to have politicians directly running businesses. Deputy McDonald's and Sinn Féin's version is that there should be no relationship framework because presumably Sinn Féin politicians will run the businesses and then we know what would happen.

The Tánaiste does herself and her party no favours by the swaggering attitude she has displayed over the past half an hour. Can she try to focus on answering some of the questions put by the Opposition? The last time I used a literary term during Leaders' Questions, it caused the Tánaiste and Fine Gael some confusion. If these events showed up in the plot of a Franz Kafka novel, they would be considered over the top and too surreal. Even by the extremely low standards of crony capitalism in Ireland, this is scraping the barrel. These deals are incredible. As the leader of the Labour Party and the so-called watchdog in the Government, I ask the Tánaiste to address herself to why these happened under her watch and why we have not heard a peep from her all about them. That a man investigated by a State tribunal, which I assume the Tánaiste respects, a man we would think would be kept at arm's length from the Government and a man investigated following the awarding by a Fine Gael-led Government of a mobile phone licence, which is a licence to print money given that a five year old child could make money from a mobile phone licence, can end up acquiring a second company through any means is amazing and should be investigated. In the circumstances that have arisen, the Tánaiste should be demanding answers and not coming in here obfuscating and avoiding questions, never mind the fact there were other bidders and other issues into which I will go. The second company, which ends up into the hands of Denis O'Brien through GMC-Sierra, could also become another licence to print money if - this is a very big "if" - the Government can badger and bully the Irish people into paying water charges. That is worthy of investigation. The secret sale of the company has been raised in the House for years and on numerous occasions. Deputy Catherine Murphy has done us all a huge service and I commend her on her work. She and other Deputies raised it with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance. I raised it during Leaders' Questions and I had my microphone switched off. I hope it will not happen today. Denis O'Brien is so well connected to Fine Gael and owns such large swathes of the media that it has taken us this long to get this far.

Why was there no independent legal representation for the Irish taxpayer? The sale was processed by people with many connections to Siteserv in Davy and KPMG. The big question is why other bidders, making much larger offers, were not even considered. The only tender that included payments to directors was the Millington tender. If that is the case, why is it not in the interests of shareholders to take the bid? If it is true, this is obviously the company that was being positioned to get the water metering contract, which is a licence to print money if the Government can force through water charges. What other sweetheart deals took place, are happening or happened recently at Anglo from the Fine Gael backers? We have already heard about Topaz, the Beacon Hospital, etc. I am getting to the heart of the Government. The Tánaiste used to rant and rave when she was on this side of the House.

Does the Tánaiste agree that people looking at their water charge bills are totally justified in not paying them when they hear about the carry on and the people who will be enriched if water metering is forced through?

I do not know many of the names that were mentioned by the Deputy.

I repeat, for the Deputy's information, that I want to see an inquiry by a competent authority. Regarding people who have received water bills, as the Deputy is aware, well over 1 million people have registered with Irish Water.

The Minister for Finance inherited a relationship framework that was put in place by the previous Government and the Minister for Finance at the time. The purpose of that was to keep politicians at arm's length and for IBRC to conduct its ordinary business without any day-to-day interference by politicians in its affairs, so that it could successfully recover as much money as possible for the Irish taxpayer, salvage as many jobs and businesses as possible, and see those businesses survive and regrow with employment for the benefit of people in this country. That is what the business of the IBRC has been.

On 28 March 2012, she said this in the Dáil, "It is perhaps time for the Government to reflect on how it should in future interact with people against whom adverse findings have been made by tribunals [...] We live in a Republic and the representation of each citizen should be what counts rather than the amount of money a particular citizen can spend. We can look forward to a period of reform in which this Government will change the political landscape and our capacity to report and hold to account lobbyists." She did nothing. She could have changed the terms of reference of the IBRC and the winding down. She is right that Fianna Fáil set it up and that anything could happen, but she had a whole year to do something about it.

I make no apology for that, because in the world I live in, working class people actually need jobs, and the important thing is that they get jobs, that they get training and that they get apprenticeships and education, which enable them to become financially independent and to look after themselves and their families.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	Yesterday, the Taoiseach said the Comptroller and Auditor General had the legislative remit to investigate the Siteserv deal. Doubts have emerged about whether the legislative template exists for the Comptroller and Auditor General to do so. I raised it on yesterday's Order of Business and the Taoiseach indicated that it did. I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General is not in a position to carry out such an investigation and I would like the Tánaiste to indicate whether it is the Government's intention to change the legislation regarding the Comptroller and Auditor General to enable him to investigate it. Alternatively, would the Government consider the simpler route, namely, the establishment of a commission of investigation, which has already been provided for under the 2004 legislation, and which would facilitate an expeditious and efficient investigation of the issue and the concerns about other large transactions which the civil servants in the Department of Finance articulated to the Minister in 2012? There is no clarity regarding what legislative template will be used for the issue. Yesterday, the Taoiseach confused matters by mentioning the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Taoiseach did not seem to be well informed, although I might be wrong. It is important that we get clarity here about whether the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation allows for an investigation into the issue of how IBRC conducted transactions. The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts is very doubtful about it, as are other Deputies who have checked the legislation. This morning, Government spokespersons, including the Tánaiste, have spoken about some form of independent review and seem to be resiling from the proposal that the Comptroller and Auditor General would carry out the investigation. People do not want scoping exercises, but a very effective, expeditious investigation that will get to the bottom of it. Could the Government be more upfront about identifying the legislative template and the Government's commitment on it?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	I have an open mind on exactly how such an investigation would be done, provided it is an independent review by a competent authority. I saw the reports from yesterday and the references to the Comptroller and Auditor General. I do not know whether additional legislative provisions would have to be brought in here to give the Comptroller and Auditor General additional powers. While an investigation by a commission is a possibility, the Government would have to discuss it and make a decision on it. While no decision has been made, the Taoiseach would like the matter inquired into and I have made it clear that I want an independent review by a competent authority. There are several mechanisms that could be used, including the mechanism the Deputy has outlined.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	It is very clear that the Tánaiste is not keen on a full investigation. The Comptroller and Auditor General does not have the competence or authority to carry out what the Tánaiste is suggesting. Those are the words from the man's own mouth. The Tánaiste said she was not sure whether there would have to be a legislative change. She should be sure at this stage. It has been said repeatedly, including by the officeholder, that he has no remit whatsoever, high up or low down, in respect of IBRC, full stop. When does the Tánaiste propose to bring forward a motion establishing the investigative mechanism of which she speaks? I strongly urge that she use the 2004 legislation, which exists for this purpose. I raise the water services Bill every week. Although I never get answers, hope springs eternal, to use a water metaphor. We are told the water services Bill will address outstanding issues reflected in the Government's water package in November 2014. This is jargon or a euphemism for provisions to deduct unpaid water charges from people's wages, welfare payments or pensions. For months, I have raised this proposal that the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has championed, and I have never received a straight answer. When will the legislation be published?

I have a very serious issue to raise. On 23 May 2010, two young Tipperary men lost their lives off Helvick Head, leaving young families behind.They went out for a day's fishing and their boat capsized. I realise the Tánaiste does not have the details but I have written repeatedly to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and he has failed to respond. A public inquiry should be held into this matter. Four new witnesses came forward after the inquests and the investigation. I ask the Tánaiste to consider establishing either a commission of investigation or a sworn public inquiry. It was a tragedy. It was a beautiful day like today, but two young families were left without fathers. It is a serious matter, given that more witnesses have come forward. It was also featured on the RTE "Six One News" during the week. Will the Tánaiste ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to meet the families and to proceed with an investigation?

The ban was introduced by Fianna Fáil without putting an adequate compensation package or hardship fund in place.

I refer in particular to the adaptation grants for citizens with disabilities. In the Dublin City Council area there is a two year waiting list. A number of my constituents are desperately in need of housing adaptations. One constituent, Mr. Jack Lynam, is a double amputee who has been treated in hospital and his family must wait for two years, until 2017 or 2018, to get the necessary funding. Recently, the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, managed to secure additional funding. Will additional funding be provided for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and, specifically, Dublin City Council? Our other local authority, Fingal County Council, does not appear to have the same level of waiting list.

It will not, as far as I am aware. The matter the Deputy raised is important.

It is almost two years since the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes were discontinued, although recipients at the time are still in receipt of payments under the schemes.

When will they be brought forward? I raise this in the context of the concerns raised yesterday by the chairman of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, Mr. Frank Daly, about the quality of some of the housing in this country. Everybody is aware of the Priory Hall situation but in County Kildare at present the county council is examining an estate, Millfield Manor estate in Newbridge, in the aftermath of a dreadful fire that destroyed several homes. Will this legislation address the quality of the built environment, particularly in situations where public investment and, probably more significantly, public safety might be shown to be at risk?

In addition, when will the threatened legislation from the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, be brought to the House regarding the so-called proposal to fast-track non-payments through the court system, or is this just a figment of the Labour Party's imagination and being used as a fictitious threat against the boycott movement?

Is the Tánaiste aware of the problem with many homes in Donegal in respect of mica content in blocks which is causing the homes to fracture and crack? The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coffey, visited a number of the homes recently and the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, has been made aware of the problem. It is causing similar problems to those caused by pyrite in homes in the wider Dublin area. The model used to deal with pyrite - establishing an expert panel to assess the problem with a view to reporting to the Minister - would be opportune and appropriate in this instance. Are there plans to amend the Pyrite Resolution Act and is the Tánaiste aware of the issues in Donegal with regard to mica?

I will briefly explain the substance of this Bill. People with sight loss difficulties, reading and writing difficulties or capacity issues face additional obstacles when they want to vote. Some of these obstacles could be addressed through the development of an appropriate set of guidelines and practices that would ensure voting is accessible to all citizens who are entitled to vote in elections or referendums. The legislation I am proposing will operate alongside such guidelines and practices. It will give statutory footing to the facilitation of independent voting for people with sight loss. It aims to extend the capacity of people to engage in independent voting. It seeks to extend the time during which people with sight loss who want to vote with the assistance of a companion can do so, by reducing the timeframe during which the presiding officer can refuse to allow visually impaired voters to avail of their right to assistance. The Bill proposes to remove the word "blind" from electoral law. It is intended to encompass all visually impaired people who cannot vote independently due to sight loss. The Bill retains the categorisation of visually impaired people, together with those who cannot vote independently due to illiteracy or difficulties of incapacity. The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for independent voting by people who are visually impaired, people who have literacy issues and people who are incapacitated. It will allow such people to approach referendums through the use of a template. It will provide for independent voting at elections with the assistance of an electronic voting mechanism. The Bill will retain the option of voting with a companion. It will reduce the amount of time during which the presiding officer in a presidential or Dáil election can refuse a request by a visually impaired, incapacitated or illiterate voter to vote with the assistance of a companion. The Bill will operate together with the assisted voting provisions that are made available to visually impaired, incapacitated or illiterate voters. It will offer to them the additional option of voting independently following the provision of assistance or with no assistance at all. In conclusion, the Bill will operate alongside the wider guidelines. It will provide greater access opportunities to people who have challenges, particularly in the area of sight loss, or intellectual disabilities. I propose this legislation to the House.

People on the Government side of the House will be aware that many places are blighted by the presence of derelict sites. People in the affected neighbourhoods are frustrated by this problem. The substantial numbers of derelict sites in towns in my constituency, including Portlaoise, Mountrath, Rathdowney, Borris-in-Ossory, Portarlington, Mountmellick, Monasterevin and Ballinakill, are causing significant problems. Despite the efforts of Laois and Kildare County Councils, problems are still being encountered by those who are trying to get to grips with this issue. Local authorities are constrained in their efforts to deal with the growing number of such sites, which have mushroomed in recent years following the collapse in the property market. The anti-social activity that is associated with these unsightly locations - they are visually negative in terms of the upkeep of local areas - can be a source of nuisance in neighbourhoods. The Derelict Sites Act 1990 is not fit for purpose. It is nowhere near adequate to address the problem. The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, will be hearing that from councillors in his party, just as I am. We are all hearing it from the public. We are hearing from local authority officials, including at management level, that they have insufficient resources and powers to deal with this issue. The time span for the process through which the local authorities must go is often open-ended. The process has serious flaws because it is literally open-ended. The legislation as it stands is totally ineffective. The Bill I am proposing would narrow the relevant timeframe to 90 days. This would allow a local authority that has the will to do so to close off one of these sites within 90 days. The penalties provided for under the current legislation - the 1990 Act - are inadequate. A 3% levy is imposed at the point at which a levy can be imposed on these premises. We know it is an onerous task for local authorities to reach that point. Councillors are becoming increasingly frustrated with this. As well as proposing a shorter timeframe with definite cut-off times, so that these issues can be brought to a conclusion more quickly, I suggest that the penalty be increased to 5% in cases in which people do not comply. Many owners of derelict sites comply even though the value of those sites have decreased. They work with local authorities to clean the buildings and give them a facelift, perhaps pending their sale. The good news is that some people do comply. They are an increasing minority. The fact, however, is that too many owners of these locations do not engage. In many cases, the owners are financial institutions. We heard a great deal of talk here this morning about financial institutions. Some of these unsightly and dangerous buildings and sites are owned by banks. The banks are not registering them in their names. This means they cannot be penalised. We need to tighten the legislation by increasing the annual levy to 5% of the value of the site. At present, a maximum fine of €1,000 can be levied on a person who does not comply by engaging with the local authority in tidying it up or by paying the levy. I am proposing that it be possible for a fine of up to €10,000 to be imposed. Such a fine would not apply to every site, but it should be possible for a judge to impose it where he or she deems it necessary. We need to give that power to the Judiciary and the courts. It is not acceptable that it currently takes anything up to three years to get one of these locations entered on the derelict sites register. We must reduce that timeframe by providing for a cut-off time. We need to tighten up the legislation by increasing the power of local authorities, including officials and elected representatives, to intervene. We should provide for realistic penalties. We have to give local authorities the powers they need. As my party's spokesperson on local government, I plead with the Government to tighten up the existing legislation. I expect that every Member of the House hears about this issue every day of the week. We need to try to get on top of the problem of derelict sites, because it is blighting towns and villages right across the State.

#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	Since the taxi industry review and the announcement of a host of reforms and new regulations, a number of problems have arisen for drivers trying to make a living and operate within the law. Some of these problems were not obviously going to arise but some were fairly clearly going to come up and taxi drivers were telling us this from the word go. Some of these issues have again been brought to my attention by taxi drivers who feel they are getting nowhere with the regulatory authority, the NTA, and the taxi advisory committee. One issue which is raised across the board is the taxi decals, which were brought in for the sides of cars. These were hailed as a security measure to stamp out rogue taxis operating without a proper licence and to give confidence to passengers, but they have done neither. It is important that prospective customers can tell that a car driving by is a taxi for hire, but a taxi driver cannot now use their car in any private circumstance without people assuming that they are plying for hire. In the past, taxi drivers were able to remove their signage and place it in the boot or elsewhere and drive their car on their day off or on holidays as a private car. They were able to park up in towns or at their home and not be seen from a distance to be a taxi. To some, this might not seem important but for those who make their living as a taxi driver it is crucial for safety and comfort. With these decals a taxi is never not a taxi and this puts taxi drivers at risk for a number of reasons. I will illustrate the scenarios in which this becomes a problem. A car parked outside a home, advertising to the world that it is a taxi due to its decals, is a beacon to criminals who can expect the car or the home to have cash in higher sums than normal. This is especially the case when parked on the streets as taxis are more likely to have a stash of cash, expensive equipment or other things. It also provides information to anyone who might wish to clone the driver's licence as one can now quite easily find out a person's address from these decals. One may be a customer or just passing down a street. One driver showed me how it was possible to change the name of the driver attached to a certain car with use of the app and details from the decal and plate. Some people's details have been available even after they have passed away. One driver to whom I spoke had refused to use the decals on his brand new luxury car, which he invested in for his business, because he was worried that it would be damaged by sticking the decals to it, thus losing him money when it came to resale. The decals also cause problems when the car is used in a foreign country or even across the Border, drawing attention from potential undesirables or the police, who may be confused. One driver told me of driving to a town on a weekend night with his family and having people attempt to enter his car or flag him down in the street. Fortunately nothing more happened but it is not unusual for drunken people to cause problems for taxi drivers when they refuse to pick them up. One only has to read the paper to see that taxi drivers are often victims of violent crime. We need our taxis to be identifiable and to carry relevant information for customers and for security, but it seems we cannot allow them to be safe in their jobs and in their private life. There are also issues with insurance because of these decals and taxi drivers are finding it incredibly difficult to find information on the regulations affecting them from the NTA or the advisory committee. They do not know whom to ask and they get very little response when they do ask questions. Drivers need more supports to access grants needed to increase wheelchair accessible vehicles and to stay within regulations. One driver with whom I am dealing was awarded a wheelchair access grant but was unable to take it up until he had raised the money he needed. When he did raise the money he could not find out if the grant was still available to him. There is a major communication problem and it is causing serious morale problems with drivers, who are feeling increasing frustration. This is seen in the lack of knowledge among drivers about what can be done with a licence when a driver is deceased and a family member might want to keep it on.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	341	The regulation of the small public service vehicle sector is a matter for the National Transport Authority, NTA, pursuant to the Taxi Regulation Act 2013. This includes responsibility for signage. As such I have no function in this matter. I can however set out some background and some information in relation to the operation of the scheme which has been provided to me by the NTA. The requirement for taxi branding arises from the relevant recommendation of the taxi regulation review report published by this Government in January 2012. The taxi regulation review group which prepared this report included representatives of the taxi industry as well as representatives of the hospitality industry, consumer interests and disability groups. Action 31 of that report sets out the recommendation to "introduce distinctive branding of taxis (and wheelchair accessible taxis)". It further sets out that this "would take the form of semi-permanent decals applied to the vehicle body, potentially to the doors on either side of the vehicle." The report identified issues with the current reliance on the roof sign as the primary means of taxi identification and stated that "given the varied fleet, a degree of uniform branding would serve to better identify the licensed vehicle to the consumer, while ensuring that the professional operator make the same level of investment and commitment to the industry." Branding is an issue which was given extensive consideration before its adoption by the review group and subsequent endorsement by Government. A prescribed livery, often including prescribed vehicle types or permanent roof signage, is a common feature of taxis internationally. Regulations were introduced by the National Transport Authority which required that, from 1 January 2013, taxis must have the prescribed vinyl self-adhesive external branding affixed to the front doors of the vehicles. The current statutory instrument containing this requirement is SI33 of 2015, the Taxi Regulation (Small Public Service Vehicle) Regulations 2015. While I do recognise that taxis are privately owned, they are being licensed to provide a public service and a condition of operating as a public service taxi vehicle is that the vehicle is branded in accordance with legislation now in place. There have been a very small number of complaints that the imposition of a branding requirement renders a vehicle identifiable as a taxi at all times. It is acknowledged, by me and the NTA, that the imposition of a decal on the side of the vehicle does render it more visible as a taxi. However, it is still the case that, even with the roof sign removed, the vehicle is always identifiable as a taxi through the prescribed tamper-proof discs that are affixed to the front and rear windscreens at licensing stage. One of the additional benefits of the new taxi signage is that it is more difficult for vehicles to operate illegally as taxis. As the door signage is semi-permanent, the vehicle is still identifiable as a purported taxi even when the roof sign is removed, which was not the case previously.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	The Minister keeps kicking to touch to the NTA and saying that it lays the rules but it was pointed out to the review group that this would cause problems. I do not see why there is a problem in allowing people to have decals that can be taken away and put aside instead of permanently having them on the vehicle. A big issue is burglary and theft from vehicles and taxis are a major target. In many cases, taxi drivers work at night so if taxis with signage are parked outside houses, people know their owners are not there. Another example is where a driver travelling across the Border is pulled over by the PSNI which tell him that it is not wise to drive the car in certain areas. There are health and safety and other issues involved as well as the right of a person to drive their own car. When drivers pull up at traffic lights or elsewhere, people try to open the car doors when they see the decals. The sign on the roof is gone. What is the problem with going back to that? I do not see a major problem. We have dug in our heels. Hackneys and limousines do not have do it. Why should taxis have to do it? I am asking the Minister to talk to the NTA. There is also an issue with insurance companies which say that they will not provide private, social or domestic insurance because of the decals. We have a problem which we never had previously. It means that, in many cases, a person or their family needs a second car. It is an outrageous expense. We brought in rules like the nine-year rule, in which I could never see any sense. Cars went through their NCT tests. In the US and other places, some cars are 20 and 30 years old. Some of the rules introduced never made sense. Anyone who is entering the industry must have a car that is between one and four years old. That is a significant expense and excludes many people in working class areas who cannot afford the expense.

He made the assertion a moment ago that the taxi advisory committee is not playing a role in relaying information and consulting with the industry. I invite him to tell that to the unions who are represented on the committee. They will find it very interesting that the Deputy has made that assertion in the Dáil. We have a taxi advisory committee that contains the very bodies and unions that are elected to represent taxi drivers. It is a very large body and its breadth is designed to facilitate organisations to pass feedback to the NTA. If the Deputy feels this is inadequate or if he has an issue with it, I would invite him to talk to the unions on that body who are engaging with the NTA on this and other matters. In respect of the point the Deputy made about the impact of this signage on vehicles, I accept that it makes clear that vehicles are being used exclusively, or for the most part, as taxis. The very reason this is happening is in response to concerns the taxi industry had about illegal use, the quality of cars and difficulties it was facing in respect of the reputation and the growth of its industry. This regulation is in place to give the taxi industry the regulatory framework and support it needs to grow safely. If it was not in place, Deputy Ellis would come into the House to criticise me for it not being there.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	I thank the Minister of State for taking this Topical Issue today. On 16 April, we enacted a very welcome amendment to the Valuation Act which gave partial relief or exemption from commercial rates to all sports clubs which had some commercial activity, be it a small bar or renting out some of their AstroTurfs. We did that because we recognised it was unfair to rate the entire club, which is a voluntary organisation and which is the backbone of probably all our communities, on the basis of it having a small bar or renting out its AstroTurf. All politics is local so I wish to talk about my local GAA club which, historically, has had a commercial rates bill that is astronomical. It is off the wall and the club has not been able to afford it for the past number of years because the entire complex was rated. Our local council has taken four trustees of the club, who are very elderly men and who are only active in the club in a very recreational way these days, to court. They now have a judgment against them for this very large commercial rates bill and the council is pursuing them. The reason I raise this with the Minister of State is because he directly manages, controls and directs our councils. I am asking him to intervene in this particular action and ask the council to look retrospectively at the commercial rates owed and, in the spirit in which the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill was passed on 16 April, to possibly recalculate the historic commercial rates and come to an amenable agreement so that four elderly men in Ratoath do not go to bed at night worrying about whether the courts will come after them for their houses. The GAA club in Ratoath wants to pay what is owed but it only wants to pay what is fair and what it can afford. Will the Minister of State intervene through his Department with local authorities, including Meath County Council, to find an amicable, fair and amenable outcome?
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	In the past months, two very well-known GAA clubs in north County Louth have received rates demands for 2015, one in excess of €16,000 and another in excess of €15,000. Both clubs are in the north of the county and cater for over 1,000 children ranging in ages from six right up to 18 and also include adult members and players. They are voluntary, not-for-profit organisations and rely on the goodwill of the community to stay alive. Each year, the cost of running the clubs is increasing and they rely heavily on fund-raising efforts to remain open for the members and the community. I have met representatives from both clubs and other sporting organisations in County Louth and it is clear that the additional expense of the rates bill will have a very detrimental effect on the clubs. They face very stiff competition in their fund-raising efforts from other very worthwhile organisations. I have spoken to representatives from Louth County Council who have explained that from their point of view, there is no provision in law for the waiving of rates and have told me that "rates apply to all commercial outlets which include bars". The law, as it stands, states that sports club facilities are normally exempt from rates but where the club has a bar, all of its premises are valued for rates, including buildings which are purely for sporting purposes. I welcome the fact that the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill has completed its passage through the both Houses of the Oireachtas in the past week and will allow commercial and community areas within these clubs to be separated for rates purposes. Will the Minister of State and his officials actively engage with Louth County Council and the Valuation Office in respect of the commercial rates bill already issued to both clubs with a view to re-evaluating the outstanding bills on the new rateable basis?
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. I understand and appreciate the concerns they have expressed but I must clarify some aspects of the issue for them. As they are aware, local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001. The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters. The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I am aware there has in the past been discussion at a local level regarding aspects of the rateability of some sports clubs and child care providers. The Deputies are correct in saying that this has been a matter of debate in this House in recent times.In this regard, as stated by the Deputies, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform included in the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 an amendment to provide for changes to the valuation of sports clubs and child care providers. This Bill was passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas on 16 April this year and now needs to be signed by the President.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has ministerial responsibility for this Bill. The levying and collection of rates are matters for individual local authorities. In accordance with section 29 of the Local Government Act 1946, as amended, local authorities are obliged to make one rate for the whole financial year. This must be levied upon those liable for rates according to the valuation of each premises contained in the latest valuation list transmitted by the Commissioner of Valuation at the time of the adoption of the budget by the council. The annual budget is adopted before the start of each financial year. Rates bills issued to ratepayers in the current year are not subject to amendment by any alteration of valuations within that year. Contingent on the enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 in due course, the valuations of affected sports clubs and child care providers will require the Commissioner of Valuation to amend the valuation lists to which rates are applied for the future. I understand that the Commissioner will commence this process upon the enactment of the Bill. In respect of rates that have been levied on these businesses for the current and previous years, these remain a liability for the business under ratings legislation and it is a matter for the local authority to manage the collection of any outstanding debt. As the Deputies will be aware, the local authority is the rating authority and each authority is responsible for the collection of rates in their jurisdiction. The Minister and the departmental officials cannot, therefore, become directly involved in specific rates collection issues.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	347	Everything the Minister of State said is true, including that the statutory obligation to collect levies on property used for commercial purposes is the council's. Why then is the council still seeking to collect rates in respect of the changing rooms, upstairs playing hall and gym of the sports club in my area, none of which have a commercial aspect? They are run on a voluntary basis and funded by way of fund-raising events in the village. I appreciate all of the palaver with regard to the legalities around this issue, but I take this opportunity to inform the Minister of State that the day the sheriff arrives to remove items from the four elderly men who are trustees of my local club, I will be standing in front of them to prevent property from being taken away. There is no goodwill in this regard. The Department needs to look at this from the point of view the many organisations that are the backbone of our communities and are volunteering their time, services and effort to the provision of sports and recreational activities and the fund-raising events required in this regard. These people are being told, leaving aside the services they have provided for the past year, that they will continue to be pursued for commercial rates, which, as has already been acknowledged through the changes made to the legislation, were wrong.  I call on the Minister to intervene in this matter with the local authorities involved and ask that in the spirit of goodwill they renegotiate the outstanding rates on the new commercial rates basis.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	I thank the Minister of State for his response. I urge him to bear in mind that, as in the case of many other GAA clubs in this country, both of these clubs are run on a voluntary basis. It is vital that a suitable arrangement is arrived at by all the parties involved. I am a lifelong member of the GAA and I understand fully the commitment and effort required of thousands of GAA members across the country. In the majority of cases, the commercial profit derived from club bars is very small. These bars are generally only open once a week and in many cases are losing money. The clubs appreciate that they must pay rates, but they cannot afford the current very high rates.  I again urge the Minister of State and officials of his Department to work closely with Louth County Council and the Valuation Office to ensure a satisfactory solution to this issue.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	I understand the Deputies' concerns in regard to this particular issue. I am the chairperson of my local GAA club, and as such, I do understand their concerns. As stated, the law has been changed to address their concerns going forward. The Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 contains provisions to alter the basis of valuations of certain sports clubs and child care providers into the future. I welcome the granting of a specific exemption to community sports facilities, as it resolves this long-standing anomaly, and the extension of the exemption to not-for-profit child care providers, as this will ensure consistency of approach with regard to the child care sector, while respecting the principle that those who operate with the intention of making a profit remain rateable. It is important to make that point. Nevertheless, in accordance with current rating law, these exemptions can only be reflected in ratepayers' bills from 2016 at the earliest. In terms of outstanding rates liabilities owed by any businesses that may become exempt or partially exempt in the future, management of the collection of rates due is a matter solely for the local authority as the statutory body. I would expect, however, that given the changes in the law, local authorities would proactively engage with stakeholders affected to try to resolve any outstanding matters in keeping with the principle of the laws now being developed.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, for coming to the House to deal with this issue, which relates to two very sad cases that occurred around the same time. It involves the death of two people, one after a very lengthy illness, following which the household was left with various financial and other difficulties. However, I do not propose to go into those details in this public arena. The second case involves the death of a young child in equally tragic circumstances. In this case, the parents, who had been employed up to a year ago, did not have the resources to meet the cost of the child's funeral. Previously, such people would have been entitled to a bereavement grant. The bereavement grant has been replaced by the exceptional needs payment, which has the capacity to address individual household cases in terms of assistance required. In the first case, a payment was made but it was insufficient to meet the cost of the funeral expenses. As we all know, funeral expenses are considerable, and hugely so for families in financial difficulty, particularly following a period of long illness prior to death. In both cases a payment was made, and in both cases it was insufficient. I discussed these cases on a number of occasions with a very helpful person in the Department, following which further payments were made, but, again, these were far short of what was required in terms of addressing the issue. In an effort to have this issue addressed, I have raised it by way of parliamentary question on a number of occasions. Sadly, it has not been addressed. To my mind, it reflects poorly on the institutions of this State that we are not in a position to respond in the way that we should. I am not suggesting that everybody should get full payment of their funeral costs. The cases I am highlighting involved particularly extenuating circumstances, which were clear to everybody. Even a cursory examination of the means of the households in question would lead to the conclusion that close to the maximum payment would be necessary. However, this did not happen. The neighbours then had to rally round and organise events to help out. Good neighbours are greatly appreciated and this type of activity should be always encouraged. Those involved did a great job. However, I would not like to see this happen again.  I am asking today that the two cases I have highlighted be reviewed with a view to ensuring some semblance of parity with the funeral costs involved and that in future such cases only one visit would be required to allow assessment for payment, thereby reducing the cost to the State in terms of administration.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	A bereavement at any stage is always very difficult for families.I sympathise with the two cases Deputy Durkan has brought to my attention. It would be worthwhile to outline the policy position. The administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was transferred to the Department of Social Protection on 1 October 2011. The Department of Social Protection's assistant principal officers and higher executive officers administer the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. The objectives of the scheme are to provide a standard minimum income, in an immediate and flexible manner, to those whose means are insufficient to meet their basic needs. The scheme also provides income support in the form of a weekly or monthly supplement to those with specific needs that cannot be met from their regular weekly income. In addition, the scheme can assist, by way of a single payment, individuals who have one-off exceptional or urgent needs that cannot be met from their regular weekly income. In the context of the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, governance in the community welfare service involves implementing the highest standards in the process of decision-making and the process by which those decisions are implemented. In this regard, this means strict adherence to the Department's legislative policies and guidelines. Section 201 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 provides the legal basis for exceptional needs payments. The Government has provided €29 million for the exceptional needs payment scheme in 2015. The purpose of the scheme is to assist the recipient with one-off expenditure, which is exceptional and unforeseen and which, given the circumstances of the case, they could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their normal weekly income. Exceptional needs payments are not intended to cater for expenses that are of a predictable and recurring nature, such as fuel or clothing, which should be budgeted for out of regular weekly income. In making a determination on an exceptional needs payment application, the community welfare officer considers the nature and extent of the need in deciding the appropriate nature and level of assistance. In performing this function, the Department's officer must take into account the available guidelines issued by regional and local management. A claim for assistance with funeral expenses under the social welfare allowance scheme is treated as a claim for an exceptional needs payment. In 2014, the Department supported approximately 3,000 applicants with financial assistance towards the costs of funeral expenses, at a provisional cost of some €4.6 million. Entitlement to an exceptional needs payment for assistance towards funeral expenses is discretionary. The application is means tested and the primary consideration in determining that a payment is warranted is that there is an inability to pay the costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship. In determining eligibility for an exceptional needs payment towards the cost of funeral expenses, the community welfare officer must establish that the person applying for the payment has difficulty in meeting the funeral costs without causing hardship while also considering the ability of other members of the family to meet, or contribute to, the cost involved. In performing this function, the community welfare officer must take into account the available guidelines on funeral expenses. There were 189 exceptional needs payments awarded to assist with funeral expenses by the Department in Kildare from January 2014 to February 2015. The maximum payment made was €2,500 and the minimum payment made was €100. In total, €314,090 was paid, representing an average payment of €1,661. In the case of the first person concerned, a payment of €1,500 was awarded initially by the community welfare officer towards the cost of the funeral expenses. This was increased to €2,500 following a review by the review officer at the request of the person concerned. In the case of the second person concerned, a payment of €2,000 was awarded by the community welfare officer towards the cost of the funeral expenses. This was increased to €3,000 following a review by the review officer at the request of the person concerned. In any circumstances where an applicant is unhappy with the outcome of an application for an exceptional needs payment, the applicant may have the original decision reviewed by a supplementary welfare allowance review officer. I am satisfied that the procedures and guidelines relating to the provision of assistance towards funeral costs through the exceptional needs payments scheme were adhered to in respect of these two cases.

In the first case, the unfortunate situation was that a young person had to become the statutory carer for the remaining siblings in the family and, in fact, had to become their guardian and take on guardianship responsibilities. In those circumstances, there is no more pressing case that I can think of where the maximum payment applicable should be paid, and it was not done. Even after two attempts, it still was not done. I ask the Minister of State to have a look at the case because, having been in a previous incarnation an incumbent in exactly the same position in which he is now, I can assure him strange things happen when one looks closely at the smaller print. The second case, where all the children in the household were very young, involved very difficult circumstances. They also had nowhere to turn to except the statutory authorities that can be relied on in these circumstances. It goes without saying that where a child dies, as the Minister of State rightly said, it is particularly tragic for any family, but, also following two visits, the payment did not come near what was required to make an indent of some consequence on the cost of the funeral expenses. I ask that the Minister of State have a look at both of those cases. I guarantee that he will find adequate support for what I have said.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	355	Deputy Durkan knows me well. Of course I will look into the issue. In the case of the first person concerned, a payment totalling €2,500 has now been made towards the funeral bill of €5,505. In the case of the second person concerned, a payment totalling €3,000 towards the funeral bill of €6,845 has now been made by the Department. Considering the pressure families come under at a difficult time, those are quite considerable sums. The cost of funerals is something that has concerned me for quite a long period and Deputies Eamonn Maloney and Robert Dowds have raised it consistently in the House. My concern is that people are in delicate circumstances when a close family member passes away. For a long time, I have been particularly concerned about the cost of funerals. When a person loses a loved one, a funeral is not something for which he or she would shop around. It is difficult, and often families have relationships with particular undertakers, but there is an onus, possibly on the State, to ensure that the cost of funerals is competitive, people are not overcharged and there is not profiteering. I am not suggesting that this happened in these cases, but both Deputy Durkan and I know many people who have come back to us stating that if they had known beforehand the cost of the funeral they might have gone elsewhere. There is possibly something we can do in that regard. With regard to the two cases Deputy Durkan raised, for which he has already provided the contact details and arrangements, I will have officials in my Department look at them again.

Indeed, I acknowledge that he has a good record of attendance to deal with Topical Issues. There has been some confusion about this matter. I had agreed earlier that we might defer the matter until Tuesday but, apparently, decisions were made elsewhere on the matter. However, I am deeply grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic relating to pancreas transplants. It was reported last week that the former director of the national pancreas transplant programme has accused Beaumont Hospital of abandoning gravely ill patients on the waiting list. Mr. David Hickey was quoted as saying that the hospital and the HSE were taking an "unethical and callous" approach to patients on the waiting list by seeking to wind up the programme without telling them.He said, "I hate to see a pancreas programme that has been run well with minimal resources, with patients urgently needing transplants, being squashed because no one gives a damn." Finally, he said that the HSE could find itself facing charges of corporate manslaughter if it failed to provide appropriate levels of care for seriously ill patients. These are extremely serious charges coming from a surgeon who has had an illustrious career. It would appear that no pancreas transplants have been carried out in Ireland since Mr. Hickey retired last December. Mr. Hickey, who has carried out over 1,500 kidney and pancreas transplants, said he offered to stay on for two years but this was rejected by the hospital. He maintains - it is difficult to disagree - that it is unconscionable that no plan has been made for seriously ill patients four months after his retirement. His retirement date was known for 30 years, but no plans were put in place for that. It is fair to say that this is a rather bad situation, to put it at its mildest. What does the Minister think? When is it going to be rectified? I appreciate that by the standards of some waiting lists, eight people waiting is not a high number. That was the figure mentioned, although I believe Mr. Hickey has referred to 18 people. Either way, it is not a vast number, but I suspect four months without activity is not a situation the Minister would stand over. Situating a national transplant programme in a regional hospital was a mistake, Mr. Hickey said. He claimed the hospital was run by people with clipboards who cared only about budgets. I understand that from next month, pancreas transplants are to be carried out at St. Vincent's University Hospital. Moreover, under new arrangements for combined kidney and pancreas transplants, consultants from Beaumont will carry out kidney transplants. However, it is not clear who will carry out the pancreas transplants. Mr. Hickey was trenchant on this matter as well, saying that those in Beaumont had "no idea what they're talking about" in respect of the proposed transfer of services to St. Vincent's. He continued:You can’t just flick a switch and call it a transplant centre. Who is going to do the work? Given the critical nature of this particular issue, it is appropriate that we raise it in the House and provide the Minister with an opportunity to address these rather trenchant criticisms. I imagine it is our universal desire to see the problems rectified as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to hearing how the Minister proposes to do just that.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-04-23 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	358	I thank Deputy Ó Fearghaíl for raising this issue and for giving me the opportunity to address the matter in the House. The national kidney and pancreas transplant programme is currently provided at Beaumont Hospital. In 2014 Beaumont carried out 192 kidney transplants, including 152 from deceased donors and 40 from living donors, as well as six pancreas transplants. The transplant programme at Beaumont Hospital is provided through the surgical specialty of urology. As an aside, this is the first time I have ever heard Beaumont described as a regional hospital. It is recognised as the national centre for neurosurgery and kidney disease as well as many other things. I am surprised to hear someone who worked in Beaumont for so long downgrading the hospital to a regional hospital. It is not; it is a national centre in several specialties. When fully staffed, the urology department in Beaumont has 11 full-time posts. In whole-time equivalent terms, 8.5 of the consultant urologist transplant posts are based in Beaumont, with the remaining 2.5 whole-time equivalent urologist posts based at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown. At the end of 2014, two consultant transplant surgeons left the renal and pancreas transplant programme at Beaumont, one on retirement and the second on leave of absence for professional development purposes. Currently, there are three transplant vacancies, which equates to 1.5 in whole-time equivalent posts among the 11 posts - that is, three consultants who would work half time on transplants and half time on urology. Giving the limited number of surgeons who specialise in transplantation, the filling of vacancies poses a challenge at any time. While Beaumont Hospital is making every effort to recruit suitable people to fill these vacancies, the hospital is also collaborating with St. Vincent's University Hospital on a combined approach to kidney and pancreas transplants. It is now proposed that pancreas transplants, of which six were performed in 2014, will commence in St. Vincent's later this year. While the transfer of this work has been agreed in principle, it will take some time to make the detailed arrangements to facilitate the commencement of pancreas transplants. Management and clinical staff at the hospital are committed to ensuring that an optimal service is put in place which will benefit all those in need pancreas transplants. Given that St. Vincent's is already established as the national liver transplant centre and the designated centre for pancreas cancer services, this initiative makes sense and will enable two transplant centres to share resources and support and promote improvements in overall transplant services. There are nine people on the waiting list for pancreas transplants, eight of whom require simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplants. Pancreas transplantation as a stand-alone procedure is relatively uncommon. The arrangements being put in place for simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplants will involve transplant surgeons from St. Vincent's University Hospital and Beaumont working together on the St. Vincent's campus. In addition to working with St. Vincent's on a combined approach to kidney and pancreas transplants, Beaumont is also co-operating on the development of intra-abdominal organ retrieval service that will facilitate a more effective and cohesive overall procurement and transplant service. I am confident that the measures being put in place will enhance our organ transplant service in future. Six new organ donation nurse managers will be appointed shortly, one to each of the six new hospital groups. This will facilitate the development of the transplant programme over the coming years. Officials from the HSE and my Department are working with senior management and the transparent surgeons at Beaumont and St. Vincent's on the development of transplant services. All parties are committed to ensuring that the transplant programme will be developed to the further benefit of patients.

It makes sense that there would be a certain level of collaboration between Beaumont and St. Vincent's. However, I do not understand why we have had this hiatus. It has been known for 30 years that this man, the lead surgeon, would retire. Why were plans not put in place in advance of his retirement in order that there could be a seamless transition from the old to the new system? I was a member of the old Eastern Health Board. I admit that during its existence there were significant problems with recruitment and personnel management. To this day there seems to be major problems within the HSE in the area of services and recruiting vital personnel. As I understand it, a pancreas transplant is one of the most complex organ transplants that can be undertaken. The survival rate after five years is of the order of 74%, with a 51% survival rate after 15 years. I recently read that providing a transplant to one person effectively saves the HSE €700,000 over a 15-year period by comparison with the cost of providing that person with dialysis. This needs to be tackled urgently. People's lives are affected. Moreover, the budget of the health service is being adversely affected. The problem is almost universal within the HSE. I am referring to its inability to effectively manage personnel, forecast where vacancies are going to arise and show initiative and do what those in the private sector would do. It would be unimaginable in any private operation that an impending vacancy would not be filled in such a way as has occurred in this case.

Dialysis is for kidney treatment and not pancreas problems. The renal unit seems to be working relatively well in Beaumont. Certainly, it has not been the case that any kidneys that could have been transplanted in Ireland were exported or anything like that. I am not involved in recruitment to individual posts in Beaumont or any other hospital, but I understand the hospital had difficulty filling the post in question. It was advertised and the hospital was unable to get someone. That is an ongoing problem in our health service. What would happen in the private sector is that an organisation would go out and head-hunt someone and pay the person whatever had to be paid, but that is not how the public service works. We do not give market rates to individual people. For various reasons, the public service is different from the private sector in that regard, for better and for worse. Anyway, the important thing now is that the new arrangements are being put in place. It is anticipated that the arrangements will be fully in place within the next couple of weeks.
