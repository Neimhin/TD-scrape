#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	2	In March 2002, Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee group presented their report, The Challenge of a Workplace, to my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith. The contents and recommendations of the Doyle report were accepted in full.Action to implement the recommendations of the report has been a priority since that time. The follow-up action was driven by an independent monitoring group established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of recommendations arising from the report. This group met regularly to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations.The independent monitoring group's progress report, Response to the Challenge of a Workplace, was launched by my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, on Friday, 24 September 2004. This describes the progress achieved to date since the publication of the original Doyle report in 2002.The monitoring group has overseen the conduct of a major educational awareness programme throughout the Defence Forces. Considerable progress has been made in the past two years. Firm guiding principles had already been set out in the Defence Forces dignity in the workplace charter.A new administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships was introduced in March 2003 and a user's guide was distributed to every member of the Defence Forces. The new instruction describes the six key relevant domains of interpersonal relationship within the Defence Forces. It sets out contemporary best practice for policy and procedures in dealing with negative workplace behaviours. It lists the full set of formal and informal complaint procedures that may be utilised by any party wishing to institute a complaint. Some 200 trained designated contact persons are being put in place throughout the organisation to facilitate the operation of these procedures.An independent and external confidential free telephone helpline and counselling service has been set up by expert consultants from Northern Ireland staff care services. Each serving member of the Permanent Defence Force was informed of this service. A pilot project to record the experiences and views of outgoing members of the Defence Forces was conducted by the Dublin Institute of Technology research centre.The particular challenges of the military training environment were identified in the Doyle report. This area has been given particular attention in the past two years, especially the key pivotal roles of non-commissioned officers in leadership and training within brigade formations. The monitoring group has made a series of important recommendations concerning the ranking, selection, training and reward systems for officer and NCO instructors in the cadet school. An immediate change in the training regime for cadets will have a vital demonstration effect.Additional informationIt has been decided therefore that the process of introducing these changes will begin with the 2004 cadet intake. Some of the changes will take longer to implement and will be addressed through the conciliation and arbitration process or the overall review of Defence Forces organisation.The equality steering group was established in autumn 2003 and has conducted its own independent study under a Labour Court chairperson of Defence Forces regulations and administrative instructions, policy and procedures. Its comprehensive audit examined policy and procedures in the light of existing civil statutory requirements such as employment equality and equal status and best civil employment practice.The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill completed all Stages in the Dáil in July and has now been introduced to the Seanad. The Bill should pass all Stages before the end of October. The provision of a statutory ombudsman for the Defence Forces will provide a further significant impetus in support of the major transformation in culture and practice which has been initiated and which is now well under way.The Defence Forces are in the process of developing an active and strategic human resource management model of personnel management, development and leadership under the new integrated personnel management system. This is an important step that will facilitate and hasten the achievement and consolidation of our shared objectives. The tangible end result will be a modern and contemporary Defence Forces that can serve as an international role model.Every member of the Defence Forces has a right to be treated with respect and dignity and to work within the Defence Forces free from harassment, sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination. The monitoring group has explicitly recommended that a further independent review and audit of progress within the Defence Forces be carried out no later than 2007 and that the results should be made public.

I hope he has a happy and successful sojourn in that position. I am sure he will understand if I express the hope that it will not be too long and that he may soon be looking at it from this side of the House.I was delighted the Minister's first official function was last week's PDFORRA conference in Letterkenny, at which I met him briefly. I am sure the Minister is aware of the concerns within PDFORRA at the continuing incidence of bullying and harassment within the Defence Forces. In the context of the response a fortnight ago to the original report which was published two years ago, does the Minister agree there is an ongoing problem when a quarter of all military personnel have experienced bullying and harassment, including almost 70% of the female members of the Defence Forces?I do not know whether the Minister has yet familiarised himself with the original report, The Challenge of a Workplace, which itemises a litany of serious infringements of individual rights, including some very serious incidents of rape and attempted rape which went unreported; as well as demands for sexual favours, offensive telephone calls, e-mails and text messages; breaking into women's bedrooms, walking into women's shower areas and the display of pornographic material. I do not suggest this has not happened in other areas——

#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	5	However, at least the Defence Forces are facing up to this. Does the Minister agree that if this is allowed to continue it will undermine the team spirit which is so necessary for discipline within the Defence Forces? Will he also indicate if the proposed ombudsman for the Defence Forces will be given a meaningful role in counteracting this activity within the services? Will he further outline the responsibilities of the 200 marshals who were announced in recent weeks to deal with this ongoing problem?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I thank Deputy McGinley for his kind words of congratulations. As to how short or long a time I will be in the Cabinet, I cannot say. However, it is great to have reached this point and, as the former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Denis Healy, said, "it is always better to be a has-been than a never-was".I agree with Deputy McGinley that the problem to which he referred is ongoing. A number of improvements have been made since the original administrative instruction in 2002 but the problem continues to dog the Defence Forces. While a lot has been done, to paraphrase a certain election manifesto, a lot more needs to be done. A number of initiatives are in place which will improve the situation considerably.The direct contact persons are the subject of a question from Deputy Sherlock and I will give details of their specific responsibilities in my reply to him. We will take Committee Stage of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002 in the Seanad tomorrow. The ombudsman will have a very meaningful role. He or she will replace the Minister for Defence, or the CIO as is the case at present, as the final court of appeal. Individual members of PDFORRA whom I met last week brought to my attention the fear experienced by some members of enlisted personnel about making a complaint. They are worried about whether such a complaint would be held against them and used to punish them at some time in the future. I am anxious to get around that issue. The 200 designated contact persons will have a vital role to play in that regard. In addition, any attempt to punish or penalise any enlisted person who makes a complaint will be an offence which will be subject to military discipline.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	7	As the House will be aware, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 435 personnel, is serving with the United Nations Mission in Liberia, or UNMIL, since December 2003. Defence Forces personnel serving with the mission are entitled to 21 days annual leave for the duration of their tour of duty, which is six months.I am advised that the average cost of a return commercial scheduled flight ticket Dublin to Monrovia is €1,200. Members of the Irish contingent in Liberia have the opportunity to avail of a subsidised leave flight to Ireland during their tour of duty in Liberia. Arrangements were made by my predecessor to allow personnel serving in Liberia to avail of aircraft chartered for the deployment, consignment and/or repatriation of personnel, stores and equipment to and from the mission area. Access to these flights is made available, space permitting, to personnel who are: availing of leave; travelling to or from the mission area on duty; or being repatriated from the mission area.In the case of personnel who are availing of the flights for leave purposes, a contribution of €500 is provided by each individual and a mechanism to have the sum deducted at source from the individual's overseas allowance has been agreed with the Department's financial accounts section. There has been a very high uptake of the facility by members of the 90th and 91st infantry battalions to date. Of the 90th infantry battalion, 96.5% of its members availed of the facility. The present battalion, that is the 91st infantry battalion, shows a similar take up. There are no plans at present to alter the current arrangements. However, the matter will be kept under review.I am advised that all Irish personnel are issued with mosquito nets as well as two types of mosquito repellent, one for application to the mosquito net and the other for normal skin application.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I join my colleague in congratulating the Minister. It is rather extraordinary that Irish soldiers in Liberia who have to travel home are being charged €500 for the trip. That is unfair, as is the suggestion that troops should buy their own mosquito nets and repellent. How can that be justified? If our soldiers are serving abroad and they are charged to come home on holiday, why are they also charged to buy their own mosquito nets and repellents? They are our soldiers serving abroad. I would like to hear the Minister justify that. He answered part of the next part of my question. What provisions are in place for medical cover and care for troops? Is he satisfied that this is adequate? Is he satisfied with the level of accommodation available for troops?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	9	It is quite generous. My predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith, made an arrangement that a commercial flight costing €1,200 would be given to people serving in Liberia for €500. That €500 would be deducted from their overseas allowance, which accumulates over the six month period they are there. That is a generous arrangement. When I was in Letterkenny last week, I took the opportunity to speak on an individual basis to various members of PDFORRA about the gripes they had. Not one person mentioned this as a difficulty. I have spoken to the chief of staff about the matter. Army personnel tell me that if someone wants to avail of this arrangement and wants to do it in a less painful manner, such as having the money deducted over a longer time, then the army is disposed to look favourably at arrangements such as this.With regard to the second part of the question, I do not have to justify a situation whereby people are asked to purchase their own mosquito nets. The simple fact is that they are not asked to do so. I am afraid Deputy Sherlock, whom I thank for his kind words, is misinformed in that regard. The information available to me is that those things are supplied to the troops.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I am well informed that our troops are not supplied with such equipment. That can be verified if the Minister wants to check the position. Will he indicate how long contingents spend in Liberia? How often do personnel serving there have the opportunity to return home, and what procedures are in place to allow them to keep in touch with their families?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I must contradict the Deputy. My information is that the troops are supplied with the relevant protective equipment, mosquito nets etc. They are allowed 21 days' leave during their six-month service period. They can avail of this generous charter flight offer, space permitting. Some 96% of the original brigade availed of it. It appears the uptake among the troops currently serving there will be similar. Nobody has made complaints to me about this matter. If people consider the cost involved could be deducted in another way that would be less painful for the person who has to pay for the flight, we would be well disposed to examining that.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Ireland's commitment to the headline goal consists of an offer of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces from within our existing commitment of 850 personnel to the United Nations Standby Arrangements System, UNSAS. I stress that the commitment to the headline goal should not be interpreted as an additional commitment of the Defence Forces to overseas operations. Any new commitments to the 2010 headline goal will be from within these arrangements. I have no plans to change the arrangements for Ireland's contribution to this commitment or the headline goal.Ireland's commitment to international peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management operations represents some 10% of our Army and is not an inconsiderable undertaking by any standard. It is worth noting that 740 members of the Defence Forces are deployed overseas making significant contributions to Kosovo and the United Nations Mission in Liberia. I am delighted the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Kofi Annan, will this week meet members of the Defence Forces who have contributed to our proud record of participation on peacekeeping operations overseas.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I preface my question by clearly stating that Sinn Féin believes the UN should and must develop urgently the capacity for genocide prevention. There cannot be a higher priority for the international community to address as a whole.The Minister referred to the UN Secretary General. On Thursday, the Secretary General will pitch Irish involvement in the new EU rapid deployment battle groups and inform us that he welcomes the outsourcing of UN peacekeeping operations to the EU. The justification for this from his point of view is the urgent need to develop genocide prevention capacity. Does the Minister accept it is no accident the UN's peacekeeping capacity is so weak and that the reason for this is that for decades it has been systematically starved of resources? The EU, which is in a position to change this, has selfishly focused on developing its own capacity and military alliance.The Brahimi report on peacekeeping operations found that this development has been a significant contribution to the UN's current difficulties. Does the Minister accept that policies such as those of the Department of Defence of failing to prioritise and adequately resource UN-led missions first and foremost is contributing to the erosion of the UN's in-house peacekeeping capacity? Does he accept that we have a responsibility to earmark Defence Forces personnel for UN-led operations to strengthen the capacity lost to regional military alliances, as is happening at present? How can he ignore the significant finding of the Brahimi report on this and that Government policy is contributing to the undermining of the UN system by threatening it with redundancy? Why is the Government, which in the past professed UN primacy as a central tenet of our foreign policy, contributing to the problem rather than seeking to find a solution?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	14	The Government has taken no decision to date on participation or non-participation in the battle group concept to which the Deputy referred. I do not accept there is a widespread conspiracy to deprive the UN of sufficient troops for peacekeeping to allow the EU to develop its capacity. It came to world attention in the early 1990s, especially in the situation in the Balkans, that people can be slaughtered, murdered, raped and attacked on European soil and at that time the European Union had no capacity to do anything about it. The nations of Europe decided collectively that they should get involved in peacekeeping and peacemaking in such circumstances, not only outside Europe but also on European soil. This development is not in competition with UN policy but has occurred in tandem with it and with UN agreement. The UN specifically requested the EU to become involved in some of the missions in which it has become involved latterly, including the mission in Macedonia and the programme in the Congo in 2003, which prevented many innocent civilians being slaughtered and gave breathing space to the UN to allow it establish a permanent force in the region.As I said in respect of the battle group concept, which is a misnomer and misleading — I will elaborate on this further in response to another question — the reality is that the developments in question are happening not only by agreement with the UN but also at its instigation. I am not aware that the Government is involved in any conspiracy to denude the UN in favour of the EU. All the missions being undertaken by the EU and some missions by NATO are being engaged in at the specific request and by sanction of the UN.

If 850 are committed to the UN, is it the case that they will not be available to the Rapid Reaction Force, and vice versa?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Yes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 76 together.The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. The Air Corps has been providing search and rescue services off the north-west coast but withdrew yesterday following a hand-over of this role to CHCI, a private operator, which currently provides the service at the country's other search and rescue bases at Dublin, Shannon and Waterford.I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, that CHCI will provide continuity of search and rescue service to the coastal, island and seafaring communities in the north west. I understand that the mission list for the Irish Coast Guard's service includes air ambulance, island relief, medevac etc.As the Deputy is aware, my Department is engaged in a tender competition for the acquisition of six new helicopters for the Air Corps. Their primary role will be that of general purpose military operations and training. Primary tasks will include training and operations with the Army, security and aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport. However, these helicopters will also be available to perform air ambulance, aid to the civil community and VIP transport tasks. Air Corps personnel will continue to train to provide a limited non-maritime search and rescue capability within the Defence Forces.The White Paper on Defence establishes the roles of the Defence Forces as including the provision of services to civil authorities as and when required. The Defence Forces have never been found wanting in this regard, particularly in times of floods, forest fires, severe weather conditions or any other emergencies faced by the community. In the event of an emergency request from the Irish Coast Guard or from any other service, the Air Corps will obviously respond to any such request in its usual efficient and supportive manner and to the best of its capability.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	18	After 43 years of being responsible for search and rescue operations, the Air Corps was relieved of that responsibility yesterday afternoon. This brings to an end a glorious chapter in the history of the Air Corps. Not only did it carry out search and rescue missions but it always responded promptly to requests from coastal communities and islands down through the years. Will the Minister give us an undertaking that the new company taking over from the Air Corps will respond in the same manner, always free of charge to the island communities? Is the Minister aware that only the week before last, a seriously ill woman on Tory Island had to depend on the Arranmore lifeboat to bring her ashore in my parish? That very sick woman then had to travel a further 40 miles to hospital. If the Air Corps or the new service had been available she would have got to hospital in a matter of minutes rather than hours.I put on record our appreciation of the Air Corps staff. The words of the well-known song, "Those magnificent men in their flying machines", could be applied aptly to them. Given what the Minister has said, I hope there will be a role for these people in future. They have accumulated much expertise and experience over the years so it would be a pity if the Air Corps was not available. When people said "Tá siad ag teacht" on Tory or other small islands, they were not referring to the lasta or the currach but to those helicopters. Their withdrawal is a body-blow to the morale of the Air Corps. When the new Minister examines the matter with an open mind, I hope he will reconsider the future role of the Air Corps in this regard because it has been doing this work for 41 years.I wish the new company well. I have absolutely nothing against private enterprise, no matter where it is located, and if it matches the service we got from the Air Corps we will be happy. After the long campaign to have Air Corps personnel based locally, I would hate to see those people being reassigned elsewhere and, thus, no longer available on the west coast.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I agree with Deputy McGinley that the Air Corps has done a magnificent job over the past 43 years. I join with him in expressing good wishes for the Air Corps, as well as recognising its service over the years. It is appropriate to salute Air Corps personnel, some of whom have made the ultimate sacrifice in performing essential rescue missions. I will refer to those later if I get an opportunity to do so.As regards the Deputy's key question, the answer is "yes". The service provided by the new company, which is already being provided in Dublin, Shannon and Waterford, will certainly not be any less than heretofore. I think it will provide an enhanced service. The Deputy will be aware that when the decision was taken to replace the Air Corps by this private company in the north west, it was preceded by an evaluation undertaken by the previous Minister, Deputy Michael Smith. Unfortunately, that evaluation concluded that we could no longer be guaranteed a full, 24-hour service from the Air Corps in this regard. We are talking about life and death and we need to have a constant, full-time, 24-hour, dedicated service, which I know this new company will provide.I take Deputy McGinley's point regarding the transition period between the new company taking over and the Air Corps leaving. I have spoken to my officials and to Air Corps personnel about this and I assure Deputy McGinley and the House generally that there will be no risk during that transitional period. During the training period for the new company, it will be tasked with rescue missions. It has helicopter bases in Shannon, Dublin and Waterford, and the Air Corps will be standing by to render necessary assistance.As regards the future, the Air Corps will still be available in non-maritime situations to provide certain rescue facilities, including an air ambulance service. That is what we have decided will be the future role for the Air Corps in these situations.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Deputy's question refers to the provision of 200 designated contact persons within the Defence Forces as an integral part of the new, revised military grievance procedures. A need was identified for the putting in place of contact persons within the Defence Forces organisation in line with recognised best practice. The aim of the designated contact persons is to provide a voluntary informal resource for personnel who may wish to discuss an incident of alleged bullying or harassment.An external civilian consultant was sourced to devise the informal complaints procedure under the new revised administrative instruction A7. She also designed and delivered an appropriate training programme for those who were selected for training as designated contact persons.Some 200 specially trained designated contact persons are being put in place throughout the organisation to facilitate the operation of the new informal complaints procedures. Some 80 are already trained and a strategic plan is in place to develop the numbers up to 200. Some 170 trained designated contact persons will be in place before Christmas. It is important to note that only personnel who have successfully undergone the necessary special training will become DCPs. This team of DCPs will be professionally supported over time by a consultative team, including the external civilian consultant previously referred to who has wide professional experience and expertise in this area.The role of the DCP is focused on confidential listening; providing a supportive environment; empowering the individual; providing information; assisting the individual and empathising without judgment. The DCP is not a mediator or negotiator as such. The DCP does not function in the role of an active counsellor, investigator or professional advice provider.The original Doyle report was published in 2002. The report found that 27% of survey respondents perceived themselves as having experienced bullying within the Defence Forces. This figure was notably higher at approximately 70% for female respondents from the lower enlisted ranks. Some 30% of respondents overall perceived themselves as having experienced harassment. The somewhat higher figure of 35% related to females, and the marginally lower figure of 27% related to males.My predecessor had secured significant progress and notable achievements over the past two years, since the publication of the Doyle report, in openly addressing and fundamentally tackling this issue. The provision of DCPs is yet another component part of that continuing strategy of active response to the findings and recommendations of the Doyle report.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	21	When will those appointed commence work? I would like a clear answer as to whether the Minister agrees that bullying is endemic within the Defence Forces. I note this is in response to a major study that indicated that more than one-quarter of the military had been bullied and 10% claimed it was continuing. Is the Minister aware that the analysis indicates females in the lower ranks are the victims of bullying while in training?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Certainly bullying appeared to be endemic in the military when the Doyle report was commissioned in 2002, which is more than two years ago. There is evidence that the situation has improved substantially since then. As I said earlier, there is still much to be done but I believe the Defence Forces ombudsman, the new training schemes, new integrated personnel management system and the designated contract persons will have a vital role to play in this regard. I agree with Deputy Sherlock that the original statistics indicated females were more likely than males to be bullied.On the first part of the Deputy's question, 80 of these 200 people are already trained and ready to start work. We hope to have 170 in place by Christmas and obviously it will not take too long to put the remaining 30 in place. These people are ready to go into action straight away.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Ireland is currently contributing approximately 740 Defence Forces personnel to 21 different missions throughout the world. The main commitments are to the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo, with 213 personnel, and to the United Nations Mission in Liberia, with 435 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the European Union. Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the OSCE, the United Nations, NATO and the EU.In Kosovo the Defence Forces are serving as part of a Finnish battalion with a Swedish-led multinational brigade. A reorganisation and downsizing of the NATO led forces in KFOR was planned and had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in March this year in Kosovo. That downsizing has now been deferred to allow the situation to settle. The withdrawal of the Irish contingent was planned as part of this downsizing and was to have been completed by October 2004. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, Ireland will continue to maintain an appropriate presence in KFOR in 2004.Ireland's other current major contribution to peacekeeping is in Liberia. Here, Ireland, together with an infantry company group from Sweden, provides the rapid reaction reserve to the UNMIL force commander. Despite the difficult start to this mission, with the tragic death of Sergeant Derek Mooney of the Army ranger wing in a road accident, the mission is proving successful. Ireland was specifically requested by the UN to participate in a substantive manner in this mission, which is a tribute to the high regard in which the UN holds the Defence Forces. I very much welcome the participation of Sweden as part of the reserve. This type of co-operationis reflective of the changing dynamics in peacekeeping.Additional informationThe range and diversity of arrangements now in place for peacekeeping allow us to work in tandem with like-minded nations to contribute in a very effective and meaningful manner to peace support operations throughout the world. Interoperability with other forces is a key factor in our involvement in PfP and in our preparations over the past few years for the EU rapid reaction force. It is rewarding to see the effects of the hard work put in by the Defence Forces over the past number of years coming to fruition in such a positive way in the peace support role. It is intended that Defence Forces involvement in UNMIL will not exceed two to three years.In the coming months, we are looking forward to the takeover by the EU of the current NATO led operation in Bosnia Herzegovina, known as SFOR. Ireland has already participated in its first EU mission, Operation Artemis, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and we currently have a number of staff deployed at SFOR headquarters. Subject to the approval of the Government and Dáil Éireann and an appropriate UN mandate, it is proposed that Ireland will contribute in a substantive manner to the EU mission, codenamed Operation Althea, taking account of available resources and ongoing developments in other peace support missions in which we are involved. Planning for participation in Operation Althea is currently ongoing.No other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time, particularly having regard to the scale of our current overseas commitments. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, situations will no doubt arise where a request will be received for some Irish participation and these will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

If so, what discussion has taken place?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Discussions have taken place with regard to the proposed takeover by the EU, as mandated by the UN, of the NATO led operation in Bosnia. I understand this will take place in December. Ireland already has 12 people working on that mission and we have agreed in principle to provide 30 and 50 personnel to the force. Some 7,000 are already participating in this operation and they will be replaced by 7,000 new personnel. This mission, known as Operation Althea, is the only current proposal for future peacekeeping operations although the situation will continue to develop.

I am referring to the requirement for Government approval, Dáil approval and UN mandate and the veto that a member of the Security Council could impose on Ireland's participation. This has happened in the past. Does the Minister consider that it could happen in the future? China imposed a veto when Ireland wished to participate in Kosovo or one of those eastern European countries.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I believe Deputy McGinley is referring to the mission whereby UN sanction was vetoed by China. In effect, members of the Security Council have a veto on such operations. It is our intention that the triple-lock arrangement will continue. Any peacekeeping operations or foreign engagements involving Irish troops will require a decision by the Government, ratification by the Dáil and sanction by the UN. While one could say that some people have a veto which might effectively prevent Irish involvement in peacekeeping missions, any movement to diminish the triple-lock would undermine the notion that the UN is superior in this regard and that Ireland only acts under its aegis. I do not envisage any change in the triple-lock arrangement. The veto is an element of the UN structure but so far as Ireland is concerned, it is the primacy of the UN which is paramount. Such operations must be approved unanimously and if the veto is exercised, that is too bad and means that Ireland cannot become involved. As far as the Government is concerned, the triple-lock arrangement will continue to operate in its current form.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	28	As I outlined in my reply to Deputy McGinley, the Air Corps has withdrawn from the provision of search and rescue in the north west with effect from yesterday. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, which has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue area has contracted with a private operator, CHCI, to provide the search and rescue service in the north west. CHCI already provides search and rescue services for the rest of the Irish search and rescue area from its bases at Cork, Waterford and Shannon.I take this opportunity, as I am sure the House would like, to salute the Air Corps for the dedication and bravery shown by its search and rescue crews over the past 40 years. The Air Corps has been involved in some of the most dangerous and daring rescues around our coast, saving more than 3,000 lives. The crews involved undertook these missions in situations that called for the utmost bravery. Many different awards both national and international have formally recognised this down through the years. In fulfilling this rewarding but dangerous task some members of the Air Corps have paid the ultimate price. It is fitting on this occasion to again pay tribute to the crew of Dauphin 248, Captain Mick Baker, Captain Dave O'Flaherty, Sergeant Paddy Mooney and Corporal Niall Byrne who were tragically killed in Waterford in July 1999 while returning from a search and rescue mission.Bearing all this in mind, it was obviously a very difficult decision my predecessor Deputy Smith had to make last December when it was decided that the Air Corps would withdraw from search and rescue. This decision was taken against what has always been the overriding concern of the Government, and the Air Corps, for the safety of mariners and of anyone who gets into difficulty where SAR can respond. The Air Corps was not in a position to provide the level of service required and so the baton has passed to CHCI, which has proven its dedication and professionalism in this area of endeavour.This change in provider will not downgrade the level of service provided to mariners or those who live in our island communities. The coast guard mission list includes air ambulance, island relief, medevac etc.While yesterday was naturally tinged with sadness at leaving SAR, this change marks the beginning of a new era for the Air Corps. Significant investment continues in the Air Corps as a whole, both in infrastructure and in assets. The new Lear jet was delivered at the start of the year and flew more than 78 missions during the Irish EU Presidency. With the delivery of the Pilatus aircraft the Air Corps is engaged in an intensive fixed wing training programme that allows for the continued training of young cadets to the highest standard. This is a very realistic response to the needs of the Air Corps at this time.Additional informationAs I have already outlined, my Department is currently engaged in a tender competition for the acquisition of six new helicopters for the Air Corps. Their primary role will be that of general purpose military operations and training. Primary tasking will include training and operations with the Army, including the ranger wing, security and aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport. However, these helicopters will also be available to perform air ambulance, aid to the civil authority, community assistance and VIP transport tasks. Air Corps personnel will continue to train to provide a limited non-maritime search and rescue capability within the Defence Forces.The very significant resources invested in the Air Corps will put it on a very sound footing to meet its commitments to the Defence Forces and to the community into the future.

Has that been resolved? Who will fund the new system and which Department will have responsibility for it?Were we in a position to help in the matter of the Canadian submarine incident?

Perhaps it existed before I came to this office. The short answer to the Deputy's question is that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will have responsibility for funding this company. It will pay the company for the search and rescue services.I have a note on the situation with regard to the Deputy's other question, but I require the Ceann Comhairle's permission to read it to the House.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	32	We have limited time for questions. There are only six minutes for the question and at least three Deputies want time on it.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The short answer is that we were in a position to help in the situation.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I add my congratulations to the Minister on his well deserved promotion.I would like to focus on the role of the Air Corps in the air ambulance. From January 2003 to September 2004 some 116 missions were carried out to the north west by the air ambulance. These missions assisted a range from non-spinal to spinal and neonatal injuries. The air ambulance has been transferred to Baldonnel. Will the Minister consider basing it in the north west so that the flight time between Sligo and Letterkenny General Hospitals and Dublin will be halved? Six highly trained members of the Air Corps reside in the north west but they must be transferred to Baldonnel. Is this decentralisation in reverse?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Ironically, the helicopter available for use by the Air Corps for search and rescue missions in the north west is the same one that will be used by the new company. The Air Corps leased the helicopter from that company, which has taken it back. The helicopter will be based at the same location and it would be an unnecessary duplication of service to base another Air Corps helicopter there. I assure the House that, far from there being a diminution of service as a result of the change-over, the search and rescue service will be immeasurably enhanced.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The Minister stated the reason the Air Corps association with search and rescue services was terminated was its inability to provide 24 hour cover. Does he agree that is slightly misleading because the Air Corps provided cover 24 hours a day, seven days a week? A temporary difficulty relating to the winch crew arose in December 2002, which could have been negotiated and settled at the time. Until that difficulty arose, 24 hour cover was provided and the reason for terminating the contract was based on a dubious premise.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I do not accept the contract was terminated based on a dubious premise. The difficulties with the winch crew resulted in a major outbreak of the Army version of "blue flu" when many people went sick simultaneously. People are entitled to do that, but the Deputy referred to a temporary industrial relations difficulty. Temporary difficulties can recur and it is impossible to guarantee they will not recur. This service is provided to deal with imminent danger to life. It is, therefore, important that a 24 hour search and rescue service is provided, and it is not as if we are plucking somebody out of the sky. We are contracting a company that has operated to the highest standards in other search and rescue areas.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.A significant achievement of the Irish Presidency in the development of the European Security and Defence Policy was the agreement of a new headline goal with a horizon of 2010, as approved by the European Council in June 2004. Reflecting the European security strategy, which was presented to the European Council in December 2003 by the Secretary General-High Representative Solana, member states have decided to commit themselves to respond to a crisis with rapid and decisive action, applying a fully coherent approach to the whole spectrum of crisis management operations. This includes humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. Member states have also recognised that interoperability, deployability and sustainability of forces must be at the core of their efforts and will be the driving factors of this 2010 goal.The 2010 headline goal also incorporated the development of the EU's rapid response capability. A key element of the headline goal is the ability of the EU to deploy force packages at high readiness, commonly known as battlegroups, in response to a crisis as a stand-alone force or as part of a larger operation enabling follow-on phases. An example of the contribution an effective battlegroup could make in restoring peace to a region suffering from conflict is the Finnish-Irish peacekeeping battalion deployed with the United Nations force in Kosovo, KFOR, which has been the subject of recent favourable comment arising from its reaction to an outbreak of hostilities in its area of operations last March.Member states have been asked to provide initial indications of commitments to such force packages, with a view to an initial operational capability in 2005 at a capability commitment conference to be held in November under the Dutch Presidency. The question of Ireland's participation in such force packages is under examination in my Department.The 2010 headline goal will have no implications for national sovereignty, which is a fundamental underlying principle to participation in the European Security and Defence Policy. Ireland will continue to approach proposed missions on a case-by-case basis and will only participate in operations authorised by the United Nations and with the approval of the Government and this House.

Even if we do not participate, Article 28 of the Treaty of the European Union refers to what are known as "common costs". What does the Minister anticipate those common costs will be for Ireland?Does the Minister agree that the battle groups as they are now constituted are the embryonic form of a European army? Will he comment on the matter? Is he concerned about the way in which battle groups will be used? He mentioned the Petersberg Tasks which include pre-emptive action, joint disarmament operations and, I quote, speak of support for third countries in combating terrorism. I would like the Minister to comment on the analysis of the International Security Information Service in Brussels that has said——

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	45	——a full scale invasion such as the one that took place in Iraq. I would like the Minister to comment on that.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I thank Deputy Gormley for his kind words of congratulation that I deeply appreciate. My understanding is that there is no obligation on Ireland to participate in this though I will double check for the Deputy. On costs, we operate on the principle that they lie where they fall. If we contribute to a particular mission, we bear the cost. In future, there could be a question of common costs that would be shared among the different participants, but we have certainly not arrived at that stage yet.I do not agree with Deputy Gormley that the battle groups constitute an embryonic European army. We are speaking here about a number of states making a contribution of personnel or equipment to these battle groups under the aegis and at the request of the United Nations. Such battle groups could be assembled and deployed quickly to prevent genocide such as we saw in Rwanda, pillage, rape and other forms of attack. That is the raison d’être of this proposal. While the United Nations regularly requests individual countries to provide forces for peacekeeping, nobody has suggested the organisation has an army. Therefore, I do not see why it is proper to say Europe has an embryonic or any other type of army.

There is a contradiction in that, which has not been fully explained to the people. By signing up to this and furthering it by agreeing to battle groups, we are lessening our commitment to the UN.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I do not agree. The issue here is the supply of personnel for peacekeeping missions whether the request is made by the United Nations directly or indirectly through the European Union. I do not see what is the difference in substance.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Will the Minister comment on the declaration at the June European Council that spoke of pre-emptive action? Does he agree that battle groups should be involved in such action?The Minister told the House that he does not believe there is justification for discussion of an embryonic European army. I put it to him that in the headline goal itself, the European Union is referred to as a global actor ready to take on the role of a global security force. That gives rise to popular suspicion that what is involved is a counterweight, as so many people put it, to the United States of America. That is what we are talking about.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I do not see European Governments involving themselves in the level of expenditure on weapons and military capability that would make them an effective counterweight to the United States of America in our lifetime.On pre-emptive action, Deputy Gormley may or may not be aware that a capability conference will take place in Brussels in November which I hope to attend on behalf of the Government. The details of how battle groups will operate, of what they will consist and of how member states hope to contribute or not will be discussed there. We are at an early stage at the moment and people should not rush to conclusions about pre-emptive action.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	53	That is what I said. I was simply quoting the Minister.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	54	One can say what one wishes, but the ultimate shape of the rapid response force will be decided by the defence Ministers of the member states of the European Union. We have decided nothing yet.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 15 and 35 together.The procurement process for the acquisition of new helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This major investment programme will involve the acquisition of six helicopters. It is proposed to purchase two light utility helicopters, primarily for Air Corps crew training purposes, and four larger utility helicopters to support the Army and for other ancillary uses such as air ambulance duties. It is also expected to agree an option to purchase a further two helicopters of the larger type. The new aircraft will replace the current fleet of Dauphin, Alouette and Gazelle helicopters.The tender competition was advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 29 May 2004 with the closing date for the receipt of tenders being Tuesday, 3 August 2004. Valid tenders were received from Eurocopter, Sikorsky and AgustaWestland and a comprehensive tender evaluation process is ongoing. A project team comprising officials from my Department and Air Corps and Army personnel is undertaking the evaluation that will, of necessity, take some time to complete. It is expected, however, that the Department will be in a position to place a contract before the end of the year. Deputies will appreciate that as the evaluation process is ongoing, I am not in a position to give any details of the costs of the helicopters.The Air Corps, primarily in the military pilot and aircrew training roles will operate the two light utility helicopters. Primary tasks for the helicopters will include pilot training, instructor training and instrument flight training. The four larger utility helicopters will be operated by the Air Corps in general purpose military operational and training roles and will not be dedicated for use by any particular element of the Defence Forces. Primary tasks for the utility helicopters will include training and operations with special forces, security and aid to the civil power, military exercises, infantry interoperability training and limited troop transport.The helicopters will have the capability of lifting some Defence Forces equipment such as artillery pieces but will not have the capability to lift heavy equipment. They will also be used to perform air ambulance, inland search and rescue, aid to the civil community and VIP transport tasks. The contract for the supply of the helicopters will be awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender applying the following award criteria which are listed in order of priority: functional characteristics, operational suitability and technical merit; maintenance, technical support and after sales service; tender prices; life cycle costs over 20 years; training packages offered; warranties offered; and delivery period.The procurement of modern light utility and utility helicopters will provide a significant boost to the Air Corps. In that regard, every effort will be made to ensure the process moves along as quickly as possible to ensure the new helicopters are available to the Air Corps at the earliest possible date.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Can the Minister guarantee the helicopters will be purchased and that events such as the debacle over the €100 million tender which occurred in 2002 will not recur? Is it not time this issue was dealt with once and for all? It would be timely if the Minister could guarantee the purchase of the helicopters and proceed with the programme.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Does the Minister accept the Department of Defence has created a mess in this area given it recommended Eurocopter in the first instance? I was struck by the use of the words "VIP transport tasks" in the Minister's reply. Will the military helicopters be used to transport Ministers around the country? Are Mercs to be replaced by helicopters?
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I understand from the Minister's initial reply that Sikorsky has tendered for the supply of the six helicopters. If memory serves me correctly, a confrontation between Sikorsky and the Government two or three years ago resulted in the original order being cancelled. Has whatever disagreement that existed at that time been satisfactorily resolved? I understood threats were made at the time to go to the High Court in an effort to have matters sorted out. Will the helicopters have a military capacity? In other words, will they be armed?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Deputy Sherlock asked an important question. I guarantee the purchase will take place. The tender process is well under way. As far as I am aware, the 2002 proposal related to the purchase of medium lift helicopters. That proposal was dropped as a result of a demand for savings across various Departments. The Department of Defence made its decision in that regard in the interests of the economy.On Deputy Gormley's question, I have no ambition to be transported by helicopter. I am scared stiff at the notion of having to travel by helicopter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The Minister may have to get used to it.

As I understand it, helicopters will only be available to Ministers when absolutely necessary. They will not be used by Ministers as a general tool of transport.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The term VIP covers a broad range of people such as the Chief of Staff and Army top brass. I do not know exactly to whom the term VIP refers but I will make inquiries for the Deputy.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	64	It does not apply in Limerick.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	65	There are very few VIPs in Limerick. On Deputy McGinley's point, I am not aware of the confrontation between the Government and company concerned as it happened well before my time. I am, however, aware that Sikorsky is one of the companies that has tendered for the supply of the six helicopters. The tenders are being evaluated by designated persons and it is intended that a contract will be placed before Christmas. The time of delivery will depend on various matters such as the order books and so on of the successful company.It is intended each helicopter will be fitted with two 7.6 millimetre machine guns which will be removable. Given part of the function of such military aircraft will be to provide aid to the civil power, it may be necessary for them to be armed in certain circumstances. However, Members can rest assured the guns will be detached when the aircraft are performing search and rescue operations or air ambulance duties.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Based on GNP figures received from the Central Statistics Office gross expenditure on defence was 1.3% in 1994 and not 1.6% as indicated in the Deputy's question. The level of expenditure on defence in any particular country is influenced by a variety of factors, including the country's political and security environment, its history, demography and economy.There has been an unprecedented level of expenditure on infrastructure and equipment for the Defence Forces in recent years. This was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the re-organisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment. More than €174 million was spent on the capital investment programme for the upgrade of barracks, accommodation and other facilities between 1997 and end of 2003. This year's Defence Estimate includes a further €19 million for such capital works.Significant progress has also been made in recent years with the acquisition of modern equipment for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service, details of which I will provide in reply to a later question.

I was quoting from an article in An Cosantóir which specifically stated the amount allocated to Defence had dropped from 1.6% of GNP to 0.8%.The figure of 0.8% can be fairly misleading because it included an element of the proceeds of property sales, something we cannot depend on in future. I specifically heard the Minister say in Letterkenny last Thursday that he does not have on his agenda the proposed sale of any further barracks, so that source of revenue is drying up. Is the Minister aware that senior members of the Defence Forces have expressed concern at the reduction in revenue available to the Defence Forces? While such reductions may not have repercussions for the near future, the long-term viability and efficiency of the Defence Forces will be affected if we repeatedly continue to reduce funding.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I asked a similar question of the Minister's predecessor who suggested the allocation to the Defence Forces had been reduced to 0.6% last year. I will have to check up on that figure.Does the Minister accept that Ireland has the lowest defence spending in Europe as a percentage of GNP? The Minister said the United States spends almost 3.25% of GDP in this area. Does the Minister accept the analysis of many economists that one of the reasons for Ireland's economic performance in latter years has been the fact that our spend on defence is much lower than in other countries?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I am amazed that Deputy Gormley is concerned about the reduction in expenditure on defence. There is no comparison between the United States and Ireland in that regard.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I am saying that we are better off.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I thought the Deputy was worried that the percentage is decreasing. Looking at overall expenditure on defence in the context of the budget, we were able to reduce expenditure as a percentage of GDP because we had money coming in from savings as a result of reductions in personnel and the sale of surplus property. Defence expenditure would not have made any major difference to our economic performance in the past ten years.In 1994, the gross expenditure on defence was €546 million and in 2004 it will be €900 million. Inflation between 1994 and 2004 was 40%, whereas the gross expenditure on the defence and Army pensions Votes increased by about 65% in the same period, a substantial increase. I accept Deputy McGinley's point that the sale of property and other one-off funding sources is drying up but I have no plans to sell any more barracks. There may be some minor property sales but no more barracks will be sold. I must now go back to the Estimates system to get money to ensure the substantial improvements to equipment, infrastructure, efficiency and training are maintained. The House can rest assured that I will fight my corner at the Cabinet table to ensure sufficient resources are forthcoming for those purposes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The most important defence against terrorist attacks is detection and prevention by the security forces. While the Garda Síochána has the primary responsibility for law and order, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances.The level of any terrorist threat to Ireland is continually assessed. The advice available to me would suggest that while the terrorist threat to Europe is currently high, for Ireland it is low. However, it is prudent that we take precautions and keep matters under continuous review.The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the State may be at risk. An urgent and detailed review to deal with a range of emergency situations was undertaken by the military authorities following the events of 11 September. It included, inter alia, an update of the threat assessment, intensive contacts with other State agencies, a reassessment of operations orders relating to vital installations, alert systems, the Army ranger wing, ordnance and engineer aspects in terms of explosive ordnance disposal and specialist search and a review of equipment including the need for air defence. All matters arising were addressed and all procedures updated as required.The assets available to the Defence Forces are related to the level of threat and are considered appropriate in this regard. Air defence capability requires the integrated use of aircraft, radar and air and ground-based weapons systems. The Defence Forces have a limited ground-to-air capacity. That has always been the position. The new Pilatus trainer aircraft will enhance the airborne elements of our air defence capability. However, we will still continue to operate a limited air-to-air and air-to-ground defence capability.It would be inappropriate of me to go into specific details about the readiness, deployment arrangements or the speed of deployment or re-deployment of defence assets. However, I can confirm that all Air Corps aircraft have adequate numbers of operationally trained air crew who can operate from Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, which is available on a 24 hour basis where required. The shortest scramble time applicable in the Air Corps in certain circumstances is two minutes.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The two minute part is very impressive but the preamble worries me. To what extent is the Minister satisfied that adequate resources and equipment are available to the Air Corps and the rest of the Defence Forces in the event of a surprise terrorist attack? On whom can the Minister and the Defence Forces rely for assistance in the event of such an attack, particularly for prior warning, thereby giving the Defence Forces time to get into the air or to make the necessary preparations?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The primary responsibility in the event of a terrorist attack lies with the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces would come in response to a request for assistance. We have a limited air defence capacity but the events of 11 September showed that countries that spend a fortune on air defence cannot guarantee protection. Small countries do not spend resources that could be used for other things on air defences for that simple reason, although Israel is an exception to that. The money we spend on air defence is related to our assessment of the terrorist threat, which is currently low.Countries like ours that cannot afford a huge air defence system like the United States or Britain have a simple choice. We either have a token air defence system or we have a range of tasks that can be performed in certain situations in a professional way and we have gone for the latter option. We have our own early warning systems. In the event of a foreign, air-borne terrorist threat to this country, our near neighbours would be on high alert because they would also feel threatened.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Our near neighbours are already on red alert. No less an authority than Commissioner Sir John Stevens of the Metropolitan Police has stated that it is not a question of if but when there is a major attack on London or the UK. Does the Minister agree that Sellafield could be a prime target? What preparations have we engaged in to prevent anything coming from that direction? Iodine tablets have been distributed but what other preparations have been made? Does the Minister agree that these terrorists look for a soft target and that Shannon Airport may be attractive to them? When the UK is on red alert we cannot take anything for granted.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Does the Minister agree that a land attack is more likely than a sea or air attack? Does he believe there are terrorist operatives in this country and is he co-operating with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this? Are those people being observed? What is the state of readiness in intelligence terms?

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Staff Lieutenant General Jim Sreenan has stated that the Army should prepare for a dirty bomb attack. According to him, the major concern would be an attack similar to that which took place in Madrid. Other European countries have strengthened their security and we must be seen to do the same. What action has been taken to do this?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	79	To answer Deputy Sherlock first, I have already outlined the very considerable expenditure on training, equipment and infrastructure which the Government has engaged in over the past several years. A system is currently in place which all the military advice available to me suggests is as good as we can have in the circumstances. Procedures are in place in the event of a terrorist attack. I chair an emergency task force which will deal with the fall-out from a particular situation. For obvious reasons I will not divulge too many details about the action to be taken in that situation. The Deputy can rest assured that procedures are in place and it is my hope that we will never have to use them.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Minister should not keep it a secret too long.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	81	In answer to Deputy Gormley's question about specific terrorist operatives, these matters are always kept under review. There is constant contact between the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and a coherent approach is taken in respect of any known or suspected terrorist who may be operating on Irish soil.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Are they operating here?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	83	We are over time on this question. We must proceed to the next question.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Are they operating in this country, to the Minister's knowledge?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Does the scramble time of two minutes include loading the guns?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The scramble time is two minutes and, as I stated, the new aircraft will be armed. On the question of whether terrorists are currently operating in this country, not to my knowledge, but if anything specific requires to be brought to my attention by my Department, I am confident it will do so.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	87	By 30 September 2004, a total of 16,726 claims had been received in my Department from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service. A total of 333 claims have been determined in court and 15,060 have been disposed of out of court, mainly through settlement, leaving a total of 1,333 claims outstanding at that date. The sum of €277.3 million has been paid in respect of hearing loss claims, including €93.3 million in plaintiffs' legal costs.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The Minister's predecessor reported that good progress was being made. What is the state of that progress and what lessons are being learned from the procedures to prevent a recurrence?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The circumstances which enabled people to sue successfully have been dealt with, for example, proper protective equipment has been issued. I am delighted to inform Deputy Sherlock that 11 claims per week was the norm in 2002. That figure decreased to four per week in 2003 and it is currently down to one claim per week. The early settlement scheme contributed to it being a lot less expensive than had been originally envisaged. That scheme terminated on 26 July 2002. My best estimate is that the situation will be resolved at a cost of just under €300 million, which certainly is money the Government could be using for other things but which, nevertheless, is far less than some of the original estimates, which ranged from €1 billion to €1.5 billion. I envisage that approximately €300 million will be the total cost of the Army deafness claims.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Minister may have given the answer but I did not hear it. What procedure is now in place to prevent a recurrence of the problem?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Certain circumstances enabled the court to find that the Army had been negligent in not providing proper protective equipment such as hearing muffs for soldiers during military training exercises. I am advised by the military authorities that all those procedures have been put in place to the satisfaction of the legal people who gave the advice in the first instance that the Government had a case to answer.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 30 together.There is an existing policy of ongoing recruitment to the Army ranger wing. Selection courses are held periodically and successful candidates are then taken into the Army ranger wing. A planned selection course is in progress. It is not known at this time how many personnel are likely to be successful on this course. The military authorities advise that the number of personnel serving in the Army ranger wing is less than 75. For security reasons it is not the policy to disclose the type of equipment available to the ranger wing.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I was under the impression that the strength of the Army ranger wing was approximately 100 and I am surprised to hear it is as low as 75. I believe there was some intention to increase the number of personnel to 120. Does the Minister agree that if the country was under attack, the ranger wing would be the first line of defence against terrorists? Are there plans to increase the number of personnel from 75, which is very low? Are those personnel who are currently in training additional to the 75?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Those personnel being trained at present are to maintain the complement of 75 and are not extra personnel. I will discuss the matter of possible increases in the numbers serving in the ranger unit with the military authorities. To my knowledge there are no plans at present to increase the numbers above 75 personnel. I will discuss Deputy McGinley's concerns with the appropriate military authorities. If it is necessary to make changes in that regard, I will present proposals to the Government.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I understood the Defence Forces had been lobbying for an increase in the numbers to 120. Is the unit specifically trained to deal with a siege such as happened in Beslan? As well as a review of the number of personnel in the unit, will the Minister also review the equipment supplied? In reference to an earlier question, would the ranger unit be part of the EU headline goal contingents which the Irish Government is pledging to assist?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	96	In answer to Deputy Gormley's questions, I do not know if the military authorities are lobbying for an increase in the number of personnel; they have not lobbied me as yet but I have only been in the Department for ten days and perhaps it will happen down the road.The ranger unit is specifically trained to deal with a siege. Its level of training is very high and its personnel are very well equipped. I will discuss the question of equipment with the military authorities when I am discussing the size of the unit, as suggested by Deputy Gormley, because that is a logical decision.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	97	Is it true that the ranger wing operates overseas and is the Minister satisfied that there are sufficient numbers of its personnel present in the State to cope with any emergency that might arise?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I forgot to answer Deputy Gormley's other question about whether members of the ranger wing can be part of the EU headline force. My understanding is that it can include members of the ranger wing. Deployment abroad of members of the Army ranger wing and the consequent size of the force remaining in this country are under review at all times. The Government will ensure that there are sufficient personnel in the country to deal with any emergency or contingency that may arise.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	99	Will the Minister state the countries where the rangers are currently deployed and the numbers in each country?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I am unable to provide that information in the House today but I will communicate the information to Deputy Gormley.Question No. 15 answered with QuestionNo. 9.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	101	A total of 28 non-commissioned officers have been commissioned as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service in the past five years. Potential officers courses, POC, are held for non-commissioned personnel from time to time within the Defence Forces. Personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force. Participants on such courses are selected on a competitive basis. In addition, from time to time, non-commissioned personnel who hold appropriate qualifications are commissioned to fill specialist appointments where vacancies arise. Eligible non-commissioned personnel may also apply for the annual cadetship competitions. The requirement for potential officer courses and commissioning from the ranks competitions is reviewed from time to time and is being specifically addressed in the context of the integrated personnel management system which is one of the major policy initiatives provided for in the White Paper on Defence and in the programme for Government. The integrated personnel management system will make specific and ongoing provision for the introduction of regular schemes to commission enlisted personnel as officers in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.Draft conditions governing the appointment of enlisted personnel of the Permanent Defence Force to be officers of the Naval Service are under discussion with the representative associations. As the discussions with the representative associations are ongoing, it would not be appropriate to comment on the specifics of the proposed draft conditions. However, it is the intention that a potential officers' course will be run as soon as these discussions have been completed.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Will the Minister agree it was stated previously that a Defence Forces integrated personnel management system was being prepared by military management as a matter of priority? In the Cork area where efforts at promotion were made, I attempted to take up the case of a number of NCOs who see their career paths blocked despite the efforts of their direct superiors in the Naval Service. The career prospects for NCOs are bleak. As the Minister said in his reply, 28 non-commissioned officers have been commissioned as officers in the past five years. That is very limited promotion through the ranks. There should be a realistic prospect of promotion through the ranks, particularly given the shortages in the Naval Service.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I agree with the Deputy that promotion prospects are extremely limited. The figures clearly show that to be the case and they do not lie. The last such course which would enable enlisted personnel to become officers took place in 2000. It is the intention that as part and parcel of the integrated personnel management system those competitions will take place regularly. I do not wish to go into further detail given that discussions are ongoing with representative associations and I do not wish to pre-empt anything. It is my intention that the career paths and opportunities for enlisted personnel to get to officer level will be considerably enhanced. This is one result of the integrated personnel management system that we are trying to introduce.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Given that these discussions have been ongoing for a number of years what progress, if any, has been made? The replies I have received to parliamentary questions on the matter in recent years were to the effect that discussions were ongoing. Is there any sign of the discussions reaching a conclusion?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	105	Specific deadlines are set out in the White Paper on Defence. My understanding is that considerable progress has been made in the discussions and, hopefully, the matter will be resolved shortly. I am sure Deputy Stanton will continue to ask about the discussions until such time as the matter is resolved.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces will be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. I am aware that significant investment has taken place in recent years and I want to continue the good work in that regard.The unprecedented level of expenditure on equipment for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.Investment in new equipment for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service is provided for under various subheads of the defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, ships, naval stores etc. The total expenditure for 2002 for equipment under those subheads was €97 million. The corresponding figure for 2003 was €100 million.We have made excellent progress in terms of new equipment and better infrastructure and I will continue that process. The taxpayer gets extremely good value for money both in terms of home operations and duties overseas. At every available opportunity, I will champion the cause of ongoing investment and development of our Defence Forces. It is my desire that we continue to make substantial investment in new equipment and infrastructure in 2005 and beyond. While expenditure programmes will now have to be more prioritised I will ensure that a substantial re-equipment programme will continue to enhance the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service.This week sees the final delivery in the contract for the 25 additional armoured personnel carriers, which gives the Defence Forces 65 armoured personnel carriers in total. These armoured personnel carriers are on operational duties with our troops in Kosovo and Liberia. The initial contract for 40 armoured personnel carriers saw deliveries completed by March 2002 and was valued at €51 million, inclusive of VAT. The value of the additional contract is some €33 million inclusive of VAT with payments spread over the period 2002 to 2005.Another significant contract relates to the acquisition of the Javelin missile system from Raytheon-Lockheed Martin in the US at a cost of some €13 million inclusive of VAT. The purpose of this acquisition is to give Defence Forces personnel an effective, anti-armour capability while on peace support operations. The system will replace the Milan system. Some items under the contract have been delivered to allow for the training of personnel. The main delivery is scheduled for early 2005.Additional informationThere have been ongoing programmes of acquisitions of both nuclear biological chemical equipment and night vision equipment in recent years and these programmes will continue to meet the ongoing requirements of the Defence Forces.The acquisition of light tactical vehicles for the Defence Forces will also be considered in the light of the ongoing budgetary position. The main priority for the Air Corps has been the purchase of eight fixed wing training aircraft all of which have been delivered. The new aircraft is the Pilatus PC-9M, manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft Limited, Switzerland. The cost of the eight aircraft is approximately €60 million. While these aircraft are primarily for pilot training, they are capable of being armed and as such will have a limited defensive capability.The procurement process for the acquisition of new helicopters for the Air Corps is progressing well. This major investment programme involves the acquisition of six helicopters — two light utility helicopters primarily for Air Corps crew training purposes and four larger utility helicopters, with the option of two further such helicopters for use in support of the Army and for other ancillary uses such as air ambulance. It is expected that a contract for the acquisition of the helicopters will be signed before the end of the year.The Naval Service has also benefited from the investment programme in recent years with the acquisition of two new modern ships, LE Róisín and LE Niamh, at a cost of some €25 million each.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	107	What make of armoured personnel carriers were purchased? Is it true that many of these armoured personnel carriers require a huge amount of maintenance and are out of action for long periods? With regard to the value the public is getting for this equipment, what type of value for money audit takes place? It is no good if the equipment is broken down most of the time. My information is that they are Mowag armoured personnel carriers and cost approximately €1 million each. Are there other carriers that are cheaper and equally good? What amount of money was raised from the sale of the properties and did all the proceeds go towards Defence Forces equipment and the upgrading of other properties?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	108	It is not my information that there are substantial difficulties with maintaining these armoured personnel carriers. Certainly that has not been brought to my attention. I am aware that a detailed evaluation process, including value for money considerations, takes place when equipment of this magnitude is being purchased. That evaluation committee comprises personnel from the relevant section of the Army, whether the Air Corps, the Naval Service or the Permanent Defence Force. It also includes a number of personnel from the Department of Defence. I would be amazed if Deputy Stanton's assertion was correct. As the Deputy will be aware the initial contract was for 40 armoured personnel carriers following which we contracted to purchase an additional 25 armoured personnel carriers. If these problems arose in respect of the initial 40 armoured personnel carriers, surely no properly instructed person involved in the evaluation process would dare recommend the purchase of the additional 25 armoured personnel carriers. That matter would have been brought to the attention of the Minister. I do not recall the Deputy's other question.

It all went back into the Department of Defence.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 21 together.During Ireland's Presidency of the EU, my Department was responsible for progressing the military aspects of the European security and defence policy as well as co-ordinating the ministerial air transport service and Defence Forces aid to the civil power.Costs to my Department arising from the Irish Presidency of the European Union come under two headings, (a) those which arose as a result of the Department's role in taking forward work in relation to the European security and defence policy and (b) those which arose as a consequence of the provision of support by the Defence Forces to the Presidency in the form of security, transport, logistical support etc. and the ministerial air transport service. Costs under (a) amounted to some €229,000. Costs under (b) amounted to some €1,409,430. Therefore, the total cost was of the order of €1,638,430.The roles of the Defence Forces as assigned by Government are set out in the White Paper on Defence, which was published in February 2000. To aid the civil power, meaning in practice to assist when requested the Garda Síochána, which has the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State, is among the assigned roles. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assisted the Garda as required in duties during the Irish Presidency of the European Union. The additional costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of assistance to the Garda Síochána amounted to approximately €1,409,430. The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assisted the Garda as required in duties, which included the security operation surrounding the ceremonies marking the accession of new member states to the EU on 1 May 2004.I am advised that more than 2,500 personnel were deployed in various roles in connection with the security operation surrounding the ceremonies marking the accession of new member states to the EU on 1 May 2004. In addition, the Naval Service was on patrol in the Irish Sea and the Air Corps provided air traffic control capability and support to operations both at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel and in the Phoenix Park. The additional costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of assistance to the Garda Síochána on 1 May amounted to approximately €872,650. A breakdown of these costs follows.The Garda also requested the support of the Defence Forces for the visit from 25 to 26 June 2004 of the US President during the US-EU summit. I am advised that approximately 2,262 members of the Permanent Defence Force were deployed on security duties in connection with the visit. The additional costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of assistance to the Garda Síochána on 25 and 26 June 2004 amounted to approximately €448,000. A breakdown of these costs also follows.The additional costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of Army drivers for the EU Presidency VIP fleet of cars amounted to approximately €88,780.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I congratulate the Tánaiste on her appointment as Minister for Health and Children. Many within her own party have hailed the Tánaiste as some sort of Messiah come to resurrect the health service from complete disintegration. The Tánaiste is an experienced politician and I am sure the House wishes her well in her endeavours to restore a health service that the people deserve, but how can we be sure this is not just another false dawn?If the Tánaiste wants any sobering reading in this regard, I recommend today's ESRI report which gives an independent snapshot of our health care system in the eighth year of this Government. In a comparison of 22 national health systems using three established performance indicators, Ireland came last and second last in two areas. Ireland had among the highest levels of alcohol consumption, is at the bottom of the league for childhood immunisations and is joint last with Japan in non-medical factors. Ireland ranked second last in health outcomes such as heart attack rates, cancer and suicide.This country has the highest rates in the OECD of male and female mortality for heart attacks and is ranked "poor" for potential years of life lost due to female breast cancer. Ireland also ranked 14th out of 22 in the analysis of health status. We scored very poorly on infant mortality and our life expectancy figures from birth for both men and women was in the bottom one third of the countries surveyed. The Government is now in its eighth year and has spent €44 billion on the health service but the ESRI report suggests that the achievements have been almost negligible and are certainly nothing to boast about.In the Tánaiste's analysis of her first week in office as Minister for Health and Children, can she give the House three targets she expects to achieve in the next 18 to 24 months? For instance, will the broken promise of the delivery of 200,000 medical cards be honoured? Will we see an end to waiting lists during her tenure of office and does she expect to end the chaos in accident and emergency units throughout the country? Will she give us three tangible targets by which we can set performance indicators?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I thank Deputy Kenny for his good wishes and assure him I am no Messiah. There is no magic wand and I have no silver bullet.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	117	Where is the Messiah?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	118	We cannot continue to put more and more money into the health services without serious reform, a fact everyone in the House acknowledges. The good news is that we have more nurses per capita than any other country in the OECD, although they and other health workers do not come cheap. In order to meet benchmarking and salary increases next year, we will need an additional €500 million.One of the priority areas is accident and emergency units. It is unacceptable that people have to spend upwards of 12 hours on a trolley before they are admitted to a bed in an acute hospital. Allied to that are step-down facilities for the elderly, many of whom are in acute hospitals because there are no alternative services. A second ambition of mine is to reduce waiting lists. In that context, the national treatment purchase fund is making a major impact having treated 19,000 people to date. I want to continue to fund and support that, perhaps by extending its remit, because it is having a major impact through the use of facilities in the independent sector in Ireland and elsewhere to treat patients who have been waiting a long time.A third priority area is the extension of the income thresholds for medical cards, which we all accept are too low. I cannot give commitments in regard to numbers but it is important that we concentrate on income thresholds, which I will make a priority. I also intend to prioritise oncology services.I hope that in two and a half years we can make major achievements in those four areas as well as in health promotion. Ireland's health spending since 1997 has been double the OECD and EU averages. When spending is combined with outcomes such as dependency on alcohol, as Deputy Kenny acknowledged, suicide, cardiac disease and so on, the ESRI's combination of findings puts us in the position reported today. It is the Government's top priority in the next two and half years to accompany additional resources with radical reform.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	119	In respect of the Tánaiste's answer on accident and emergency departments, will she publish a benchmarking system so we can know of increased performance according to length of stay in accident and emergency departments? Will she publish a benchmarking system in respect of those waiting six hours, eight hours, ten hours, 12 hours or more?In 2001, the Government promised more than €1 billion over ten years for the primary care sector. Only €16 million has been spent in this area. The Government still refers to ten pilot projects when we were told that there would be 600 delivered by 2012.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Deputy's minute has concluded.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I could not have not used my minute yet. I am not sure what stimulant the Ceann Comhairle is on today, but a minute does not go that quickly.The budget for mental health dropped from 11% to 7% last year. The task force report on suicide is critical. Travelling the country, I heard the advertisements broadcast nationally for breastcheck, which are very good advertisements. The advertisement states that the procedure is perfectly confidential, safe, takes twenty minutes and provides a phone number. It goes on to state that it is only available in the east and in the midlands. Women in every other area suffer the trauma of hearing these advertisements about saving lives, yet they themselves are not in a position to avail of this very necessary service. Perhaps the Tánaiste might look into that as a matter of real urgency, not just for the facility, but for the business of systematic breast service facilities.All of this was put into perspective for me yesterday by a man who stood in my own office in Castlebar, with a bag of blood and urine attached to his leg. He was on a nine year waiting list for urology services in the Mayo General Hospital and he will also have to wait 18 months before the consultant in Galway will be able to see him. When one talks to someone like that, one can understand the urgency, the fright and the trauma of what they have to go through. One can understand how badly people feel when they know that €44 billion has been spent in the past ten years. A hard-working man now has to go around like a cripple and feels he is going to die, yet the consultant cannot see him for 18 months. That is what the Tánaiste has to deal with. I will support her in many of the measures she has to implement, as the patient's interest has to be put first. We will not allow a system to be removed from people; we want a health system that is close to them and operates based on their need as distinct from what they have got in their pockets.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I thank the Deputy for his support in the case in Mayo. I do not know if it is a suitable case for the national treatment purchase fund. One of the issues surrounding accident and emergency is the lack of data. I have asked for patient data to be made available over the next two weeks as it is not collected at the moment. This is so that we can know the kind of cases with which we are dealing, the frequency of visits and so on. Tomorrow afternoon, I will meet the CEOs of all the Dublin hospitals regarding accident and emergency services. Suffice to say that this is a priority for me, for the Government and for the country. I appreciate the support the Deputy is offering. I know he cannot support me all the time, but I appreciate the spirit in which he offers that support.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Like Deputy Kenny, I wish the Tánaiste success in the health portfolio. She has set out three priorities and I do not dispute them. It is urgent that they be dealt with after the many years of drift. Deputy Kenny referred to the publication of the ESRI report today, and to the fact that we are second from the bottom of 22 OECD countries in comparative performance on health status indicators. This means the general health of the country, as compared to those countries, is second from the bottom.Specifically on the mental health services does the Tánaiste appreciate that as a total percentage of the health budget, we now spend just over 6% of the total health budget compared with 11% in the 1990s? Does she agree that the mental health services are the Cinderella of the health service? What is the status of Government policy following the announcement of her colleague, Deputy O'Malley, in respect of the sale of public lands surrounding 14 psychiatric hospitals in the country and the commitment that that money will be ploughed back into the psychiatric services? Is that Government policy? Has the Department of Finance or the new Government stopped it? What is the status of it? I ask this because of a particular case in the Tánaiste's constituency, where €31 million has been realised from the sale of lands around St. Loman's. A commitment was given that it would be used in an area that has the poorest provision of psychiatric services per capita in the country, although it has the highest clinical demand. I speak of community areas four and five. The sale of the lands realised €31 million, but only €15 million has been dedicated to the psychiatric services. How can that be reconciled with the announcement with much fanfare during the summer, of the transformation of land assets into what the Minister called health assets, specifically for the mental health services?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	124	More resources into mental health is a priority. We have to ensure that people who require institutional care live in the best possible circumstances. Among the issues I would like to see dealt with is the situation regarding the Central Mental Hospital. All of these issues require resources, including the removal of people with intellectual disabilities from mental health institutions. The intention is that any resources that can be found from the disposal of assets would go into that area. We need to carry out an audit of what we can generally sell in the country. There are quite a number of properties currently in the possession of health boards, soon to be in the possession of the HSE, that will not be required for health related facilities. I would like to see those disposed of in an orderly manner and the resources raised put into health care, including mental health.There is one proviso. We also have commitments on social and affordable housing. Each Department was asked some time ago to provide sites for social and affordable housing. We have to marry a number of different priorities. As far as I and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley are concerned, we have to put more resources into the development of modern state-of-the-art facilities in the mental health area.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The progress on social and affordable housing has been weak. The Tánaiste should consult the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform; I notice he is making considerable progress in one-off housing down the country.Can the Tánaiste please deal with the question? Is it Government policy to sell off the land surrounding the psychiatric institutions and to dedicate the money to the development of the psychiatric services? That is the specific question. The Tánaiste said she would like to see them being sold off and the resources dedicated to the mental and general services. The Minister of State made a clear announcement and what I am trying to establish is whether it means anything. Is that the purpose for which the lands will be sold off? I gave the example of St. Loman's, where €31 million was realised in the sale and €15 million was dedicated to the services. Why was that the case? Will the Tánaiste do something about it? I cannot believe that seven and a half years later, we are talking about doing an audit. There was no audit done when religious lands were sold off. On the other hand, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, has had no difficulty in purchasing lands all around the country for a decentralisation programme more realised in the imagination than in reality. We are to do an audit seven and a half years later. That really is not good enough when people are suffering deprivation in the psychiatric services area. A report, The Stark Facts, produced by the Irish Psychiatric Association shows that resources, including clinical resources, are concentrated in areas that are least deprived. In terms of a service regarded generally as the poor relation of the health services, the areas most deprived of psychiatric services are the poorest areas in the country.

I know what the Tánaiste would like to do. I do not question her good motivation. What is Government policy on this matter and when will it be implemented?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	128	Specifically in regard to St.Loman's, I am not in a position to advise the Deputy what happened to the missing €15 million from the mental health area, although perhaps I can check that.The overall policy is that any sale in the health area that can be made should go generally into health, with one proviso in respect of social and affordable housing. My Department, like every other Department, has been asked to come forward with land that may be suitable for social and affordable housing. To the best of my knowledge, there is no formal Government decision in regard to this matter, but that would be the intention. As far as audits are concerned, it will not be a long drawn out audit, but in the Department of Heath and Children we do not have a piece of paper that indicates what lands may be available to be disposed of over the next year or 18 months. It would be very useful if we knew what we could dispose of with a view to putting the money into health care.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I want to raise a number of issues concerning people originating from outside the European Union now seeking refuge and shelter in this State on humanitarian grounds. The Tánaiste told the "Gerry Ryan Show" on Tuesday last correctly that a hard line should be taken against the atrocity known as female genital mutilation, also called FGM. Will she consider making FGM and the threat of this barbarism grounds for getting refuge in this State? Will she intervene with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give humanitarian leave to remain in this State to Juliet Imiruaye, a victim of FGM, a campaigner when a midwife in Nigeria against FGM, and in the five years she has been in Ireland a woman who has contributed extensively to that campaign, against whom now unfortunately a deportation order has been made? It is reported in The Irish Times  today that there is a slight window of opportunity. I ask the Tánaiste to intervene in this regard.A further cohort of parents of Irish born children, born before the Supreme Court judgment and the constitutional referendum on citizenship, are in an awful limbo, daily facing the anguish of uncertainty which extends to their many supporters and friends, Irish born, in the community.I know the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has much to occupy his mind over the next week. If he goes to Roscommon for the weekend he may be obliged to sit in his tent wrapped in his sleeping bag as he has no permanent roof there. Will the Tánaiste ask him if he will concede to those who do not even have one home humanitarian leave to find that home with their children in this country?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I very much share the Deputy's view in regard to female genital mutilation. I have spoken to the Attorney General about this matter and he assured me that it is covered under the Offences Against the Person Act. I have spoken to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in regard to Juliet Imiruaye and he has agreed to give her a stay of six months while he reviews the case. I very much hope as a result of that stay of six months and the review he will be in a position to allow her to stay on humanitarian grounds because she has made a major impact in Ireland in regard to this issue.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	134	That is a very positive development. We would be a disgrace in front the nations and peoples of the world if we were to deport a woman in Juliet Imiruaye's position.Will the Tánaiste elaborate on her last comment on whether she also appreciates the particular case of some thousands of people with children who are Irish citizens who were advised quite solidly by the legal profession and others to withdraw their application for asylum on foot of a hope of residency before the Supreme Court judgment? They constitute a category that needs urgent intervention. The ESRI or other reports that have been published in the past week indicate that these people's labour will certainly be needed here. Their situation requires particular intervention. Will the Tánaiste positively consider their position?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	135	The more general question is more appropriate to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The legislation that is required on foot of the referendum will come to the House shortly.In regard to the specific case, because of the contribution Juliet made in regard to this issue and the contribution she has made in regard to health services generally and given that she asked me to intervene, I was very happy to do that on her behalf.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I, too, would like this matter to return to the House as it refers, although not explicitly, to the Civil Service Commission and the dispersal of civil servants throughout the country. That there are only two people from the Civil Service Commission offering to be moved to Youghal to date indicates the need to examine closely whether Government policy has any basis, whether it will be possible to follow it through and whether we need to consider a plan B. There is a need for a debate.

The Tánaiste and longer-serving Members of the House will recall when a four foot wall had to built around the home of a Minister for Justice.

What is the progress on this legislation? Likewise, given that the ESRI is reminding us that older people in Ireland are twice as likely to be poor than those in the rest of the EU——

The 1995 Adoptive Leave Act provides leave similar to maternity leave for an adopting mother after the placement of a child into her care. The purpose of the Act was to redress a perceived anomaly that women who adopted children were excluded from the maternity leave entitlements in place under the Maternity Protection Act 1994. The 1995 Act replicates all the relevant benefits of the maternity protection legislation for women whose motherhood arises from adoption and its provisions were modelled on existing arrangements for natural mothers. Provision is also made in the Act for similar leave for men in exceptional circumstances which arise where the employee is a sole male adopter or if the adopting mother dies either shortly before or shortly after placement of the child.The maternity working group, some of whose recommendations form the basis of the Adoptive Leave Bill, was set up as a result of a commitment made in the Government's An Action Programme for the Millennium and under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. The working group was chaired by my Department and included representatives from all pillars of social partnership, relevant Departments, the Health Service Employers' Agency, the Health and Safety Authority and the Equality Authority. The group's recommendations were accepted in full by the Government. The Government also decided to amend the Adoptive Leave Act to incorporate, where appropriate, the improvements proposed to the Maternity Protection Act. The most important recommendation, which was to extend the duration of maternity and additional maternity leave by four weeks each, was immediately implemented by statutory instrument in March 2001, with identical increases applied simultaneously to adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave, again by statutory instrument. This brought the statutory adoptive leave entitlement, which attracts payment of salary or adoptive benefit, to 14 weeks and the additional unpaid adoptive leave entitlement to eight weeks. The remaining recommendations of the working group of relevance to adoptive leave require primary legislation to amend the Adoptive Leave Act and these will be implemented on the enactment of this Bill.The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 was introduced to provide an entitlement to periods of leave from employment for an adopting mother after the placement of a child into her care on an equivalent basis to the entitlement to leave available in the maternity protection legislation to natural mothers. This equivalence was maintained in 2001 when matching increases in the periods of leave available to natural and adopting mothers were applied. In keeping with this policy, an amendment to the maternity leave provisions in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 will also be applied to adoptive leave. Section 3 of that Act provides for the reduction of the compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave from four weeks to two weeks, thereby increasing the period of such leave available after the birth of the child to 16 weeks. With a view to maintaining the parity of entitlement between adopting and natural mothers, the Government has agreed to increase the period of adoptive leave by two weeks to 16 weeks. This provision in section 3 of the Bill effectively means that both natural and adopting mothers will be entitled to avail of up to 16 weeks' leave from work with payment of Department of Social and Family Affairs benefit from the time a child is born or placed into their care.The increase in leave to 16 weeks will be implemented by means of an order amending the Adoptive Leave Act 1995. As Deputies know, the draft order was considered earlier today by the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, and a resolution approving the order will be made shortly. The increase is being implemented in this manner so that adopting parents can avail of the increased leave provisions at an earlier date in advance of the enactment of the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 to coincide roughly with the commencement of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004.The adoption of a child into a family requires considerable advance preparation and adjustment. The adoption process is a long and anxious journey for adopting parents but happily in the majority of cases it culminates in the fulfilment of their wishes to have a child. For good reason, the preparatory and assessment process is thorough and demands the full commitment of adopting parents. It is important to ensure that those wishing to adopt are given every support throughout this period and that support extends after placement to allow time for bonding and adjustment. The measures introduced in the Adoptive Leave Bill will enhance the existing legislative provisions which support employed adopting parents. The Bill achieves this by allowing more flexibility in managing work and family responsibilities during this period and by offering greater employment protection to employees who exercise their right to adoptive leave.A good approximation of the number of employees availing of adoptive leave may be deduced from the number of recipients of adoptive benefit payments made by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. In 2003, there were 183 recipients of adoptive benefit while in 2002 there were 215 recipients. The numbers of children available for domestic adoption in recent years has declined and given rise to a marked growth in the number of foreign adoptions. According to the Adoption Board, unofficial figures for 2003 show that of the 621 adoptions authorised that year, 358 were foreign adoptions, 92 were Irish non-family adoptions and the remaining 171 were adoptions within families.As a consequence of the growth in foreign adoptions, the Department of Health and Children introduced a structured approach in preparing and assessing prospective adopters for inter-country adoptions. As part of this structure, adopting parents are now required under the standardised framework for inter-country adoption to attend a series of preparatory group sessions organised by their local health board or adoption agency. Participation in the education and preparation stage of the standardised framework is compulsory for adopting parents. Participation in the standardised framework will be made a statutory requirement under legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Health and Children to ratify the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. This important stage of the process gives prospective adopters an opportunity to learn more about inter-country adoption so they can make an informed choice as to whether this is an appropriate step for them to take. It provides them with an opportunity to evaluate and improve their own knowledge about inter-country adoption and a place to meet other applicants at a similar stage in the process and where mutual support and learning can take place.The education and preparation phase of the process takes the form of a course normally comprising six to eight three-hour sessions, giving 18 to 24 hours of preparation over a four-month period. Alternatively, some health boards run the course over three days. I understand the Department of Health and Children is encouraging health boards to explore the possibility of introducing more efficiencies in the education and preparation stage of the inter-country adoption process which may result in classes being held outside working hours and a reduction in the time between the completion of classes and the placement of a child.To complete the assessment phase of the standardised framework, all prospective adopters, whether they are involved in domestic or inter-country adoptions, are required to attend an average of five to seven pre-adoption meetings, each of about 1.5 to two hours' duration, with social workers. These meetings generally take place during regular office hours at the health board or adoption agency offices. However, this part of the assessment process also includes at least one home visit by a social worker.Many employers allow their employees paid time off from work to attend pre-adoption classes and meetings. However, there is no entitlement to time off, paid or otherwise, for this purpose. As a result, some employers only allow time off for this purpose at the employee's expense. To alleviate this, the Bill provides a new entitlement for adopting parents to time off from work, without loss of pay, for the purpose of the pre-adoption classes and meetings which they are obliged by the State to attend as part of the adoption process. This new provision parallels the provisions in the maternity protection legislation for paid time off work before the birth for pregnant women to attend ante-natal care appointments and classes. By providing an entitlement to both adopting parents, it also recognises that the adoption process differs from maternity in that it requires the full participation of each parent throughout the preparation and assessment process.Section 2 makes technical amendments to the interpretation provisions of the 1995 Act. I have already referred to section 3 which provides for an increase in the adoptive leave entitlement for employed adopting mothers or sole male adopters by two weeks to 16 weeks. Section 5 applies the increased adoptive leave period referred to in section 3 to adoptive leave for fathers in certain circumstances following the death of the adopting mother. It also provides that the Minister may, by order made with the consent of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance, extend the period of leave.In sections 4 and 6, I avail of the opportunity presented by the Bill to incorporate directly into the principal Act the increased periods of adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave provided in SI 30 of 2001, the Adoptive Leave (Extension of Periods of Leave ) Order 2001. This will simplify the legislation.I have already referred to the new entitlement provided in section 7 for employees to take time off from work, without loss of pay, to attend pre-adoption classes and meetings which they are obliged to attend as part of the adoption process. This new entitlement derives from an agreement negotiated with the social partners during the Sustaining Progress partnership talks in 2003. Subsection (4), which was inserted into the Bill following a Government amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad, clarifies that the provisions of this section apply to pre-adoption classes and meetings held within the State. Provision has also been made for the exclusion of members of the Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána from the provisions of this section in specified circumstances. It is intended that regulations under this section will specify the conditions with regard to time off to attend these classes and meetings.Section 8 is a new provision which allows an adopting employee and employer to agree to terminate additional adoptive leave which is unpaid leave in the event of the employee becoming ill. Once the leave is terminated, the employee's absence from work is treated in the same manner as any other absence from work due to sickness, with the employee benefiting from payment of sick pay or disability benefit depending on the sick leave arrangements available under the employment contract. This provision applies a recommendation of the maternity working group.Sections 9 and 10 are new provisions which allow an adopting employee and the employer to agree to postpone adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave or both in the event of the hospitalisation of the adopted child. The postponed leave may be taken subsequently in one continuous period commencing not later than seven days after the child is discharged from hospital. These provisions also apply a recommendation of the maternity working group regarding adoptive leave and are closely modelled on section 7 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004.Section 11 amends section 12 of the principal Act to incorporate an adopting parent's statutory entitlements in cases where placement is of less than 24 weeks' duration. Section 12 provides that an employee's absence from work on additional adoptive leave will count for any employment rights associated with the employment with the exception of remuneration and superannuation benefits. It also provides that while absent from work attending pre-adoption classes or meetings, employees will be treated as if they had not been absent. This provision applies a recommendation of the maternity working group for additional adoptive leave and means that time spent on such leave will be counted as service for the purposes of calculating increments, annual leave and seniority.Employees who are absent from work on adoptive leave, additional adoptive leave, or to attend pre-adoption classes and meetings are afforded protection under sections 13 and 14 with respect to the termination or suspension of their employment during such absence.Section 15 strengthens the current provisions covering the return to work of an employee who was on adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave to give effect to the 2002 gender equal treatment in employment directive, Directive 2002/73/EC. An employee returning to work from adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave will have a statutory entitlement to any improvement in the terms or conditions of the employment to which he or she would have been entitled if he or she had not been absent on such leave.Section 16 also ensures compliance with the 2002 gender equal treatment in employment directive by providing that in the event of an employee returning to work on the expiration of adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave but resumption of the same work is not practicable and suitable alternative work is offered, the terms or conditions of such employment shall not be less favourable to the employee than those of the contract of employment immediately before the leave. It also provides that such terms or conditions shall incorporate any improvement to which the employee would have been entitled had he or she not been absent from work on such leave.Section 17 is a technical amendment which amends the notification requirements for employees with regard to intent to return to work from leave to provide for notification of intent to return to work from postponed leave.Sections 18 and 19 provide for necessary amendments to sections 2 and 6, respectively, of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 to take account of the new rights to time off to attend pre-adoption classes or meetings under the Bill.Section 20 amends paragraph 5, Schedule 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, as amended by the Redundancy Payments Act 2003, which specifies periods that do not breach continuity of employment, to incorporate periods of absence from work to attend pre-adoption classes or meetings. Provision is also made for the amendment of Paragraph 8A, Schedule 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, as amended by the Redundancy Payments Act 2003, which specifies absences allowable as reckonable service, to incorporate periods of absence from work to attend pre-adoption classes or meetings.Section 21 revokes the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 (Extension of Periods of Leave) Order 2001, S.I. No. 30 of 2001, as its provisions have been incorporated into this Bill.I take this opportunity to refer briefly to other important developments taking place with regard to adoption. My colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, the Minister of State with responsibility for children, initiated a consultation process last year on adoption legislation. His intention is to undertake a complete review of adoption legislation in Ireland with the aim of making it more compatible with life in the 21st century by ensuring that it takes account of the huge changes in our society as well as changing trends and practices in adoption that have taken place since the 1952 Adoption Act. The consultation process was broad-ranging and examined a number of issues, including a draft Bill to provide for ratification of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption and to make changes to the role and structure of the Adoption Board. The Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption provides safeguards for children involved in inter-country adoption by regulating the processes by which children are adopted.The consultation process also examined the provision of a structured and regulated way of providing access to information and contact for those affected by adoption. It provided many valuable insights into these and other sensitive issues needing to be addressed, either on a legislative or an administrative basis. The views garnered through the process have been examined in the context of preparing proposals for changes to the adoption legislation. I understand that the Minister hopes to submit proposals to Government this autumn and I look forward with interest to developments in this regard.The Adoptive Leave Bill before the House is part of a suite of statutory work-life balance measures to which the Department is committed under the Sustaining Progress partnership agreement. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 implements in full the recommendations of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. Its provisions strengthen and improve the employment rights of pregnant mothers, women who have recently given birth and those who wish to resume work while breastfeeding. Regulations under the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 which have recently been finalised will provide for detailed arrangements on the new entitlements to time off from work, without loss of pay, for the purpose of attending ante-natal classes; breaks from work or a reduction of working hours, without loss of pay, for the purpose of breastfeeding; and to postpone the period of maternity leave in the event of hospitalisation of the child. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 will be commenced next Monday, 18 October.The Parental Leave Act 1998 is also due for amendment in line with the agreed recommendations of a working group which reviewed that Act. On 8 September last the Government approved the general scheme of a Bill to amend the 1998 Act for priority drafting. I expect to publish the Bill later this year with a view to enactment at the earliest possible date.I look forward to Deputies' contributions to the debate on the Adoptive Leave Bill. I believe the Bill represents a balanced and progressive response to the needs of employed adopting parents. It builds on progress already made on our employment equality legislation and marks another important step towards fulfilling the Government's commitments in Sustaining Progress. I commend the Bill to the House.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I wish the Minister of State well in his new portfolio and hope it goes well for him. He will certainly have plenty to do in this area of justice.I acknowledge the work of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. Most of the recommendations it put forward have been addressed by this Bill. I commend the Government on bringing the Bill forward, although there have been some delays in doing so. Many parents have waited anxiously for it for some time and I am delighted it is now before us.The adoption process is difficult and parents need all the support they can get to get through it, without the added worry of employment concerns. The Minister is aware that the adoption process is a long and tough experience. Applicants to an adoption agency undergo a detailed assessment which can last up to two years. As a result of this Adoptive Leave Bill, they can concentrate on the adoption process knowing that they will have the right to take time off work to pursue their dream of starting or extending their family.I have a concern which I hope will be clarified. Adoptive parents will be entitled to take 16 weeks' leave after an adoption. This is different from the entitlement of natural parents who will have two weeks' leave prior to birth, giving them a total of 18 weeks' leave. Is that correct and does this imply discrimination against the person adopting a child? Although adoptive parents do not need to spend time in hospital to have the baby, they need preparation time off beforehand to prepare and organise for the arrival of the child. Will the Minister of State clarify that as I may be interpreting the provision wrongly? Both natural and adoptive parents should receive the same leave entitlement.The Bill increases the amount of time off for parents. Similar provision is made for men in exceptional circumstances, for example, where the man is the sole adopter or where the adopting mother dies either shortly before or after the placement of the child. I discussed this point with my colleague, Deputy Enright, and I would like it clarified. Is a father entitled to the leave or must we assume that it is the mother or female parent who gets the full entitlement? Does a father only get it if he is a sole adoptor or if the mother dies? Surely, in this age of equality a father should be entitled to parental leave. Perhaps I have interpreted this provision wrongly, but should there not be an option for either parent to take time off. Adoption is difficult for both parents.The Bill provides for time off work without loss of pay for employees to attend pre-adoption classes and meetings, which prospective parents are obliged to attend. Will the Minister of State illustrate the protection afforded to people whose employers do not adhere to this provision? What steps can be taken to seek recourse in a dispute? We have come across cases where employers do not always provide entitlements or cause difficulty and put pressure on people not to take their leave or time off. What will be done to redress situations where employers take advantage of their employees during the adoption process? Will a complaints board be set up? What provisions are made for self-employed people who want to take time off to adopt?I welcome the extra leave and time off provided in this legislation. I also welcome the provision in the Bill where, if a child is ill or is hospitalised, parents can return to work for a time and resume the leave later when it suits them. If the parent is sick he or she can take sick leave and resume adoptive leave later. Will the Minister of State clarify what happens in a case where a person has commenced his or her leave, but the adoption does not go through?If adoptive parents begin their 16 weeks leave the week before the adoption but the adoption breaks down because something changes at the last minute, can they begin the process six months later, for example, or is there a limit? I hope there is no limit. The Bill introduces all the working group recommendations and I have no problem with it per se but I seek clarification because there should be equal access to adoptions for both females and males.The adoption process must be examined and I accept the Bill is one part of the legislative programme in this area. However, people are experiencing massive problems and delays, especially regarding inter-country adoptions. I have come across couples who have had serious difficulties organising adoptions in Belarus and elsewhere and that is a pity. They did not always get the support of the Adoption Board, to which they felt entitled. I recall one couple who felt they were nuisances even though they were trying to do some good for society, for themselves and an unfortunate child who needed a home. They were made to feel awkward about it and they were not helped, which is a shame.Various Bills can be introduced to give people additional time off and so on but that may only amount to tokenism because the legislation must be backed up with proper services and information so that parents are given the help they need. I hope the changes the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, proposes to bring forward will reflect that. He has tried his best in recent years in regard to the adoption process but more must be done.The Bill provides for couples to be given more time off to attend courses prior to adoption but there are significant waiting lists for both fostering and adoption in a number of health board areas. One couple who contacted me could have to remain on a waiting list for a course for two years. It could take two years for them to go through the process that would deem them suitable to become adoptive parents. Both of them are aged 40. They want to adopt children now because they feel they are at the right age but they cannot get accepted for a course to prepare themselves for adoption.The Bill is a start and, while it is positive and welcome, a great deal more needs to be done. The Adoption Board must guide people through the process. The legislation will provide more or less equal rights for both natural and non-natural parents. The Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003 passed through the House a number of months ago but people are not still clear about their entitlements under it. Leaflets were published and sent to homes or they can be picked up in social welfare offices but, despite this, the information regarding entitlements is not reaching people. There will always be employers who will not encourage employees to avail of their entitlements. They will begrudge them help on entitlements. There is an onus on us when we introduce new laws that improve entitlements to make sure they are successful. We need to inform and encourage people to seek advice, attend classes and so on regarding parenthood. We need to get the message out loud and clear. I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for bringing it forward.
#BreedaMoynihanCronin	unknown-#BreedaMoynihanCronin-party	unknown-#BreedaMoynihanCronin-dob	unknown-#BreedaMoynihanCronin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I wish the Minister of State well in his new portfolio. He will have a good start today because all the work on this legislation had been done prior to his appointment and he will, therefore, experience a honeymoon period.On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Bill and I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate. Many of its provisions were addressed in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 and we had a good debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on that. The most notable and welcome provision is the extension of the period of adoptive leave, following the recommendations of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. I regret it has taken almost three years to bring the Bill forward in contrast with the recent Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2004, which was railroaded through the House at break-neck speed last week. This legislation could have been introduced sooner.The perception for many years may have been that the arrival of an adopted child did not require the same advance preparation as did the birth of one's own child but this is not the case. The adoptive process is long and stressful for many parents, particularly where they adopt their child from abroad. The assessment process is intense, tough and lengthy for reasons we all fully understand and every support should be given to adoptive parents at this time.I welcome the Bill if it provides more support and solace to prospective adoptive parents. Due to the declining number of children available for adoption in Ireland, there has been significant growth in the number of foreign adoptions. For example, in 1997, there were only 84 foreign adoptions and that number increased dramatically to 647 in 2000. I am not aware of current figures and I would appreciate it if the Minister could provide them. I presume they are significant because many people like to adopt foreign children.With regard to foreign adoptions, the adoptive parents frequently must spend time in the country from which they intend to adopt the child. This will often mean having to take days or even weeks off work. A good friend of mine had to travel to the country involved on a number of occasions because difficulties arose. As Deputy English stated, couples experience difficulties with foreign adoptions and, while the time off provided in the legislation is welcome, it will not be sufficient in cases where there are difficulties. I understand we cannot legislate for that that but this issue should be examined in exceptional cases. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will update legislation on adoption in general and this issue should be considered then.I would like him to address another issue. I cannot understand why a woman must be younger than a man to adopt a child. Numerous surveys have been published over the years, which highlight that women live, on average, ten years longer than men. Perhaps the man should be younger. Why does a woman have to be younger than a man to adopt a child?I am pleased with the provision to allow adoptive parents time off work to attend pre-adoption classes and meetings, as they are obliged to anyway. This was an anomaly when compared to the provisions for parents who have children naturally. Significant preparation is involved before the adopted child is brought into the family. It is a life altering change for adoptive parents and families and the ability to attend the necessary classes and meetings should not be constrained by work commitments.All prospective adopters, whether they are involved in domestic or inter-country adoptions, are required to attend an average of six pre-adoption interviews with social workers to discuss their applications. These usually take place during the normal working day in the health board or adoption agency offices. This means, therefore, that prospective adoptive parents often have to give up a few days work to attend the interviews. The health boards usually provide courses and this often requires taking time off work as the courses run for a few days. Given the obligation on parents to attend these interviews, every support and all the necessary time should be given to the parents to fulfil these requirements.This Bill complements that Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003, which was passed earlier this year. While adoptive mothers do not have to go through pregnancy, their entitlements to leave from work should correspond to those for maternity leave. A new person is joining the family and an adoptive parent should be afforded the same time to spend with a new child as parents and a mother who has given birth to a child. It is, therefore, welcome that the Bill ends the noticeable differentiation between pregnant mothers and adoptive mothers in accordance with the Government's work-life balance programmes under the Sustaining Progress agreement.I ask the Minister to indicate in his reply whether he is satisfied that the number of social workers who conduct interviews with adoptive parents and work with them before the adoption is sufficient to meet demand. I remember dealing not too long ago with a woman who had been through the adoption process and expressed concerns about the low number of social workers in the field. Up to a few years ago, the Southern Health Board had the highest level of applications for adoption of all health boards, with 23% of all first applications for inter-country adoption. I understand that approximately six staff deal with applicants in the Southern Health Board. Does the Minister think this is sufficient? Over the years many people who applied to adopt found they were too old to do so by the time they were interviewed by social workers. This is a shame. People who propose to adopt a child should be supported rather than left for years until such time as they are too old.This legislation will have positive effects for Irish adoptive mothers in particular. As I said when I spoke on the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill in February, more and more women are in the Irish workforce. While women have been specifically targeted for employment in our workplaces at various times over recent years, many obstacles remain in their paths and many issues remain to be resolved. I refer Members again to recent statistics which bear out just how many women have joined the workforce in recent decades. The number of women working grew from 212,000 to 488,000 between 1976 and 1996, and by 2001 women comprised 50% of the workforce. The proportion of working women with partners and children increased from 44% to 50% in recent years. If we are to encourage women to remain in the workplace, we must encourage the introduction of legislation such as we are considering as well as more progressive provisions.Changes in maternity and adoptive leave provision have not kept pace with the dramatic increase in the number of women in the workforce. Many of the thousands of women who have joined the workforce in recent years are adoptive mothers and it is shameful that we are only now catching up after years of neglect in the adoptive leave area. In general, Ireland compares very poorly in a European context in terms of holiday entitlements for workers. We are far below the European average on public holidays and the amount of paid leave for employees in various circumstances. While the Bill goes some way to correcting this for adoptive parents, we have a long way to go to meet European norms of public and other holiday entitlement for the Irish workforce.When I spoke here in February on the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill, I referred briefly to child care. It is fitting to refer to this subject again in the context of the Adoptive Leave Bill. With many of the deficiencies in the area of maternity and adoptive leave addressed, it is time for the Government to turn its attention to the enormous child care crisis. An effective solution to the crisis would obviously have major benefits for adoptive parents as well as all other new parents. When couples adopt, child care may be one of the first priorities they must address. Figures outlined in a survey recently published on www.recruitireland.com showed that many Irish workers now spend more on child care than on their mortgages or rent. Clearly, the cost of providing child care is a major economic disincentive to work and effectively excludes many parents, particularly women, from re-entering the workforce.Given the cost of child care as outlined in the survey, it is clear that many parents and potential workers will not be able to provide such care without financial support from the Government. The Government has failed abysmally to meet the child care needs of working parents. Prior to the previous general election, the Progressive Democrats promised to fund an additional 40,000 child care places but the Government has come nowhere near meeting this figure. The Government has cut crèche supplements and slashed community employment schemes, including those which provided child care. Parents, including adoptive parents, require a range of options. There should be more workplace crèches and professionally-run child care centres. As a one-to-one private arrangement is most suitable for many parents, it should be possible for child minders to offer such a service without having to go though undue bureaucratic procedures.While Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, we lag far behind most other EU members states in the provision of child care facilities. The Government should concentrate its efforts on State-provided and funded child care which is affordable and accessible. I ask the Minister to make child care a priority during the remainder of his term of office and to address the two main concerns I have outlined today. The first of these is the number of social workers who deal with proposed adoptive parents and the second the age limit at which a woman can adopt a child.I take this opportunity to wish all adoptive parents well. Adoption is a difficult but very worthwhile process. The Labour Party will support this Bill which gives parents every assistance and encouragement. I hope the proposals the Minister of State Deputy Brian Lenihan, is considering will be accepted to give adoptive parents even more support.

Its provisions will significantly extend the duration of adoptive leave by two weeks to a total of six weeks' statutory adoptive leave entitlement attracting payment. Such leave will allow an adoptive mother and child to bond at a vital time in the latter's young life just as a natural mother bonds with her child during his or her early days.Psychologists contend that the baby-mother bond is a key one which has important indicators for future life. As the components for the development of a happy, healthy, independent adult are formed at an early stage, it is important that adoptive mothers be given the same opportunity to bond as a natural mother. According to psychologists, better bonding leads to more natural mothering, which is what the process under discussion is about. Experts and casual travellers alike have remarked that in more primitive cultures one never sees babies crying. A peace corps worker who was in Africa in the 1960s recalled that in a marketplace not one of the 50 babies present and tied to his or her mother's back with a knotted shawl was crying. We have a great deal to learn from such cultures about the mother-child bond. Paediatricians and psychologists agree that where children enjoy a close, interactive relationship with their parents over an extended period, they appear to be more balanced and satisfied generally.The forerunner of this Bill was the report of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. It was a landmark report as far as adoptive parents were concerned. The improvements in adoptive leave provisions are being synchronised with the maternity leave provisions contained in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, which is only right. The Adoptive Leave Bill should mirror the 2004 Act as adoptive mothers and their children find themselves in similar circumstances to their counterparts. The same demands are placed on them and children have the same needs in terms of feeding and waking times. A child has a package of needs whether he or she is the child of an adoptive or a natural mother and we should strive to ensure equality in the legislation.In times past, grandparents were available to educate young mothers in the care of children. That luxury no longer exists as grandparents are now likely to be much younger and in the workforce. It should be recognised in legislation that young mothers must learn the necessary skills on their own. The decision to implement in full the working group's recommendations heralded a new deal for adoptive parents. It is not that long ago since the rights of adoptive parents to any leave was a mere pipe dream. The injustice of the situation was quickly corrected following completion of the working group's deliberations.Prior to 1995 an anomaly existed whereby adoptive mothers were denied the same leave entitlements as in maternity cases. The 1995 Act was the first real step to correct that anomaly. The correction of the anomaly in the treatment of natural and adoptive parents is a matter of simple justice and is to be commended. The adoption process involves a considerable amount of emotional stress, with adoptive parents being in a vulnerable state at a difficult time. Adoptive parents suffer the same stresses as natural parents in terms of worrying whether they will cope and how the new baby will take to them.Parents planning to adopt require counselling and support as many who choose to adopt do so from different standpoints and at different times. There are many issues involved in the process which is often viewed by parents as a nightmare in terms of the hurdles put in their way, such as interviews to determine suitability and so on. The many issues they have to address cause a great deal of stress, but they have to deal with the situation.The Bill provides support for the stability of many Irish families. It further facilitates the adoption process by entitling parents to increased paid leave in connection with the adoption procedure. The Bill also facilitates a much greater retention of women in the workplace and contributes to a greater gender balance there as well as making a positive contribution to improvements in their quality of life.Parents proposing to adopt from foreign countries require time off work to visit the country concerned and that raises issues such as security of employment. We must safeguard the employment of those who go the extra mile to ensure they can start a family. Parents may be required to spend protracted periods abroad meeting families and negotiating with foreign Government officials for two to three months before returning to Ireland with a child. The adoptive parents are also totally immersed in the customs and cultures of the country of the child's birth. The provision entitling adoptive parents to attend reparation classes and pre-adoption meetings with social workers and health board personnel without loss of pay is to be welcomed. While a natural mother requires a considerable amount of time off work to attend clinics, adoptive parents often need greater time off given their requirement to meet health board officials while going through the screening process.Lack of child care programmes remains a serious problem. The Minister for Finance may be in a position when delivering the forthcoming budget to loosen the purse strings and introduce a child care payment or income tax relief for child care. Adoptive parents may be expected to pay for expensive crèche or child care facilities for the newly adopted child and, in many cases, this provides a disincentive for one partner to remain in the workplace. Child care tax allowances such as those provided in the United States or a special child care payment would enable parents to remain in the workplace.The Bill represents a significant advance in providing for labour rights for prospective adoptive parents but we continue to play catch-up in comparison with some of our EU and non-EU counterparts. The legislation goes a considerable distance towards reconciling the imbalance which existed not merely between adoptive and natural parents but between adoptive mothers and fathers in terms of less equal or discriminatory treatment in the manner of the adoption.

I note it follows the recommendations made by the working group and in that regard improves maternity protection legislation.I have not had a chance to compare and contrast what is offered by the legislation and what is available abroad. I have briefly examined similar entitlements in the UK. It appears we are not going as far as the UK in certain instances. For instance, in the UK adoptive parents are entitled to two periods of 26 weeks to be taken as the parents wish. While I did not examine the issue in great detail I believe we should try to at least be equal to the UK in that regard and should perhaps look further afield at Scandinavia and go a little further towards meeting what is available there.I was struck by the references in the Bill to gender which, it appears, stems from the principal legislation which places strong emphasis on the different roles of mother and father. I accept that may be the case in terms of the mother giving birth but when considering adoptive parents we should perhaps remove the references to gender as it may well be that the father is the primary carer. We should anticipate that likelihood and should gender-proof the legislation to allow either parent to take on that responsibility. We should also look ahead to a day when we need not consider gender as two men or two women seek to adopt a child. The legislation should anticipate such a situation.I welcome the two-week increase in adoptive leave entitlements. The provision allowing employees to attend pre-adoption meetings makes a great deal of sense, particularly given that more than half the adoptions in Ireland are of children from abroad, with which comes enormous requirements to travel, language difficulties and financial issues. The picture on the front page of a newspaper earlier this week of the Taoiseach with five mothers with newly adopted Vietnamese children illustrates how important is the need to cater for those adopting from abroad. I can only imagine the Taoiseach was feeling a little broody following the taking of that picture given the charming faces of children and parents beaming into the camera.

Some 336 adoptions in 2002 were of children from abroad, a very high figure. We must ensure we cater for the often onerous issues that arise when one is adopting from abroad. As a couple must adjust to a baby coming into their lives through natural birth, so too must adoptive parents. Very often it is a more difficult time for adoptive parents. Adopted children often have stronger emotional needs, something which should be reflected in the legislation. It can take adopted children a long time to adapt to their parents. Parents need time to get to know the child and to allow the child to adjust to its new life. The Green Party welcomes the main provisions of the Bill.I would like to digress for a moment to speak about the onus on Irish society to become more child friendly. We need to look to all Departments and to work out whether we are creating an environment which is conducive to family life and the life of children. It appears that in planning of new residential estates we are planning more for the motor car than the child. There are good models abroad, in Germany and the Netherlands, where streets, towns and communities revolve around the needs of children. The streets are safe for them to play on. Play areas are provided and that stops children going near the road. How other countries look at the needs of children in society should give us food for thought. While I have not been to Scandinavia for some years, I remember there were pocket parks in almost every neighbourhood within which there appeared to be child care centres. These parks were located within walking distance of where the people lived. That is not happening in new or existing communities in Ireland.Within the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown council area there are only six playgrounds operated by the local authority, while in some counties there is none. That is an indictment of our failure to cater for the needs of children in the wider arena and should give us pause for thought. While the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 goes a long distance towards meeting the needs of adopted children and their parents, we should look at the wider issue of making society cater for the needs of children. Those needs are not catered for if parents are looking at their watch as they drive their children to the play group or crèche before hurrying back into the traffic and coming back after dark to pick them up. Something is wrong there. We must change Irish society and put the needs of children first when planning policy.Slightly more leave is allowed abroad. English legislation gives more time to adoptive parents and we should examine that model. We might also play down the gender references in the legislation. There is every possibility that the male would wish to be the primary carer and that should be encouraged in the legislation.It is important that we get the early years right. This Bill is a step in the right direction and I hope we see more Government policies that put the needs of children first.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	251	My view that this Bill came before the House as a crumb from the IBEC table to the unions was strengthened by the casual approach of the Ministers involved. Earlier today the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was ten minutes late for a committee meeting. I fully understand why he was late, given affairs in Roscommon and the issues of an urgent nature he has to deal with. At least when he came before the committee he gave a good account of himself, even if he admitted that the terms of the Bill could not be changed much because it was a done deal between parties outside this House, the social partners. He could not, therefore, make changes even if we had pressed him hard. That emphasises my view that this House acts as a rubber stamp on deals that have been done elsewhere. There are limited opportunities to make changes. I do not know if the Minister of State had the same difficulties in Roscommon as the Minister and I hope that the earlier suspension was not as a result of difficulties elsewhere.I welcome the introduction of this Bill, which brings existing adoptive leave provisions into line with the provisions contained in the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act that was passed earlier this year, applying the recommendations of the report of the working group on the review and improvement of maternity protection legislation. That is some title. There will be no time delay in implementing this Bill despite the time lapse between the adoption of the earlier Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act and this Bill. The Minister clarified that this afternoon and I was delighted to hear that is the case.This legislation is similar in nature so I feel obliged to repeat a number of points I made during the previous debate, particularly on the barriers to women who would like to combine motherhood with work. It goes without saying that adoptive mothers should receive the same level of pay entitlements as natural mothers. Adoptive leave, like parental leave and maternity protection, is at the forefront of the battle to bring about a better work-life balance for workers. I take this opportunity to question why the Bill to amend the Parental Leave Act is not due for publication until next year. That is unfortunate.In terms of length of leave and statutory maternity benefit, we fall behind in comparison to other EU states. Sinn Féin believes we can learn much about maternity, adoptive and parental leave from the Nordic countries, where leave entitlements allow for babies to be looked after by their parents or a parent for the first full year of life. I reiterate the call I made during the debate on the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill for entitlements in this State to be increased to 26 paid weeks and 26 unpaid weeks leave to enable the new mother, adoptive or natural, to care for her baby during that crucial first year.Sinn Féin does not believe the maternity leave provided in this legislation is adequate, welcome though it is. We call for the total period of leave to be increased to 26 weeks to allow for a greater period of leave after adoption. This is absolutely necessary given the difficulties with child minding faced by working mothers. If we do not facilitate such an increase in adoptive and maternity leave we will end up forcing working mothers to leave employment altogether. Ireland ranks bottom of the list alongside Greece and Luxembourg in terms of statutory maternity paid leave and maternity leave in an international global analysis of employment conditions and benefits in 60 countries published in 2003.It is important to highlight the downright scandalous position of this State on paternity leave. It is incredible in this day and age that there is no legal entitlement to paternity leave, paid or unpaid. It is no surprise then that Ireland ranks bottom of the list in paternity leave. Most countries in the EU offer paid paternity leave, from two days in Spain to two weeks in France, while new fathers are entitled to a full four weeks in Norway. Fathers north of the Border, on the same island, just up the road, are entitled to two weeks paternity leave, yet there is no entitlement in this State. I ask the Minister of State in summing up to outline when legislation on paternity leave will be introduced. It is a linked issue and is particularly important. It should be introduced as a matter of urgency if the Government is to make progress towards the goal of achieving work-life balance. Is it the case that paternity leave is not being introduced because IBEC is opposed to it? Does it hold a veto in this area? That appears to be the case.The quality of life for working parents with small children is severely affected by the lack of affordable child care. Parents are faced with the stark choice of losing one income if one parent stays at home with the child or struggling to find a place for the child in an expensive crèche. The OECD Thematic Review of Early Childhood Education and Care Policy in Ireland — these bodies insist on long titles — published in July, found that access to accredited development programmes for children from birth to three years old in this State is very weak despite the fact that the development of quality child care is self-financing through increased tax returns from women's work and less dependency on social security. It recommended the extension of funded parental leave to one year following the birth of a child and suggested that in many countries individualised care of infants and the planned return of women to the labour force can be achieved most effectively through this policy.Much needs to be done to remove the barriers to low and middle income families accessing child care, which remains scarce and overpriced. The OECD further criticised this State for the standard of access to early education for children aged three to six years and called for publicly-funded education for all three year olds. Until recommendations such as those made by the OECD are implemented, it will remain a constant struggle for mothers and fathers to combine work and parenthood. In particular, the principle that the best interests of infants under 12 months old are served where they remain in the direct care of their parents did not guide the Government in the drafting of this legislation or the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act. This was an opportunity to facilitate mothers and fathers to care for their children in the first year of a child's life.As I stated in my contribution on the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act, this Bill offers very little. Without significant advances in the provision of affordable child care, more women will leave the workforce either because no child care places are available or because what is available is simply too expensive. Good quality child care must be made available to all, especially to those on low incomes. A universal entitlement to free pre-school must be introduced. The progress on child care to date from this Government has been miserable and is blatantly not a priority.It is disappointing that this Bill delivers little for women seeking to combine motherhood with work. Its provisions are minimal and do not seek to make any real difference to the lives of working women. If this State and this Government is to develop real opportunities for the many thousands of women who earnestly wish to return to the workplace, those opportunities need to be facilitated through many of the measures I have commended to the House.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I welcome this legislation which amends the Adoptive Leave Act 1995. This legislation came about following the recommendations of the working group established for the purpose of amending that Bill. The Adoptive Leave Act 1995 provided additional weeks' leave to adoptive parents at the time. Child care, adoption and children in general have been priorities for this Government in recent years. The needs of adoptive parents are being recognised in this legislation.The main purpose of maternity leave was not solely to provide the mother with time to recover from childbirth; it was also to allow the mother and child time together to bond, to get to know one another and to allow them to enjoy this period without concern about paid work outside the home. An adoptive mother also needs time to bond and get to know and to love her new child. It therefore makes sense that adoptive parents have the same rights to leave so that they can become accustomed to being parents. It is also essential for a child to get used to his or her new home and establish the security that is so important for the development of every child.Many parents and parents-to-be will welcome this Bill. It is important that parents are supported as they go through the adoption process and this must be reflected in legislation. We should not differentiate between natural and adoptive parents. Parents who were not in a position to have their own children have gained a great sense of fulfilment from being able to adopt children. It almost seems outrageous that anyone would suggest that adoptive parents should not be entitled to the exact same rights as natural parents. They are, after all, embarking on the same undertaking to nurture and love a new addition to their family, blood related or not.Many parents who eventually adopt probably go through an emotionally difficult time. Some partners who are unable to bear children may decide to adopt. Others may decide to adopt from an early stage. By and large, people who adopt do so after a number of years of marriage and undergo an emotional upheaval in making a decision of this nature.Adoption is deserving of support and recognition and the Bill provides these. I welcome the fact that prospective adoptive parents will be entitled to time to attend pre-adoption meetings and classes. It is essential that parents are prepared for the process and for their future role as adoptive parents. A child's interests are first and foremost in the adoption process and it is essential that future parents are well prepared to care for them.It is to be welcomed that single mothers are keeping their babies. Inter-country adoptions now make up the bulk of adoptions which take place in this country. We must move with the times and do everything in our power to assist adoptive parents in their quest to adopt a child overseas. We have all seen the sad images of unwanted children abroad. It is a travesty that while these children are alone with nobody to hold them or show then any sign of affection, wonderful loving people in Ireland are desperate to adopt a child. It is essential that we do everything possible to assist these people in adopting a child who would otherwise have a loveless childhood and possibly a sad young life. Adoption Board statistics for 2002 show that of the 602 adoptions authorised that year, 336 were foreign adoptions, 99 were Irish non-family adoptions and the remaining 167 were adoptions within families. Classes are being provided to familiarise people with the culture of the country where the adopted child was born, and this legislation will assist future parents in attending these classes.I also welcome the vital employment protections provided in the Bill. Adoptive leave will be considered as a period of service and that is an important provision. An essential element of the Bill is that it will prevent termination of employment.The birth of a child requires considerable advance preparation and adjustment and this is also the case when a child is being adopted. The adoption process is a long and often worrisome experience for parents but happily, in most cases, the process is well worth the wait. Many parents finally fulfil their dream of having a child to love and cherish. The adoption process is meticulous and demands the full commitment of adoptive parents. Those wishing to adopt must be given every support throughout this period.More than 50% of adoptions in 2002 were foreign adoptions. I am acquainted with many parents, as are many Members of the House, who are in the process of undertaking a foreign adoption. It is not an easy process. I understand why the adoption process must be rigorous but there may be excessive red tape on some occasions. The interests of the adoptive child must be foremost but recognition should be given to the needs and requirements of the adoptive parents, especially in the case of foreign adoptions. Sympathetic interviews carried out by all concerned, such as social workers, are a great help to the adoptive parents. I know of parents who speak highly of the support they received from social workers at that vulnerable time.However, I have also been approached by potential adoptive parents who did not find their contacts with the adoption services to be as good or caring as they should have been. This is especially the case in a small percentage of foreign adoptions. It may be that there is nothing we can do in this House, but I ask the Minister to keep this area under review.The Adoptive Leave Bill will enhance the existing legislative provisions for employed adopting parents and will offer them greater employment protection and more flexibility in managing their work and family responsibilities during this important period. I commend the Bill to the House.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	253	This is minor legislation. It seems strange that the Government always wants to hang on to its little piece of inequality and discrimination, no matter how minor the legislation. I do not understand why adoptive parents cannot be given 18 weeks' paid maternity leave in the same way as a natural mother. One of the arguments made is that a pregnant woman needs to rest for two weeks prior to giving birth and two extra weeks are granted to allow for incorrect dates.As Dr. Devins will understand, the process of adopting a child, whether within this country or from abroad, is tortuous. There are numerous meetings with social workers and a meeting in one's own house. One must obtain a passport and deal with many foreign embassies to arrange to travel to many of these countries, yet we persist with this discrimination. If there are approximately 1,600 adoptions per annum and the maximum payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs is €172 per week, that amounts to €500,000 per year. There is no reason for this under the Unfair Dismissals Act or under the Adoptive Leave Act, yet it is included in the legislation. The only redeeming feature of the legislation is contained in section 3 which provides that the Minister may by order made with the consent of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Finance extend the period of leave. Practically the same words are repeated in section 5 which provides for the adoptive father to receive the extended maternity leave in the event of anything happening to the adoptive mother. The Minister of State should give a commitment now rather than wait to have it changed at a later date. He should give a commitment in the House, or outside as usually happens these days, that he will extend the leave to 18 weeks for both natural and adoptive parents. Those adopting a child should receive more time off before the child is placed in the household because there are so many more difficulties.The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is undertaking a wide-ranging review of the adoption laws and issues relating to adoption here. I hope he shows a more enlightened approach than that shown in this legislation.Adoption has changed dramatically in recent years. Few adoptions come from within the country as the vast majority of single mothers keep their children. Therefore, many of those who require an adoption must go abroad to get that child. They adopt children from countries which, by their nature, are deprived. We are aware of issues regarding China, Vietnam, Romania and other eastern bloc countries. In the past, the issue of adoption was unregulated except that it could be treated almost like a commodities market. Wealthy western people with no children travelled to these countries to meet dubious state agencies for the purpose of adopting a child. This involved an enormous cost to the agency abroad as well as the costs incurred by the parents in numerous flights to and from these countries and having to remain there for a week or two, yet this is something we do not take into account. That still happens. They must spend a significant period in the adoptive country. All this should be taken into account in the Bill. Given that we are not giving these parents extra time to fly abroad, the least we could do is give adoptive parents the same rights as natural parents who are fortunate enough to have a child of their own to rear.Changes in society mean that both parents work and deliberately decide to postpone having a family to an age where many mothers' fertility decreases quite dramatically. Fertility can drop by up to 50% to 60% from the age of 25 to 35. There will be many more couples who have postponed having a family and who will realise they have fertility problems, that IVF will not work and that the only way they can have a family is by adoption. Let us get rid of this discrimination from the beginning and let us hope when the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, reviews the legislation, he will make it easier for parents to go abroad to adopt a child. They experience enough difficulties abroad without our stacking obstacles against them.Most of the meetings with social workers who view the home are beneficial and are for the purpose of protecting the child. It is not that the State is interfering. The State is good in that respect in that it watches its duty to the child. We need to be more careful in putting through this legislation.Adoption is a difficult and emotional subject. It was certainly an emotional subject from my point of view as a general practitioner when a husband and wife who were trying to adopt came to my surgery having failed to have a family. It is quite distressing for a husband and wife when they realise, having gone through all the tests and investigations, that they will not have a family of their own. Even at that stage, thousands of euro can be spent on expensive IVF treatments. When it comes to deciding to adopt a child abroad, they are in the dark concerning the problems they will incur before they can get that child home. I am in favour of much of what is set out in the Bill because it is for the protection of the child. While the child's circumstances and the country from which he or she comes may be disastrous — we all saw some of the children who came from orphanages in Romania — the conditions may not be much better in parts of China, and possibly Vietnam, although I do not wish to castigate these countries without having an enlightened child care policy. While the circumstances from which the child comes and goes to here are vastly different, we must look after those children.Not all these are wealthy middle class parents with plenty of money to go abroad and adopt a child. Many who fail to have a family are not wealthy and do not have the money to throw around to adopt a child. We should examine ways to make life easier for these parents.On the issue of maternity cover, 18 weeks' paid maternity leave is provided for plus an additional eight weeks without pay. This means a mother is entitled to a maximum of 26 weeks to bond with the child in any one year. Four weeks must be taken before the child is expected to be born and the remaining 22 weeks may be taken afterwards. There are major difficulties with a mother bonding with an adopted child. While the mother loves the child, there is an issue of bonding because the child is usually eight or nine months old. We should try to be more enlightened. There is no need to extend the paid maternity leave but there is a strong case to be made for it being more open-ended in respect of non-paid maternity leave. That incurs no cost to the State and so far as employers are concerned, they can recruit contract workers and need not concern themselves about employment law unless they must retain that person for longer than 12 months. If a husband and wife are fortunate enough to adopt a child from a foreign country such as Estonia, Latvia, some of the children may have been affected by the Chernobyl fallout, may have their own problems and may require a number of admissions to hospital or visits to a special unit until the problem is sorted. It would be good for us to be more understanding in this regard and perhaps make unpaid paternity leave more available to the parents involved.I am sure the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will liaise with the Departments of Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this issue. They should carefully examine how we treat parents, especially those who have adopted children from overseas, because there may be complications when the bond between the child and the adoptive mother is not as strong as that with the natural mother. Such parents need time and space to develop a relationship with their children. However, if they are stuck in a rut worrying about how many weeks they have left, we will cause problems for ourselves.Why should mothers alone be so tied to the full 26 weeks of maternity leave? Some parents, including our own, returned to work much sooner than after 18 weeks because that was the nature of their lifestyles at the time. Even now there are many mothers who would like to return to the workforce earlier but do not do so because they must look after very young babies. It may also be the case that a mother is self-employed and her husband may be an employee. Although some may think that a mother giving her husband the opportunity to take her maternity leave is a means of exploiting the system, it is not necessarily the case.Self-employed people have their own difficulties in trying to keep their businesses going because they do not have the protection of paid employment. Therefore, if a mother were self-employed and felt the need to go back to work to protect her livelihood and business which supports her family, why should her husband not be able to avail of her remaining maternity leave, whether that is three, four or six weeks? It is not paternity leave but rather a continuation of the maternity or adoptive leave of the other parent which can be used to continue looking after the child.We have come a long way in that we now believe fathers as well as mothers can look after their children. To extend the provision of maternity leave beyond the mother alone would be a progression of that belief. There is no reason it could not be made available to the father, although not straight away since mothers would usually like to take a minimum amount of time with their children. However, now that extended maternity leave is available, the option should be made available to fathers. Some people have been critical of the amount of maternity leave granted in Ireland, but I hope we never end up like the United States where mothers enjoy just six weeks' paid leave. It is not as easy to get unpaid leave there as it is to get eight weeks' unpaid leave in Ireland.This Bill is a tiny aspect of the review of the adoptive laws and child care Acts that the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is working on but it offers the opportunity to examine the other issues I have outlined. We need to get rid of the discrimination. The 18 weeks' leave should be available to both parents. If anything, we should examine how adoptive parents can recover some of their costs if they have spent long periods abroad. Both parents should also have the opportunity to take up maternity leave cover. It need not necessarily be the mother.I was surprised to learn of the 16 weeks versus 18 weeks figures. A constituent wrote to me about it and I thought it crazy at the time, especially so when one considers the amount of money involved. If the option is available to the Minister of State, he can make a statement that, along with the Ministers for Social and Family Affairs and Finance, both of whom should be easy to get through to on this issue, he will extend the period to 18 weeks for both parents. We can then plan on what we should do with the rest of the adoption laws.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	254	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I will not discuss the difficulties others have experienced. However, I wish to raise an issue which has been brought to my attention by adopted people, namely, the availability of counselling and assistance when they are introduced to their natural parents. I spoke to a man who had successfully traced his natural mother and was introduced to her with the State's assistance. However, he was left at that stage and no assistance or advice was available to either party to guide them through the difficulties and trauma they experienced. He said it was a difficult time for natural parents and adopted children alike. The man sought help, assistance and advice during the period. Although his case had a successful outcome, he was emotional about the needs of adopted people when they seek to identify and develop a relationship with their natural parents.He was strongly in favour of some assistance or counselling being made available by people experienced in the area who understand the process a person goes through when they are first introduced to their natural parents, when they begin to explore different aspects of their lives and when the relationship develops. This is because it is natural that difficulties will arise between two people with different experiences who are linked together biologically.My response was that there are many areas in need of counselling services, of which this is one. The area is neglected by the State and the relevant Departments. To be fair, it may not be the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which deals with this but rather the Department of Health and Children. However, this is a real live human issue which arises for many children, especially those who were adopted ten, 15, 20, 30 or 40 years ago and go on to meet their natural families. The numbers will probably decline because there is more openness between natural families and adoptive parents and their children. I know of families which have adopted abroad and have periodically taken the adopted children back to their natural parents to maintain some bond with them.Adopted people beginning to research their natural parents should be trained to deal with the difficulties they will experience just by virtue of the fact of their making a decision to go to the State authorities to seek such information. There is also a difficulty in tracing people. I know a person who went to Dublin to trace his mother only to be informed that the mother had not consented and the name was not available. When the person went to the agency in Mallow he got the name and the mother was anxious to meet him. The point is that he went to an agency in Dublin which gave him information that the mother was not available, yet when he went to another agency, she was. There needs to be an examination of the co-ordination of information in that area. I would like to raise that issue at a later stage with the relevant section of the Department.I recognise that it may not be an issue for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but I would like to use the opportunity to raise this important issue. Some adoptees feel that the person dealing with them should be adopted and that only an adopted person can understand the feelings and the emotions of an adoptee researching his or her natural mother and then meeting them and developing a relationship with them. They have spoken about having a support group of people who are adopted and have gone through that who would help others through it. Perhaps there is a way of making some information available. I do not have an answer to this. Perhaps we could have a counselling service that has researched, experienced and understands the various stages an adopted person takes from the time that he or she decides to research, meet and develop a relationship with his or her natural mother. Difficulties are experienced in that, both for the adopted person and the biological mother. I have not extended that to the difficulties for adoptive parents.From my understanding, when a relationship develops with the natural mother and comes to an understanding and a good relationship, the adopted child identifies with the parents who adopted them because of the natural bonding that took place over the years. The relationship and bonding that existed will always put the adoptive parents first in terms of how an adopted person relates to both adoptive and natural parents. People are in need of help in this area. The Department of Health and Children should examine that and reply to us so that we can inform adopted people of the assistance the State can give to such people.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the Bill and for the positive response to it. I will attempt to deal with the questions raised.Having been Minister of State with responsibility for children for a period of almost three years, I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by the Deputies on the issues which are wider than what is covered by this legislation today. The current Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is bringing proposals before Government in the autumn to deal with many of the issues raised, including the last issue raised by Deputy Neville. I concur with the sentiments expressed. It is an area where one experiences much emotion by people. The support given in times gone by was perhaps not as good as it should have been, but it has improved considerably and I acknowledge that there is a need for further improvement. When I became Minister of State with responsibility for children, it was not possible to adopt from China or Romania or several other countries. It is good to see that there has been significant improvement since then.In answer to Deputy Moynihan-Cronin's question on the number of adoptions, the total number has increased. In 2002, there were 602 adoptions, of which 336 were foreign adoptions. In 2003 there were 621, of which 385 were foreign adoptions. It is good to see an improvement. One of the saddest things is to see parents who are desperate to adopt and who, for a variety of reasons, cannot adopt or are delayed by the investigations that must take place. Any improvement is good.I appreciate the point made by Deputy English and Deputy Moynihan-Cronin on the delay in bringing in the Bill. In fairness to the Government and to my Department, this owes more to the delays in drafting legislation because of the workload of the Parliamentary Counsel. There is also a difficulty of getting time to introduce legislation to the Oireachtas. While it has taken some time, it is good to see that the Bill is before the House.The Government has a good record in implementing its legislative commitments in the equality area. In 2004, we have had two important pieces of legislation, namely, the Equality Act 2004, which transposed three EU directives, and the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004. The Equality Act had an immediate effect and three sets of regulations have been finalised to allow for the commencement of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act next Monday, 18 October.Deputy English suggested increasing the duration of adoptive leave to equal maternity leave. Section 3 of the Adoptive Leave Bill 2004 provides for a further increase of two weeks in adoptive leave to 16 weeks, as approved by the Government last October. The increase in adoptive leave linked the proposed reduction of the compulsory pre-confinement period of maternity leave. It effectively means that once the legislation is enacted, both natural and adopting mothers will be able to avail of 16 weeks' leave with payment of benefit from the Department of Social and Family Affairs from the time a child is born or placed into their care. Deputy Twomey referred to the issue of 16 versus 18 weeks, but there are a further eight weeks of unpaid leave and a further 14 weeks' unpaid parental leave. Further leave can be arranged with the employer. I think it is important to remember that the basis of this legislation was agreed under the social partnership process. It is important that we take the partnership approach to these issues, that the social partners are involved in these negotiations and that the proposals they devise are considered by the House and the Government.We must try to agree to the recommendation of the maternity review group. These recommendations were arrived at following negotiations and compromise with the social partners. They should also be agreed in respect of adoptive leave. For us to depart in any significant way by giving additional rights to employees at employers' expense would be considered to be a breach of the partnership process. I am cognisant of that. Consequently, I am slow to accept some of the suggestions that have been made here today which would break the principle of partnership negotiation.Deputy English and others raised the question of sharing the leave entitlement between adoptive parents. I understand that in the context of the consultation with the former members of the maternity working group on the amendment of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995, consideration was given to a proposal to allow adopting mothers to share their adoptive leave entitlement with their partners. However, the proposal was rejected as it would have constituted a significant departure from the Adoptive Leave Act 1995, the stated purpose of which is to redress the perceived anomaly that women who adopt children were excluded from existing maternity arrangements and to replicate all the relevant benefits of maternity for women whose motherhood arises from adoption.Deputy English also raised the question of provisions in the event of an adoption falling through. If that were to happen, section 12 of the 1995 Act deals with that. The same applies in this regard as applies under the 1995 Act.In terms of the rights of a person adopting or the rights of person who has adopted a number of times, the rights in the legislation are available for each adoption. They are not forfeited by circumstances such as those raised by Deputy English.The lack of information on adoption and maternity entitlements was raised by Deputy English and referred to by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. The Equality Authority is tasked with providing members of the public with information on their entitlements. This is supported by information provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and organisations such as IBEC and ICTU have provided considerable information and material on work-life balance measures. This information is also provided to employers and employees. I am satisfied that there exists a considerable volume of information on entitlements available. If there are any areas Deputies want to bring to our attention, we will certainly consider them.On the question of dispute resolution, sections 30 to 40 of the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 establish redress procedures in the event of a dispute relating to entitlements under the Act. A dispute referred to a rights commissioner must be submitted in writing and made within six months of the issues arising. In 2002, there were 20 such maternity cases referred to a rights commissioner and already this year seven maternity cases have been referred. Either party to a dispute may appeal the rights commissioner's decision to the Employment Appeals Tribunal once the appeal is lodged with the tribunal within four weeks of the decision being issued. Thereafter, either party may appeal from the tribunal to the High Court on a point of law.The shortage of social workers and the issue of age limits was raised by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin. These issues were strongly articulated during the consultation process on the adoption legislation earlier this year which was conducted by the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The outcome of the consultation process is under active consideration in the Department of Health and Children. I expect the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will bring new legislative proposals to Government in the coming months. I will bring the concerns expressed by a number of Deputies in this regard to the attention of the Minister of State. Points raised by a number of speakers fall within the remit of that legislation rather than the adoption legislation being put through the House.On the issues raised by Deputy Cuffe and the comparison he made between the situation here and that in the United Kingdom, in the Irish case there are a number of forces pushing the limits on statutory employment rights. There is EU legislation which imposes certain duties on the State to enhance employment rights. We have a good record on implementing EU requirements and often the scope of our legislation goes beyond the minimum EU requirements.We have a model of social partnership that I believe the British would love to have. It has served us well in terms of creating all the conditions for employment growth in the economy. It has facilitated major increases in the number of people at work. The review of all the maternity legislation was carried out in a partnership process involving all the social partners. All the improvements agreed in this regard during the review were implemented in the Maternity (Amendment) Act 2004. This legislation brings those improvements into effect for employed adopting parents.It is important for me, as Minister of State, and the Department to be cognisant of the negotiations that took place between the social partners and the agreements reached. I do not agree with the sentiment expressed by one Deputy that we should ignore the social partners and do what we want in this House. We have been well served by social partnership. This legislation reflects the agreement made in that social partnership process.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Deputy Twomey raised the issue of a mother and father sharing their maternity leave entitlement. The maternity leave Act implements the EU pregnant workers directive 1992. This directive does not permit the mother to transfer a portion of her maternity leave to the father of their child. The father has an individual statutory right to parental leave of 14 weeks which may be taken at any time from the time the child is born up to the age of five. It is not a simple matter to make the change Deputy Twomey suggested because many such issues are governed by EU directives, as in the case of this specific issue.An important point was made in respect of the process for adopted children making contact with their natural parents. That issue will be dealt with in a comprehensive way by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, in the legislation he is about to bring before the House.Child care provision was referred to by a number of Deputies. When I was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, the provision for child care was extremely poor. It has improved significantly. A total of €449 million is being spent on child care provision. Some €220 million is being allocated to private and community based child care providers. It is estimated that this will create 30,500 new child care places and will support more than 27,900 existing places on the completion of those projects. Some €43 million has been allocated towards quality improvement measures which include supports for the national voluntary child care organisations and the establishment of 33 city and county child care committees. While I accept the fair point made by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin that there is a continuous need for additional resources to be allocated to child care provision, with which no one could argue, it must be acknowledged that the increase in expenditure as a result of the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-2006 has been significant and it is making a significant contribution.

the failure to provide adequate nurses for the Mayo dialysis unit; capital funding for Ballinrobe community nursing unit; development of Tuam Hospital; and the health care facility at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel;—the failure of the Government to invest in the development of new parallel services before contemplating the withdrawal of existing medical services; and—the failure of the Government to extend to the rest of the health services the model already existing in general practice, i.e. delivery of a same day and same place GP service, with equal access for public and private patients;calls on the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to state her position on:—equality of access to the health service based on need and not on ability to pay;—whether she intends to implement the Hanly report in view of the absence of public support, and no alternative services being available;—the financial threshold for qualification for a medical card to be increased so that the 200,000 extra medical cards promised can be delivered;—the urgent provision of 1,000 extra hospital beds — with full supporting staff;—the Government to urgently address the overcrowding situation in our accident and emergency departments;—strategy to address the disgraceful outpatient waiting list situation;—the proper funding of the primary care strategy as promised;—adequate access to radiotherapy services for those outside of the Cork and Dublin areas;—the immediate establishment of an inter-hospital helicopter emergency medical service, HEMS, for Ireland;—the full development of oncology services in our hospitals;—the immediate appointment of consultants to include consultant rheumatologists and other necessary consultants to address the gross shortage existing presently;—the extension of cervical screening nationally;—the extension of the BreastCheck programme to the south and west of Ireland;—a guarantee that all citizens be within a 20 mile radius of the nearest ambulance station and that adequate ambulances are available; and—the full development of Ennis Hospital as promised; adequate nurse staffing for the Mayo dialysis unit; capital funding for the Ballinrobe community nursing unit; the opening of the completed health care facilities at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel; and approve the planning brief for Tuam Hospital;and calls on the Minister to provide funding immediately to allow these projects to proceed.

She uttered fine words but, as we all know, addressing the problems in the health service requires more than words. It requires action. The performance of this Government and its predecessors highlights the problem that the failures identified in this motion have not been addressed.The Minister spoke well but then stated she would implement the Hanly report recommendations. I have said from day one that the report is a dead duck. It should carry a health warning because it will really only satisfy the centralising bureaucrats. People will not be able to get to accident and emergency units because of the greater distances they will have to travel to central services.There is apartheid in the cancer care system and the Cancer Care Alliance was set up to address it. BreastCheck was organised by the alliance. A march was held and within 48 hours it was announced that BreastCheck would be extended, yet we are still awaiting this extension. Sixty-five people die in the south and west every year because BreastCheck was introduced for only half the population. Therefore, the health apartheid continues and some 260 people have died needlessly, including sisters, mothers and nieces.The Tánaiste referred to the treatment purchase fund. What good is this to the 100,000 people on the unofficial waiting list who are waiting to get on to the official one? Such people include men with prostate cancer who have been waiting for months for an appointment and who still have not got one and those who must wait six years for an appointment with a urology specialist. We have fewer rheumatologists per 100,000 of the population than Croatia and Russia and we have the lowest number of consultant rheumatologists in Europe.It is not acceptable that a man with cancer must be made wait. Children are whistling when they talk because they do not qualify for orthodontic treatment. Some have to purchase such treatment using money they do not have. It is either this or whistle for life.The problems in Ballinrobe date from 1971. The number one priority, a community nursing unit for the elderly, has still not been provided. A sum of €400,000, a small amount, is required to enable the project to proceed to tender stage.Despite the fact that there is a dialysis unit in Mayo General Hospital, seven people, including older people and wheelchair users, have to travel to Galway three times per week to use dialysis services. This involves a round trip of 1,000 miles per week to survive. Their whole lives rotate around travelling to Galway.A report on a helicopter emergency medical service was commissioned in 2002 and was not published until 2004, giving one an idea of what the Government feels about this issue. Some days ago an ambulance had to travel from Dublin to Galway at 30 mph to avoid potholes as the person it was carrying had a very serious back injury. It is disgraceful that this person should have had his life risked by travelling in this onerous way. Helicopter emergency medical services are available in every other country. Some €16 million was spent entertaining EU Ministers during the six months of Ireland's EU Presidency and €52 million was spent on electronic voting, yet €16 million was not made available for helicopter emergency medical services.The Western Health Board area is unique in that it has ambulance bases that are not within the recommended 20 miles of the population, thereby putting lives in jeopardy. It is disgraceful that people on the minimum wage still do not qualify for a medical card. Some 200,000 medical cards were promised yet 100,000 have been removed from the system. What about the sad, silent migration of old people into institutions? A defined Revenue funding scheme would certainly sort this out, as well as being good value for money.There will be no end to the accident and emergency crisis until such time as the Government provides an adequate number of beds. The system is inadequate and as a result the crisis is continuing. It is not acceptable for the Government to sit on its hands and allow this situation to continue. Every one of us is anxious to do what we can to support any Minister, but no matter what a Minister may say or do, it is a question of delivering, and the Government has not delivered on this matter.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	264	There are two fundamental issues involving the health service, first, the two-tier nature of the system where access is based on ability to pay and not on medical needs and, second, inadequate funding. There is much evidence to prove that ability to pay is the determinant for access to facilities. I recently heard of a case involving a person awaiting an orthopaedic procedure, who was told that he would have to wait from eight to 12 months for an outpatient appointment. That person asked his general practitioner to refer him to a private consultant. As a result, he received an outpatient appointment within a week and the procedure was completed within ten days. That is the type of service available under the two-tier system, whereby if one has the money one will be looked after but if one does not, one will be on a long waiting list.The second difficulty involves inadequate funding. Today's report by the ESRI states that Ireland is second last when it comes to health funding. Of the 22 countries surveyed, Ireland spends 7.3% of gross domestic product on health compared to an average of 9% for the other countries. That is a serious difficulty which has arisen.Another matter identified in the ESRI report is that low-income families are not able to access GP services because they simply do not have the money to do so. Because it costs too much to pay for general practitioner services and medication there has been a huge fall-off in people attending their GPs, particularly those at the cut-off limit for medical cards. The Government promised an extra 200,000 medical cards yet not only do we not have them, but there are also 100,000 fewer medical cards now than in 1997.I want to provide a flavour of what the eligibility limits are for medical cards. A single person on social welfare of €134.80 per week will not qualify for a medical card. A married couple aged between 65 and 69, whose sole income is from unemployment assistance or benefit, will not qualify for a medial card. A married couple aged between 65 and 69 whose sole income is from a contributory or non-contributory old age pension will not qualify either.The Minister should immediately grant an extra 200,000 medical cards by making the eligibility limit at least the same as the minimum wage. I would prefer to see free access to GP services for all, although I know the new Minister will not do that. She should at least increase the eligibility limits so as to include everybody on the minimum wage.For some time, facilities have been completed at Our Lady's Hospital in Cashel, including an Alzheimer's unit, a physical disability unit and two psychiatric units, which are all vacant. Funds should be made available to open these units immediately. I hope we will not have to take to the streets, as we did in Clonmel, to make these units available to the public of south Tipperary.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	265	How can the Government stand over the millions of euro that have been squandered in the name of health over the past seven years? When will the Government stand up and take notice of what is happening to ordinary people when they enter the health service? Hospitals are going backwards instead of forwards. The shortage of doctors and nurses, particularly at weekends, is adding serious stress and trauma to patients and medical staff alike. When will the Government listen to the doctors and nurses who are trying to carry out their duties under atrocious and depressing conditions? This situation cannot continue. It needs to be addressed immediately. It is unfair to expect one or two doctors to cover an entire hospital at weekends.There is a two-tier health service in this country. If one can afford to pay for treatment one will get it instantly, but the outcome for those on medical cards is not so good. Waiting lists for services are on the increase and people wait well over 12 months for treatment that they have a right to receive. We should examine other countries that have successful health services and must not be afraid to adopt their best practices.The new Minister for Health and Children needs to adopt a common sense approach. She must be prepared to tackle the bureaucracy, examine critical staffing levels in each hospital and ensure that money is spent on patient care, thus fulfilling the Government's promises. What measures does the Minister intend to put in place to counteract the crisis caused by the MRSA super-bug, which is now rampant in Irish hospitals?Will the Minister inform us when the 1,000 extra beds promised by the Government will be delivered? When will the extra medical cards be provided? Will the Minister admit that the Hanley report will never be implemented in full because it is impossible to implement something that would further degrade the health service? The list of such questions continues and every time health issues are raised the list becomes longer.There have been enough empty promises. I challenge the Government, particularly the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to sort out the overcrowding of our accident and emergency units, to tackle vigorously outpatient waiting lists so they will be eliminated, provide an air ambulance service for citizens living in rural areas, develop oncology services in hospitals throughout the country and fulfil the promises made.The people of Clare want to know when Ennis General Hospital will be upgraded. I will keep asking these questions each time health issues are raised in the House in an effort to put forward the views of the people of Clare and, indeed, other counties. It is time for the Government to provide answers. There should be no more empty promises.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I thank my Independent colleagues for this timely debate, particularly in light of the ESRI study which has so trenchantly criticised the health service. We wish the new Minister for Health and Children well in tackling the challenges she faces. However, notwithstanding her fine words about the heath service being accessible to every citizen regardless of wealth, she has a number of fears to allay. One of the issues behind this motion is whether the Minister meant to say that the health service should be accessible to every citizen regardless of geography. That is an issue about which every Member of the House regularly receives representations, particularly with regard to the lack of progress in providing radiotherapy services and funding for designated oncology units for regional cancer centres. This issue is in my mind because last week I lost an uncle to cancer. He happened to be living within walking distance, if he could have walked, of the Mater Hospital. As such, the issue of radiotherapy was not one about which he had to worry, although because he was so ill he chose not to avail of the treatment.Having visited Waterford and other areas around the country, however, I understand the trauma and pain involved for many people who must travel to Dublin hospitals for radiotherapy. It is something that no Government can ignore. I hope this debate will provoke action to provide extra radiotherapy services. Currently, enormous suffering is caused due to the inequitable nature of the service throughout the country.There is an additional fear based on the Minister's appointment, given that while she is the Leader of the Progressive Democrats Party, many of the areas affected by the Hanly report are not represented by Progressive Democrats Deputies or Senators.I spoke tonight to people in Ennis who fear that, whatever about the former Minister, Deputy Martin, having local representatives in the area, the Minister, Deputy Harney, may need to act swiftly to reassure local communities who have invested a considerable amount of time and money getting a professional critique for the Hanly proposals. They want assurance from the Minister that she will give due consideration to these proposals and meet with the people who are seeking to have the professional critique presented to Government. It is exasperating that €20 million was earmarked for hospitals such as Ennis Hospital over a ten year period and each time questions are asked about where the money is, there is talk about a design phase or another phase and that the money is on the way. This indicates a lack of commitment to providing the service.Areas like Balbriggan in north County Dublin, where the population has grown from 10,000 to more than 30,000, has no out-of-hours service. Ultimately, we are dealing with a country in which health has become a by-word for absolute exasperation, frustration and suffering. While the Government gives assurances in words, we need action, which we are not getting at present. There is not even an approach being taken which will ensure there is a healthier society.The former Minister, Deputy Martin, let the cat out of the bag when he was on the rack over waiting lists. He said he can do little about it if people are getting sicker and there is more demand on the health services such as they are. This indicates the need to examine the Green Party's health proposals, which are about preventative as well as curative solutions. Money is not being spent on preventatives measures. Billions of euro are being spent annually on new drugs and medical technologies while very little is being spent on basic medicines, even hospital infection control, which would save a much greater number of lives than the drug applications. There is need for a holistic health service. When I look at the track record of the Minister, Deputy Harney, I see someone who has espoused market forces as the solution to almost everything. The health service is certainly an example of where market forces have not made us healthier. They have, in fact, made us sicker and we are becoming a very obese nation. Obesity gives rise to diabetes, heart disease, cancer and so many other health problems, and an examination of what is becoming an obeseogenic environment should be at the heart of our health strategy. All I see currently is panic to try to come to terms with promises made at election time but which have been broken. We need a health strategy which will ensure healthy people rather than just treating sickness.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I commend the Members of the Technical Group for tabling this timely motion. It is timely not just in terms of the changing Cabinet, which sees the Tánaiste take over the Department of Health and Children, but because an ESRI seminar was today presented with a paper which compares the Irish health service to other economically developed countries. To be told by a think-tank, which is well respected in this country, that we are rated 21 out of 22 health services in such countries is a shame and should be an embarrassment to the Government. The Tánaiste has the comfort of knowing that she is beginning her term of office as Minister for Health and Children in the knowledge that, as far as the Irish health service is concerned, it is closer to Boston than Berlin. The only country which has a lower rating is the United States, where almost half the population has no health insurance and where the name of the game in terms of receiving any health care is the size of one's wallet. This is the direction in which the Government has been going for the past seven years and I fear the Tánaiste will lead us further in that direction.If we are looking for a metaphor for the state of the Irish health service in 2004, we should look at a "Six-one" news report last week about the ambulance service on Aranmore Island. Aranmore Island was my father's native home where he had a fatal attack and died four years ago — I referred to it in the House in the past. At the time the ambulance was out of order and my father's last few hours were spent in the back of a trailer before being taken to a lifeboat and then to Letterkenny. As I explained to the Minister's predecessor and the CEO of the North Western Health Board, I do not think it was a factor, but it certainly did not lead to the dignity which should be afforded on such an occasion. When I saw last week's news, I discovered that four years on the same ambulance is now out of commission for one year. I saw the dilapidation of the vehicle, with a 1992 registration, which is nothing more than a rusted hulk, with nothing in its interior to justify calling it an ambulance. I saw the Irish health service represented as it truly is, and this is the morass the Tánaiste must seek to tackle.Another note that struck me in this Breast Cancer Awareness Month and the series of advertisements being run on radio and television to encourage women to be more aware of the scourge of breast cancer is the rider "breast check is not available in the south and west of the country". What kind of Government can promote such a partial service which ignores the needs of so many of its citizens?What really worries me is that in taking up her new office and saying all the right things in terms of what she thinks people want from the health service, the Tánaiste is coming into office with several pieces of baggage vis-à-vis the way in which her party has affected how the health service is run. We recently saw the opening of a private hospital in Galway. It was the first hospital to benefit from the tax incentive in the 2003 budget. Those who invested in such a hospital are getting from taxpayers tax relief of 42%. I read that most of the custom of that hospital — it is custom because it is being run on a profit basis — will come directly from State sources by the State transferring patients who should otherwise be treated in a public hospital system through the national treatment fund. This is privatisation on the double because it includes tax relief, plus the State paying for the privilege of treating its citizens without having a properly funded public health system. What sort of madness has brought about these types of policies?I am sorry the Tánaiste is not here to respond to the debate. I hope she will do so over the course of tomorrow evening. This is no white horse affair, it is rescuing a health service which has been downtrodden for several decades. We do not have a health service. We have bits and pieces where people have to make do. Their health and the quality of the health care they receive subsequently depends on who they are, where they live and the resources they have. Until the Government and the Minister are prepared to address these central questions, I fear we will not reach the ranking of the countries listed one, two and three on the list supplied today by the ESRI. I also fear that a subsequent report will rank us below the United States, in 22nd place.

Molaimid na Teachtaí Neamhspleácha as an rún a chuir os comhair na Dála, atá oiriúnach mar tá Aire nua sa phost. Is mór an trua nach bhfuil an tAire sa Teach, ach an tAire Stáit. The Sinn Féin Deputies will support this motion, even though I am disappointed the Independent Deputies highlighted the case for some hospitals but failed to mention Monaghan General Hospital, which is a glaring omission.The Government's amendment is insulting. It makes no effort to address even the main issues raised in the motion and repeats the two-part mantra that we have heard ad nauseam of increased spending and the Government’s health strategy. It has been amazing to listen to the commentary since the appointment of the new Minister for Health and Children, the leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney. One would think the Government’s health strategy had only been published last week instead of three years ago. Will the former Minister, Deputy Martin, be air-brushed out of history?A prime example is the speculation that the new Minister might be the one to take on the consultants. The consultants' contract was supposed to have been renegotiated two years ago under the Government's health strategy. In the section entitled Acute Hospital Services, the strategy promises that "greater equity for public patients will be sought in a revised contract for hospital consultants". The target date for agreement on that revised contract was the end of 2002. Last year the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, told me that only preliminary talks had begun. The new Minister, Deputy Harney, is aware that even those preliminary talks are, to all intents and purposes, postponed indefinitely. The consultants have doggedly refused to proceed until the insurance cover dispute is resolved. The consultants' position is unquestionably an obstructionist tactic.The Minister, Deputy Martin, described the consultants as kings in their own domain. This was a very strong statement but the words have not been matched by actions. We have not heard the Government's position in the negotiations. It should at least demand that all new consultant posts be entirely in the public system, as recommended in the Brennan report. There must be real accountability from consultants for work in the public system. If the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are not prepared to do this and to weather the storm, there can be no real health reform — I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is present, accepts that.As the motion states, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has stated that she wants "a health service that is accessible to every citizen, regardless of their wealth". If that is the case, we need to hear the Government's plan for ending the two-tier apartheid system whereby wealth buys access to what can only be regarded as excellent private care while the public system and the public patient are lagging way behind. The Progressive Democrats Party was nearly as extravagant as Fianna Fáil in its pre-election promises although it did not promise 200,000 extra medical cards. It pledged, however, to "ensure income eligibility criteria would at least keep pace with movements in incomes". That has not happened. Some 100,000 fewer people have medical cards than was the case in 1997 when this relationship was first launched.The Progressive Democrats also made a commitment to "ensure regional cancer care centres are established so that patients do not have to travel 100 miles for ongoing radiotherapy". It declared: "This will be an immediate priority for us." The Tánaiste must fulfil that promise and she will have the support of all opinion if she earnestly pursues and delivers on that. She should ensure that promise will mean not only that the additional centres that have been signalled will be established but also all the others that have been argued for, in Waterford, Limerick, Letterkenny and so on. She should not neglect, as many others have failed to mention, the needs of the north east, north of Dublin and to the Border, which is repeatedly forgotten by many commentators.I tabled a series of questions on this issue before notice of this week's Private Members' business was given. I am sorry the Ceann Comhairle has vacated the chair, but he disallowed most of my questions although, inconsistently, he allowed others, including one in another Deputy's name, which also addressed cancer services. My questions were specific and did not anticipate the Private Members' business of the Independent Deputies, of which I had no knowledge. I regret that most of my questions were disallowed this week.Before he left office, the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, met personnel in the North Eastern Health Board and issued a public statement about hospital services in Counties Monaghan and Cavan. I tabled a question asking the Minister to confirm that statement and the promised measures, and to put a timescale on their delivery. On the basis of the answer I received, I can only conclude that much of what the former Minister announced is already unravelling. The Minister, Deputy Martin, promised a CT scan for Monaghan General Hospital but the new Minister makes no mention of it in her reply. Is it still on the agenda? The Minister, Deputy Martin, spoke of the immediate recruitment of five junior doctors for the same hospital but the new Minister simply states that the board proposes to recruit these five doctors to facilitate the early restoration of around-the-clock medical cover. The Minister, Deputy Martin, spoke of an emergency room to be provided at a cost of €1 million. A week later, the new Minister speaks of a treatment room — there is a difference — with Government funding of €750,000.

There is more information being pulled in and pulled back, it is an incredible vista. In her reply, the Minister conspicuously avoids the part of my question which asks for a timescale for the delivery of these facilities. That is at the kernel of the whole matter. We simply do not know when services will be delivered. There has been a change of Ministers — we are delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is still here, taking the flak for those who should be in this Chamber addressing these issues directly — and the new Minister is getting off to a bad start by following the example of the Minister, Deputy Martin, in failing to come before the House for Private Members' business and answer the solid charges made by the Independent Deputies and those who support their motion. Whatever about the change of Ministers, there has been little change in terms of the need for vigilance by communities.

We will work to address the issue.The Government is committed to implementing fundamental reform in the health service. The essential elements of that programme are improved patient care, better organisation and improved delivery. I accept that some of the points made by Independent Deputies are well made and constructive.The reform programme will progress in tandem with further investment in our health services. Evidence of this is the recent announcement of the additional €85 million allocated for the opening of new facilities in hospitals. These facilities include: new accident and emergency departments at Cork University Hospital, Naas General Hospital and Roscommon County Hospital; a new surgical block, an intensive care unit, operating theatres and an accident and emergency department at James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown; two new operating theatres at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, two at Limerick Regional Hospital and at South Tipperary Hospital, Clonmel, for which Deputy Healy has called many times——

There is real hope for patients and families. The Government's focus is to ensure that there is access to services that deliver this experience for each and every person who is diagnosed with cancer. There is no doubt that this is a major challenge to our health services and a major disease, with 20,000 people diagnosed with cancer each year between 1994 and 2000. It is also a major cause of mortality and premature mortality, accounting for one quarter of all deaths. The burden that cancer places on the health services is reflected in the fact that there were almost 81,000 hospital discharges and more than 48,000 day cases with a diagnosis of cancer in 2002.The report on the development of radiation oncology services was published in October 2003. Government has accepted its recommendations and has agreed that we now require a major programme to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. The first phase of the programme will be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The development of these centres is of critical importance and will, in the shortest possible time frame, begin to address the profound deficit in radiation oncology services identified in the report.There has been significant progress in implementing the report's recommendations. There has been approval for the appointment of more than 130 additional staff and full-year current funding of approximately €15 million provided to open the new radiation oncology department in University College Hospital, Galway and to expand capacity at Cork University Hospital. This will enable the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists, for whom recruitment is under way.In developing this model, radiation oncology centres will be required to provide services on an equitable basis that will ensure that patients of equal need will have equal access. Geography will not be a barrier to equal access. Radiation oncology centres at major teaching hospitals will be required to provide outreach services to hospitals in adjoining regions as is currently the case. As more consultant radiation oncologists are appointed, it will be necessary to ensure that there is an equitable spread of outreach services.The Government has decided that in the future development of services, consideration should be given to developing satellite centres at Waterford, Limerick and the north west.

Representatives have met to progress the design process, the next stage in the process.The cervical screening programme was introduced on a phased basis, with phase one commencing in the Mid-Western Health Board area in October 2000. Under this phase, approximately 74,000 women in the 25 to 60 year age group are being screened free of charge at minimum intervals of five years. To date, almost 45,000 women have availed of the screening programme. The motion refers to the failure of the Government to extend the mid-west pilot project on cervical screening on a national basis. It is prudent to evaluate an initial pilot phase in any programme before considering its extension.

#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	343	It is important to put in context the provision of acute hospital services. There have been many important advances in surgical technology, including less invasive surgical methods and advances in anaesthetics. These advances have allowed the range, safety and effectiveness of surgical procedures to be enhanced to a greater extent. However, innovations and technological advances have led to increases in the demand for surgical procedures, especially elective procedures.Activity in our acute hospitals continues to increase. The number of patients discharged from hospital having been treated as either inpatient or day cases in 2003 was more than 1 million. This is the first time the number has exceeded 1 million. This represents a 5% increase over 2002 and an almost 30% increase in the number of patients treated compared to 1997. The increase in acute hospital activity is a direct result of the Government's investment in capacity and staffing.The Government's aim is to clearly focus on reducing waiting times for public patients who require admission to hospital for elective treatment. The national treatment purchase fund was established to help to achieve this aim. The fund's task is to achieve reductions in waiting times and, particularly, to offer treatment to those who have been waiting longest. The NTPF was set up on a statutory basis on 18 May 2004 and has made significant progress in the meantime. The fund has undertaken validation of those waiting longest for treatment and has taken account of factors such as patients not available for treatment, patients not medically suitable to undergo treatment, patients no longer requiring treatment and patients postponing treatment at their own request.

Therefore, 80% of patients wait less than one year for surgical treatment. This represents a major reduction in the time patients must wait.The fund has substantial capacity to treat patients and will continue to focus on reducing waiting times even further. The fund's target is to treat more than 12,000 this year — it has the capacity to treat a minimum of 1,000 patients per month. This will allow the fund to make further significant progress in reducing the average waiting times for surgical procedures. Since it commenced operations, the fund has been successful in locating additional capacity and arranging treatments for more than 19,000 public patients up to the end of September 2004.

Comhairle na nOspidéal published a report on accident and emergency services in February 2002, which noted that a hospital-wide response was needed to meet the requirements of the emergency service. Delivery of the emergency service at hospital level is interdependent on the inpatient elective service and day and outpatient care. The effective delivery of emergency services, therefore, cannot be dealt with in isolation from the delivery of all hospital-based services.Many of the difficulties and delays experienced in emergency medicine or accident and emergency departments reflect system-wide issues such as the demand experienced by each hospital, the resources available to it, as well as the structure, organisation and staffing profile of the hospital. It is necessary, therefore, to take a whole-system approach involving primary care, acute care and sub-acute and community care to tackle the problems in emergency medicine departments.A number of initiatives are under way to address pressures in emergency medicine departments. Improved and expanded emergency medicine departments are being provided through national development plan funding in many acute hospitals. For example, new departments have been provided at Cork University Hospital, James Connolly Memorial Hospital, Naas General Hospital, South Tipperary General Hospital, and Clonmel and Roscommon General Hospitals. New departments are also under construction at St. James's Hospital and Tullamore General Hospital. The establishment of minor injuries units, chest pain clinics and medical assessment units will also improve the operation of emergency medicine departments.The Department has approved Eastern Regional Health Authority proposals for a range of short and medium-term solutions to the problems associated with emergency departments in the Dublin academic teaching hospitals. The cost of these new initiatives is €2.4 million in a full year. Areas covered include the appointment of specialist nurses, the establishment of rapid assessment clinics and the provision of multidisciplinary teams to assess patients.

There are 51 emergency medicine consultant posts in acute hospitals, which is a 260% increase in numbers since 1997. The availability of senior medical staff in emergency medicine departments should facilitate rapid clinical decision making and enhanced management, diagnosis and treatment of patients.Pressures on the hospital system, particularly in the eastern region, arise from demands on emergency departments and difficulties associated with patients who no longer require acute treatment but are still dependent. Full year funding of €8.8 million was provided to the ERHA in 2003-04 to facilitate the discharge of 280 patients, mainly elderly, to more appropriate settings. An additional €5 million was provided in June 2004 to facilitate the transfer of a further 200 patients, including young chronic disabled people. The Department provided €3 million to the ERHA to transfer a further 120 patients in August 2004.My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Belfast commissioned a feasibility study and report on the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service for the island of Ireland. The decision to commission the study was made on foot of a recommendation by a cross-Border working group on pre-hospital emergency care. The group is one of a number established under the North-South Ministerial Council to examine cross-Border co-operation in the health area. The report of the consultants appointed to undertake the study was published on 30 April 2004 and is available on my Department's website.Possible roles for a helicopter emergency medical service identified in the report include primary and inter-hospital response. Primary response involves travelling directly to the scene of an incident to take a patient directly to hospital whereas inter-hospital response is the planned, rapid transfer between hospitals of patients who require specialist care under the escort of skilled professionals. The report concluded that an inter-hospital transfer service would be more appropriate in an all-island context. According to the consultants, the provision of such a service with a single helicopter would involve significant capital investment costs of €12 million and annual operating costs of €4 million. Additional helicopters could be added with an additional annual cost per aircraft of over €3 million.

Key elements of the process would include the recruitment and training of appropriately skilled staff, development and implementation of education awareness programmes, the procurement of aircraft and the identification, development and certification of landing sites. According to the report, the timescale for completion of this wide range of activities would be approximately three years from the date of a decision to proceed. My Department is exploring options on the development of a helicopter service in light of the recent study, as part of which exercise it has initiated discussions with the Departments of Defence and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. A meeting is scheduled to finalise an air ambulance service level agreement between my Department and the Department of Defence.A more immediate priority in the area of pre-hospital emergency care is the development of the ground ambulance service. Funding provided by my Department in recent years has facilitated significant advances in the development of the ambulance service. Among the developments have been a major upgrading in training and standards, the equipping of emergency ambulances with defibrillators and the training of ambulance personnel in their use, the introduction of two-person crews and improvements in communications equipment and control operations. Principal among the developments currently being addressed are the elimination of on-call as a means of providing emergency cover, improved fleet reliability and the roll-out of the advanced paramedic training programme.The elimination of on-call is designed to facilitate further improvements in response times. My Department is providing funding in excess of €4.3 million in the current year to facilitate the continued phasing out of on-call in a number of regions. This is a programme which I hope to be in a position to extend. My Department provided additional capital funding of €2.5 million in December 2003 and a further €4.9 million in the current year to enable health authorities to continue with the fleet and equipment replacement programmes which are essential pre-requisites for enhanced, speedy and appropriate care. In addition, the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, announced policy approval for the development of the advanced paramedic training programme and considerable work has been done to prepare the legislative base necessary to give it effect.I am pleased to advise that the new statutory instrument amending the pre-hospital emergency care council's establishment order was recently amended to facilitate the introduction of the training programme. The programme's introduction also requires the amendment of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1988 and the Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control) Regulations 1996 and the necessary legislative changes are being progressed as a priority by my Department. The combined amendments will provide a statutory basis for the administration of additional medications, such as cardiac medications, and it is intended that the expanded service will commence roll-out in 2005 following the completion of training of ambulance personnel.Emergency care and related services have been the subject of significant departmental and management attention and investment. The Government will continue to focus on the delivery of emergency services to provide high-quality care and ensure that patient access and treatment remains at the centre of health policy.

I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute on behalf of Fine Gael.The Ministers of State, Deputies Tim O'Malley and Brian Lenihan, must be extremely concerned at the confirmation today of the Opposition contention over a number of years that the health services fare badly when considered in a global context. Our service compares poorly to 22 national health systems according to a survey published by the Economic and Social Research Institute today. In fact, the Irish health system came last and second last in two of the three categories examined. The Republic rated joint last with Japan in terms of non-medical factors, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, road traffic injuries and immunisation rates, of which the Government has made great play since entering office. Ireland ranked just above the United States of America in second last position in terms of outcome in rates of heart attack, cancer and suicide. The Republic's performance on life expectancy at birth for men and women was in the bottom third of countries. These are key criteria by which the success or otherwise of a health system is examined.Ireland is the lowest spender alongside Finland in terms of financial resources devoted to health across the 22 countries examined. We devote just 7.3% of our GDP to health spending compared with an average of 9% across the 22 states. We hear constantly that we are spending more and more and both Ministers of State present this evening said as much again. We have been shown internationally to be the lowest spender of 22 states examined by the ESRI.The drop in medical card numbers is one of the key issues which has been raised recently. Members of the Opposition have been recalling that while 200,000 medical cards were promised almost two and a half years ago, 101,000 fewer people are covered by the medical card scheme than when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition was elected. Approximately 37% of the population had medical cards in 1997, a proportion which has been reduced to 28%.The people most affected are those on incomes marginally above the level at which they would be entitled to a medical card. They cannot afford doctors fees and access to basic medical care. General practitioner care is becoming unaffordable for a significant minority of people on the margins of eligibility and they are suffering great hardship. People on the margins are now presenting late in illness and neglect chronic problems because they cannot afford the cost of accessing early a medical doctor. The absence of a medical card is particularly problematic for people with chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. Failure to treat such problems could result in serious difficulties later, such as heart disease, kidney failure and stroke. The Government is penny-pinching and will pay later when these diseases, which could have been prevented with early intervention, arise.The medical card scheme was introduced to provide care for those on low incomes. The vast majority of medical card holders today are those on social welfare, those aged 70 years and over, those suffering chronic illnesses and those who qualify under exceptional circumstances. It is my experience that fewer people are now eligible under the chronic illness criteria. It is as though a message has gone out to the health boards to clamp down in this area.The Minister of State referred to the issue of over-crowding in accident and emergency departments. There is an urgent need to deal with this issue as we enter a period of climate change with many elderly people and others likely to present with symptoms of influenza. We should not have to seek to deal, under Standing Order 38 or by way of Adjournment debate, with matters such as people being treated in the back of ambulances or hospital yards, or awaiting treatment for days in emergency departments. Something by which the new Minister for Health and Children will be judged this winter will be the number of issues, such as people awaiting treatment in emergencies, raised by way of Adjournment debates or under Standing Order 38.The Minister of State spoke at length about the reduction in waiting lists. However, he did not refer to those awaiting placement on waiting lists. Many people are awaiting consultations which will enable them to get on to waiting lists. I was approached by a person two weeks ago who has been waiting for four years for an ENT consultation following which he will be placed on a waiting list. The Minister of State may boast that he will receive surgery within 12 months. That may be true, but he will have had to wait four and a half or five years for that intervention. The Minister should, in an effort to be open and transparent on this issue, speak of those awaiting placement on waiting lists.While I welcome the motion, it does not refer to mental health, an issue which I raised with the Independent Deputies. I am disappointed the Minister of State did not speak of mental health as an issue in terms of the general health service. I am also disappointed the Minister did not address that issue. However, I am hopeful that, as a member of the Progressive Democrats holds the senior Ministry in this area, the Government will respond favourably in terms of the availability of resources for the mental health system.Some 11% of the total health budget was devoted to mental health when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government took office. That figure now stands at 6.7%. It is not unfair to ask the Government, on behalf of the 25% of the population who at some stage will suffer a mental illness, those who suffer in hospitals or from trying to access them and those who suffer because members of their families have taken their lives as a result of the lack of proper treatment in the mental health area, to restore the mental health budget to that which obtained when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government took office in 1997. It is only then that the Minister will have a base from which to work in improving the situation. I could be emotive and critical on this issue but I implore the Minister to seriously examine the mental health area.I hope the new Minister for Health and Children will respond positively to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, as a member of her party, in addressing that issue. I again welcome the debate and congratulate the Independent Deputies on tabling this motion.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I also welcome the Minister's initial comments in terms of what she proposes to do in the future. I would like to address the North Eastern Health Board area. It is interesting that of the €85 million recently allocated not one penny was allocated to the North Eastern Health Board region, an area along the Border which is supposed to benefit from Government, international and peace initiatives. I question the Government's commitment to the Border region when it makes no effort to assist it when it has money to spend.The population of the North Eastern Health Board region has increased by 12.7% since 1996, the highest population increase in the country. From 1971 to 2002 the population increased by 40.7%, beaten only by the Dublin health board area. There has also been an increase of more than 1,000 in those aged 85 years and over. Care of the elderly is therefore significant in that region. Last but by no means least, the region has the largest number of asylum seekers per capita than any other part of the country. Providing for such a population costs money, yet the North Eastern Health Board area was left €42.5 million short in the last budget. While that shortfall was based on historical reasons, if one bases it on actual statistics the region was left short €130 million. While I often criticise the activities of the North Eastern Health Board, one has to remember that without money it cannot provide services.The average per capita allocated to the North Eastern Health Board region for 2004 is €1,591 — the national average is €2,018 and in the Dublin health board area it is €2,362, leaving the North Eastern Health Board region short on average €427 per capita. We also have the lowest ratio of staff per patient. While I criticise the administrative staff level in the area, one has to take into account those figures produced independently. At least 300 extra beds are needed in the region, yet we have been promised only ten day beds at Monaghan General Hospital with money allocated and 19 extra beds in Cavan General Hospital with no money allocated.I apologise if I was emotional when the Minister of State, Deputy O'Malley, was making his contribution. However, I have very good reasons for acting that way. The Minister of State spoke of the reduction in the number of people on waiting lists. As my colleague, Deputy Neville, said, the Minister of State did not refer to those awaiting placement on waiting lists. I asked the previous Minister, Deputy Martin, what it costs to send a person and his or her spouse to Birmingham or elsewhere in the UK for treatment under the national treatment purchase fund when the particular treatment could be undertaken in Monaghan General Hospital were it not taken off call. The theatre and staff at that hospital remain idle. I do not suggest the national treatment purchase fund is not a good scheme, but surely we should utilise what we have before spending such money.We need somebody to oversee how money is spent, an issue which brings me to speak of the Cavan-Monaghan region that I represent. I am somewhat amazed by the motion tabled by the Independent group. I support it in principle but I cannot believe the hospitals of Cavan and Monaghan have been left out of it and that it has been signed by my Independent constituency colleague, Deputy Connolly. Cavan and Monaghan have had the most serious problems in the country, highlighted in the news and by the Independent Members of this House, but facilities in Ballinrobe, Tuam and across the country are mentioned here with no mention of the need for an upgrade for Monaghan Hospital.In case anyone thinks everything is all right there, I refer to the fact that the previous Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, issued a statement at the eleventh hour in which he thanked Deputy Connolly for being constructive. The bottom line is that the previous Minister can make a statement but the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, tells us the facts. She told us in no uncertain terms that there will be no CAT scanner and that only limited money is available. Above all she tells us that Cavan General Hospital, as part of the configuration of services, will have the possibility of 19 beds examined. This is a serious situation. There is a crisis in the north east that could be solved in the morning if the initiatives were put in place to allow Monaghan General Hospital to reopen. I welcome the discussions between the health board and the consultants to bring about a level of agreement but this package must be delivered.The Government promised to provide 200,000 additional medical cards but took away 100,000 in seven years. Of the 100,000 medical cards that have been taken away, 6,035 were in County Monaghan, which has a population of 50,000, while in the former Minister for Health and Children's constituency in Cork, 8,000 were taken from a population of 500,000. Why have I had to raise the issue of medical cards so often in this House? It is ludicrous, mean and unacceptable.

I acknowledge this is a promise but there is not much point in me asking for a second promise. I have been involved in negotiations since May 2003 at senior political, administrative and professional level and I am convinced that the contents of this package will be delivered. That is why I was elected. The announcement of a 24 hour a day, seven days a week unit at Monaghan General Hospital is what the people of Monaghan want. They want a CAT scanner, services and junior doctors. That package will be delivered and I thank Deputy Martin for delivering it. Be it at the eleventh or any other hour, I am glad the commitment was made.I will be here to see the package is delivered and I have nailed my colours to the mast in saying it will come. On my first day in Dáil Éireann my call was for the retention of an on-call accident and emergency service at Monaghan General Hospital and for the provision of a CAT scanner. I have a commitment on that and I expect it will stand. There are difficulties with timeframes but it is a challenge for me to ensure the package is delivered. If the CAT scanner is left out of a speech or an answer, it is my job to ask the questions and to remind the new Minister, whom I wish well, to deliver it. This will remove the vagueness.The major concern of the people in Monaghan, Ennis or Nenagh is the accident and emergency service. The new Minister and the Government must find a way to deliver that service to the people. People have no problem with centres of excellence, they will travel for a hip operation or heart surgery, but they want a facility nearby in an emergency where they can be stabilised after a head injury or receive anti-thrombolic medication within the critical 20 minute period following a heart attack. If one then needs to go further so be it. The accident and emergency service is vital. In the national spatial strategy we talked about hub towns and gateways and a hospital is a key facility in each town. It makes it easier to attract industry and ensure it stays.I agree with Deputy Neville's comments on mental health services. We must pump extra funding into that area. We talk about mental health services and suicide, wring our hands and leave it at that. Money is needed. We have a new way to deliver mental health services, they are more home-based and cost effective and I ask the Minister to take on board the appeals for extra funding.

The grand plan for radiotherapy services and cancer treatment services across the country will need at least another three years before anything happens. We have already been waiting for them for two years. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, focused on oncology, saying that investment in the national cancer strategy has amounted to €559 million since 1997. That works out at €70 million per year, less than 1% of the health budget, but the Government boasts about such a small amount of money. It might look like a lot when it is added up but we know from dealing with cancer patients there is a pathetic service that needs much greater investment before we see any improvements. The radiotherapy report is sitting in the Department of Health and Children gathering dust. The Government comes in here and talks about what will happen and what will be done but we will see another Government implement it at this rate.Pressure on the hospital system, particularly in the eastern region, arises from demands on emergency departments and difficulties associated with patients who no longer require acute treatment but who are still dependent. My consultant used to say that to me when I was working in the Meath and Adelaide Hospitals in 1993. Why did the Government not deal with this issue? It has been in Government for seven years, with major health budgets. It knows the problem in accident and emergency departments is a result of the running down of primary care. As a result more people use the accident and emergency service because they cannot get a GP leading to long stay patients taking up beds. Nothing has been done to correct that.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the House. While I have nothing against my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, I hoped to see the new Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment replying to this matter tonight. It is a very important matter to do with the five RAPID areas of Limerick City that are the most deprived parts of the city, as the Minister of State will be well aware, and the threat to the job initiative positions in those five areas, namely, Moyross, Southill, St. Mary's, Our Lady of Lourdes and St. Munchin's. Approximately 200 people stand to lose their jobs within the next five to six months as a result.These communities are very deprived and unfortunately are frequently cited in the media because of various problems but they have a wonderful community spirit and the job initiative workers particularly, do invaluable work. It is community sabotage if these jobs are allowed to go.The work includes maintenance of green areas in the estates and running crèches for children. In Moyross, the work includes monitoring cameras, which is of assistance to the Garda. Some of the workers have given evidence in murder trials. They provide meals for elderly people. There is support for the schools in the form of well-known sports people coaching the children and literacy classes and a wide variety of activities are organised in these communities.I cannot understand how a Government that is now saying it will try to lift all boats, is caring and sharing and concerned about the marginalised, can allow this to happen. The Minister of State will be aware that the time frame for addressing this issue is very short. The communities have been informed they must cut the overall numbers on job initiative by either two or three in each community and people have already been put on notice in that regard. The other issue is that people who have been on the scheme for more than three years have been informed they must go within six months, probably five months from now. There are not people available who are eligible to take over these jobs in the schemes because applicants must be over 35 years and five years unemployed.We propose that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment give a year's grace in order that a sound framework can be established to set up what I describe as a community jobs scheme similar to the rural jobs scheme already in existence under the auspices of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. These community jobs are worth doing for their own sake and should not be reliant on what FÁS describes as labour market interventions. It is essential that these jobs be taken away from FÁS because its remit is not to provide support for communities but rather to provide labour market interventions that lead people on to full employment. The communities need this work; the people are doing an excellent job. These communities should not be abandoned and the work is of significant importance to them. The people involved are making great efforts to improve the lives and the environment of the community around them. I want them to be given a year's grace to allow for setting up a permanent scheme to provide for community jobs to do the work currently being undertaken by people on the job initiative scheme so that it can be continued on a sustained and long-term basis. Time is of the essence and we need a decision from Government. We require cross-departmental and sensible thinking, otherwise these communities will suffer hugely.

When reviewing the opportunities and resources offered to communities it is important to emphasise that a wide range of active labour market, training and education programmes operate across a number of Departments, aimed at improving the prospects of unemployed and inactive persons progressing to jobs in the open labour market. In addition to employment programmes there are employment subsidies such as the back to work allowance and back to work enterprise allowance, and the educational opportunities provided by the back to education allowance and the vocational training opportunities scheme. The programmes operated by FÁS under the aegis of this Department are job initiative, community employment and the social economy programme, which between them currently account for approximately 25,000 places.Job initiative is an active labour market programme aimed at those over 35 years of age who have been unemployed for the previous five years, with the primary objective of progressing these participants into the open labour market. It is specifically targeted at equipping the long-term unemployed, through identified worthwhile work and training, with the skill that will allow them to enter the labour force. Work experience is provided on a full-time basis for up to three years for participants, with flexibility for a one-year extension in specific cases where it can be shown to have a progression benefit. The allocation of places to individual projects and within regions is an administrative matter for FÁS that estimates there will be approximately 2000 participants on job initiative at year-end. There were 316 places available in the Limerick region at the beginning of the year and the projected figure for the end of the year is 284. However, when community employment places are taken into account there will be an additional 14 places provided in this region by year-end. Job initiative is a labour market programme and, as such, the concept of progression by participants is central to it. Participants must abide by the terms of their contracts and move from the programme after an agreed period of support and development. This is necessary so that vacancies will become available on a rolling basis and in order that other long-term unemployed and disadvantaged groups may have the opportunity to participate in the programme. Approximately 80% of participants on the job initiative programme in Limerick have been on the programme for four years or longer and a number have remained on the programme since it commenced in 1997.It is important to recognise that full employment is the most effective route out of poverty, disadvantage and dependency on State welfare and must remain the primary objective for participants in active labour market programmes such as job initiative. A willingness to engage in progression, whether directly into the jobs market or if appropriate into further education or training opportunities, has always been an essential part of the scheme.The proper functioning of this process would be of benefit to both the local communities within which the job initiative project is based and the country as a whole. Over the past 18 months FÁS has supported managing agents in their efforts to progress all persons who have been participating on job initiative projects for more than three years. This would apply to the participants in Limerick. These persons are being offered the high support process, customised training, main-line training and job seeking support. The high supports process is designed to provide a flexible response for persons experiencing barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment in the open labour market, and is based on the individual needs of clients with the support of a fund of up to a maximum of €2,200 per person. Where vacancies are created these are being filled on an ongoing basis by either job initiative or community employment participants. Over the past year, FÁS has endeavoured to support local communities in Limerick in the services they wish to deliver while keeping the focus of the schemes on securing jobs for participants in the open labour market.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I am grateful for the opportunity of raising the important matter of a new school at the School of the Holy Spirit, Gaol Road, Kilkenny. The Department of Education and Science designated the School of the Holy Spirit for pupils with emotional disturbance or those pupils who present with autistic spectrum disorders or ASD. Until recently the school catered for pupils in the primary-school age group but as the school is to expand, providing second level education for pupils with ASD, the pupils reaching post-primary age will in future be retained within the school.The school has six classes, operating a six to one pupil-teacher ratio. There are 32 pupils aged between five and 13 years enrolled and 24 of these pupils have a diagnosis of ASD. It has come to the notice of public representatives and the school authorities that there is insufficient accommodation at the present site to facilitate six pupils in the School of the Holy Spirit, Gaol Road, Kilkenny. This has developed into a more serious matter given that there is insufficient school accommodation to cater for the needs of the people of Kilkenny city.The development of the existing site at Holy Spirit special school, Gaol Road, was strongly supported by the Bishop of Ossory, Dr. Forristal, and the diocese. With the help of teachers, special school assistants and parents, it has developed an enormous reputation as a valued education resource for those children with disabilities.The main school building comprises four classrooms, a staff room, a dining room with a serving area and a small assembly-PE hall with some office space off it for the multidisciplinary team, a small office used as a library and the principal's office. The fifth classroom within this building is located in a small office space and currently accommodates two pupils. There are two prefabricated buildings in the school yard, one of which accommodates a class of pupils while the other is used for central processing work. The toilets are centrally located within the main school building and pupils require supervision when leaving the classrooms to use them.There have been recent difficulties regarding windows falling out of the building and repairs are proving difficult due to the presence of asbestos in the structure. However, the school building and the board of management do everything possible to ensure repairs and routine maintenance are carried out to a high standard and that the best possible facility is available to the children, notwithstanding its deterioration and location.I ask the Minister for Education and Science to ensure the great work being done by parents, teachers and special needs assistants, for the benefit of these children, is recognised in terms by sanctioning the project that has been promised by various people, though not by me, since 2000. Insufficient progress has been made to date to bring the project to construction on a new site that is now available at Callan Road, Kilkenny. I ask the Minister to ensure this project is included in the 2005 Estimates.

The school caters for pupils with special educational needs. It has an enrolment of 37 pupils and a staff of seven class teachers and 13 classroom assistants.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that a site at Seville Lodge has been purchased for the proposed building project at the Holy Spirit special school, Kilkenny. This project is at the early stages of the architectural planning process, has been assigned a band one rating by the Department and is listed in section 8 of the 2004 schools building programme.Officials in the Department are examining the current and future enrolment levels for the school in consultation with the Department's inspectorate. In this regard, the Department officials have arranged a meeting between the relevant Department personnel with a view to finalising deliberations on the matter. Further contact will be made with the school authorities when this process is complete.The Department is aware of the invaluable service provided by Holy Spirit special school, Kilkenny, in catering for the needs of pupils with special needs in the area. Every effort will be made to conclude the deliberations as soon as possible with a view to progressing this project.In regard to projects that were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 schools building programme, including the Holy Spirit special school, Kilkenny, the Department's officials are reviewing all such projects with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual schools building programme from 2005. The Minister expects to make further announcements in this regard before the end of the year.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Mr. Tim O'Malley.I have sought this debate in an attempt to move forward the position concerning Tuam health campus. The hospital in Tuam was closed on 6 April 2001. While it functioned as a hospital until the day it closed, it has not been utilised since for the delivery of health services to people in the catchment area, which comprises north-east Galway, south Mayo and west Roscommon. That was the area it serviced while it functioned as a hospital and that is the same area that is being deprived of proper health care services because it remains closed.The saga has continued for three years since the former Minister for Health and Children made money available to purchase the Grove Hospital in Tuam, which was being disposed of by the Bon Secours sisters. Unfortunately, that was the end of the action as far as the Government was concerned. Public money amounting to approximately €4 million was expended on the purchase but that asset, purchased with public money, has been allowed remain idle and deteriorate since then. That is a terrible waste of taxpayers' money.The Western Health Board has identified the need for a community hospital in Tuam and has prepared a planning brief which identifies the need for a community hospital comprising 60 beds in addition to X-ray facilities, a GP unit, day care hospital, dementia day care, mental health day care, primary care unit, an ambulance base and a regional child and family care training centre. That planning brief was submitted to the Department of Health and Children on 8 October 2002 and has been on the Minister's desk since then. During that time nothing has happened. The blame for the inaction lies at the Government's door because the Taoiseach gave a guarantee that the Government would provide a hospital in Tuam. That guarantee was underpinned by a similar assurance from the former Minister for Health and Children to the effect that a hospital would be provided in Tuam. It is now past time for those commitments to be honoured and approval to be given to the Tuam health campus project which encompasses a community hospital.Since the Western Health Board made its submission to the Minister for Health and Children the case for a hospital in Tuam has been further supported by the national spatial strategy. Under that strategy Tuam is designated as a hub town, the only town in County Galway to receive such designation. The strategy outlines the characteristics of a hub town as including a local or regional hospital. This is an example of a national strategy supporting the case for a hospital in Tuam.Over a year has passed since the strategy was published and it is time for the Government to give expression to this national policy and its associated aspirations by giving approval to the Tuam hospital project. In recent months the western regional authority published a document entitled Regional Planning Guidelines for the West Region, which identifies the need for the provision of health care services in Tuam, to service the catchment area of north-east Galway, south Mayo and west Roscommon. The case for improved health care services in Tuam was further underlined by the Western Health Board when under a pilot scheme, announced by the Minister for Health and Children regarding the delivery of primary health care, it identified two priority areas. Tuam was one of those two priority areas, the other being Erris, County Mayo. However, the Minister failed to sanction the Tuam application.In a separate study on the siting of ambulances bases in the Western Health Board region, Tuam was again identified as a priority area for the provision of an ambulance base. This application has been submitted separately to the Minister but, regrettably, the proposal has not been approved to date.I am not asking that a hospital should be provided overnight in Tuam. What I am seeking is that finance be made available immediately to commence the planning of Tuam hospital and the Tuam health campus, separate finance to be made available for the immediate establishment of the ambulance base and the construction of the primary care unit. If the Tánaiste is to pursue implementation of the Hanly report, she could do no better than develop a prototype local hospital in Tuam as envisaged in that report so that it would be clear to all what is on offer.Last February I got an undertaking from the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children that an announcement would be made in regard to the Tuam project in 12 to 14 weeks. That was four months ago and we still have no announcement. We need a timescale and we need it now.

Following the closure by the Bon Secours order of the Grove Hospital in Tuam, the Western Health Board, which is responsible for the provision of health services in the Tuam area, took a decision to build a new 50-bed community hospital on the grounds and adjoining land to replace the existing facility. This new hospital will comprise a mix of up to 30 beds for continuing care with the remaining beds made up of direct access, rehabilitation or convalescent, respite and palliative care beds. In line with what is generally provided in the board's district hospitals, the service will have a very significant mix of multidisciplinary staff, including medical, nursing, nursing support, paramedical, as well as other complementary therapists.Coupled with this, the board envisages the Tuam hospital functioning as the hub of a comprehensive outreach service, providing home care programmes, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, home nursing and home help as well as other flexible packages of care. These specialist care services will, of course, be supported by social support services such as community welfare and home advisory programmes. This project does not, therefore, envisage the re-opening of the old hospital for nursing care purposes.The Government has made services for older people a priority and is fully committed to the development of a comprehensive health service which is capable of responding quickly, fully and effectively to the health service needs of older people. In recent years, health and social services for older people have improved, both in hospitals and in the community. Since coming into office, the Government has substantially increased the level of finding, both capital and revenue, in respect of services for older people. For example, the amount of additional revenue funding increased from £10 million in 1997 to €100 million in 2003 with a further €9.5 million being allocated this year. This serves to demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to improving services for our older population.Significant capital funding for the health sector has been provided since the commencement of the NDP in 2000. Total expenditure for the years 2000 to 2003 was approximately €1.7 billion. Considerable progress has been made in addressing the historical deficits in health infrastructure and improving the standards of facilities required for quality modern patient care. The national development plan is providing considerable capital funding to services for older people. On a national basis, this will enable a comprehensive infrastructure of community nursing units and day care facilities to be put in place as well as the refurbishment of existing extended care facilities and the replacement of old workhouse-type accommodation. Older people deserve first class facilities and we intend to provide such facilities in appropriate locations.My Department is examining the health capital programme for 2004 and beyond to ascertain what new projects can be progressed through either planning or construction stages, taking account of existing commitments and overall funding resources available. It is in this context that my Department will continue to liaise with the Western Health Board regarding the proposed development in Tuam in the light of the board's overall capital funding priorities.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter which is of such serious concern to up to 2,000 householders in my constituency and in adjoining areas of Dublin South-West.On Friday last a number of householders who had subscribed to a direct telephone connection offered by NTL received letters warning them that it was stopping its telephone service due to safety concerns about its equipment. No details were given as to the nature of the safety concerns, but shortly afterwards NTL technicians began arriving at houses in the area to start disconnecting the telephone systems.Two issues are involved in this case, namely, the safety question and the manner in which customers can be treated by a key service provider. Clearly the safety issue, if real, is the most important one. Householders were alarmed at the letters they had received and their concern was exacerbated by reports that two fires in houses in the area had been caused by faulty connections. I was contacted by a number of householders who had received these letters who asked me to try to find out what was going on.I was unable on Saturday to get anyone in authority to clarify the situation, neither was any information available on the company's website. When my office eventually made contact with NTL on Monday, the company was less than forthcoming, to put it mildly. This is an appalling way to treat customers and is in stark contrast to the approach of other companies when issues of consumer safety have arisen. In these cases, it would be the norm for the company to take out advertisements, to make company representatives available for interview on news and current affairs programmes and to provide a freephone service to reassure them about the steps being taken to ensure their safety. In this case, the company did the minimum and seemed more interested in protecting itself against any legal action than in reassuring worried householders.I welcome the statement from ComReg issued on Monday evening setting out the actions it was asking NTL to undertake, including the establishment of a dedicated freephone telephone number; discussions with other telephone service providers on the possibility of similar facilities for affected NTL customers; the establishment of call forwarding or call divert facilities; and the meeting by NTL of the direct costs which customers would otherwise have to pay. Although ComReg did not say so specifically, it is fair to infer from its statement that it was very critical of the manner in which NTL handled this controversy. I hope there will now be a very specific commitment from NTL that it will implement all the requirements set out in the ComReg statement without further delay.The second area of concern is the way in which customers are treated by a key service provider, licensed by the State to provide for what most people is now an essential public service. There are concerns among some householders that NTL may now take advantage of this controversy to provide itself with an exit strategy from what has proved to be an unprofitable business. NTL originally offered free Internet services to those who signed up with it, but has since been attempting to pull back from this offer. Efforts were made to persuade consumers to switch to broadband.The end result of all this is that householders are faced with cost and inconvenience. It will cost consumers up to €129 to get reconnected to the Eircom network. NTL originally indicated to consumers that it would pay for this but later suggested that it would simply offer credits to cover the cost. Neither is it clear how long this process will take. Many of those who have been hit are trades people and business people who depend on their phone service to earn their livelihood.The whole manner in which householders have been treated by NTL has been cavalier. As a result of NTL's actions, householders are in fear for their safety, have not been given the sort of information they should be entitled to, have been left without a telephone service and face unquantified additional costs. Service providers who treat their customers in this way should be subjected to some sanction and, if ComReg does not currently have the powers to take action against companies in cases like this, then the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources should give it the power to do so.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-12 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which highlights once again the need for a high level of awareness of fire safety and fire precautions in the home.The regulation of the communications sector is a matter for the Commission for Communication Regulation and I cannot speak for that body in this matter. However, I understand from media reports that there is a technical problem with telephone equipment supplied to customers by NTL which could have fire safety implications and that they have contacted their customers and instructed them to disconnect the equipment. From a fire safety point of view, it is desirable that customers comply with the instruction from NTL and disconnect the equipment. If they have not already done so, I strongly advise them to do so immediately.It would not be appropriate for me to comment on how the company should deal with this matter into the future. However, it appears that the company acted promptly on discovering the problem. It is a sobering statistic in this context that in 2003 more than 1,300 fires were attributed to problems with electrical equipment and electrical wiring. The discovery of this problem is timely as it comes in the immediate aftermath of the National Safety Council's fire safety week. This was a joint exercise with the Northern Ireland Fire Brigade which focused on the issue of fire safety in the community and reminded us of the danger fire poses for all of us. It is a sad statistic that in 2003, 51 people died in fires on the island of Ireland, many of which could and should have been prevented.Prevention is always better than cure and we must continue to get the message across in our communities about the dangers of fire and the need for a proactive approach to fire safety in our homes.Every year, fire brigades attend approximately 10,000 domestic fires. Each of these is a disaster for the household involved; even where there is no death or injury, the disruption and costs involved can be immense. The sad thing is that most of these fires just should not happen. I mentioned electrical fires already; other very common causes of domestic fires are unclean chimneys, failure to use fire guards and accidents involving cigarette smoking. A basic common sense approach to fire safety housekeeping could eliminate these disasters. This is the message which the Government, the fire authorities and the National Safety Council are constantly trying to get across.Another key message is the need to have early warning systems such as smoke alarms installed and in working order in our homes. If we do that, we can and will save lives and we will be well on the way to significantly reducing the number of fire fatalities in our communities. Analysis of the fire fatalities in domestic premises in this country indicates that a smoke alarm was either not present or was not working in the majority of cases. This is a tragic fact from which we all must learn.Fire safety in the home is the responsibility of the individual householder. Better awareness of the dangers of fire and of fire hazards, together with common sense fire prevention practices, the installation and maintenance of smoke alarms and having an escape plan, can all help to prevent and reduce the number of fires and the consequent tragic fatalities and injuries. I would ask all Members of this House to play their part in disseminating this fire safety message whenever and wherever the opportunity arises.
