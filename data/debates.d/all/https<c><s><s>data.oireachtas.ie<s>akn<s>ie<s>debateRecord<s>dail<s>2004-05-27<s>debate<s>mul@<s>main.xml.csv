#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. a4, Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) (Amendment) Bill 2004 — Order for Second Stage and Second and Subsequent Stages; No. 19, International Development Association (Amendment) Bill 2003 — Second Stage (Resumed); Child Trafficking and Pornography (Amendment) Bill 2004 [Seanad] — Second and Subsequent Stages, to be circulated on a Supplementary Order Paper, to be taken at 1.30 p.m., and the order shall resume thereafter.It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. a4. The proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.

The speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case. Members may share time, and a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed five minutes.The proceedings on Committee and Remaining Stages shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 30 minutes or at 1.30 p.m., whichever is the earlier, by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance. In the event of the Child Trafficking and Pornography (Amendment) Bill 2004 being passed by the Seanad and transmitted to the Dáil for agreement, it shall be taken at 1.30 p.m., and the following arrangements shall apply. The proceedings on Second Stage shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18701	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I know the Tánaiste and the Government are anxious to act expeditiously on this matter, and Fine Gael does not wish to obstruct them. However, it seems the Government is moving very rapidly. We were informed a few days ago that there would be a motion and no legislation. Now we see that two Bills must be passed before a process can be put in place.I would like to secure assurances from the Tánaiste that she is satisfied that what is being put in place is robust and that we will not find ourselves and the Houses of the Oireachtas in court needlessly trying to defend this process. I would like assurances that, despite the speed with which the Government is clearly acting, we are getting it right, and that the Oireachtas is not being brought into a process that will create difficulties which might have been anticipated had more time been taken.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Labour Party shares some of the concerns expressed by Deputy Bruton. Perhaps the Tánaiste and the Minister of State might acknowledge the fact that, had it not been for the Labour Party's private consultations with the Government, the legislation, if passed in its original draft form, would have effectively been null and void for the purposes for which it has hastily been brought before this House. That simply proves the point that we have made repeatedly that rushed legislation is invariably bad legislation. Nothing could be more rushed than what we are doing today. Owing to the nature of the problem with which this legislation has been drafted to deal, we will, very reluctantly, consent to it, but only on a reasonable condition to which I now ask the Tánaiste to accede on behalf of the Government.I draw attention to No. 92 on the legislative timetable, the judicial conduct and ethics Bill, which is due for publication later this year. It should be properly scrutinised by all Members of this House, including Government backbenchers, many of whom have very good legal expertise. I include Deputy Cassidy among their number, at least on the issue of copyright. The legislation should be dealt with by a committee of the House in a proper manner. That legislation which would deal with the matters to be addressed outside this House would, in effect, render redundant the legislation we are now going to put through in a belt and braces manner. We would have a safer and more secure Act.We are dealing with a sensitive matter, namely, the relationship between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary and the independence of that institution from this one. Therefore, we need to get it right. The big fear is we think we have got this one right, but we are not 100% sure. The second Bill, in our analysis, is necessarily belt and braces but no more than that. I am sorry for going on and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his indulgence. I am not——

She is not in a position to do it now, but perhaps she could do so some time during the course of today.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, appreciates the sensitivity and the unprecedented nature of the task before the House. However, it is a matter of some regret that from the Technical Group's viewpoint, participation in the process is restricted to one Deputy, although the task is unenviable and hardly one where a large queue of people will seek to embroil themselves because of the complexity of the situation. There are two parties, as recognised under Standing Orders, with the Socialist Party and other Independents as well who must agree on just one spokesperson. I want to note that as a matter of regret, although we appreciate the issue has to be dealt with in as unified a way as possible from the House's point of view, having regard to the need to be objective and thorough. We must avoid getting embroiled in legal problems later which we have been warned about and we need reassurance on this issue.The issue of judicial behaviour is being discussed. It is important that we do not revisit this situation unwittingly by overlooking the important issue of judicial appointments. It is a matter that needs to be included in some way within the terms of reference, although not perhaps during the strict task ahead of us. It must be taken into account, however, because we do not want to be coming back to this situation again.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I thank the Opposition parties for their co-operation and support as regards these matters. I accept what they have said, namely, that because of the sensitivity and the difficulty surrounding Judge Curtin, they were prepared to agree to the timeframe imposed by the Government and that is greatly appreciated. Obviously, these are uncharted waters. We have never gone down this road before. One can never be 100% certain when doing something for the first time and clearly all legislation is open to legal challenge.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	That is wrong. The Government knew it could come at any time.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Attorney General and his office have spent a considerable amount of time over the past few weeks looking at all of the legal issues surrounding this whole matter. We are satisfied the legislation being put forward is sound from that perspective. As regards Deputy Quinn's point, the Government's intention is to bring in this legislation later this year. I will refer to him later as regards the timeframe for that, but it is the intention to have that legislation produced later this year.On Deputy Sargent's point, the motion for the committee will be at a later stage, next week.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18701	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I am glad to hear the Attorney General is satisfied that this is robust. I share the Tánaiste's concern that we are entering into uncharted waters. I also share the sentiment expressed by Deputy Joe Higgins to the effect that we would not be in this situation if the Government had anticipated these sorts of problems, as it had outlined in its programme on legislation. However, I presume the issues such as admissibility of evidence relating to this pornography issue will be properly thought through. Considerable concern has been expressed over the flawed warrants in this case. This is the evidence that will now be reviewed by the committee. I presume that has also been seriously addressed.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18701	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I seek the Chair's advice with regard to a matter. Article 28.4.1° of the Constitution states that the Government is responsible to the Dáil. However, yesterday the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service voted down by a Government majority the right of the Oireachtas to hold hearings on and scrutinise the Government's programme on decentralisation. This is a programme on which there has been no debate in the Dáil, no vote in the Dáil, no Government memorandum presented, no strategic policy paper presented, and no assessment on how it fits into the spatial strategy. Some 10,000 public servants are being asked to move out of Dublin without having any view of the options they will have for the future. A question arises as to what rights the Oireachtas has to scrutinise proposals, albeit ones on which the Government has made a decision. We nonetheless have the right to scrutinise that decision, to ensure the best thinking has gone into it. If there are lessons and modifications that need to be made, the Oireachtas should have the opportunity to suggest them and have the case heard.I seek the Chair's guidance as to how the rights of Members may be exercised as regards this important strategic decision for the future of the public service. The location of the public service should not be decided by the Government on a political whim for electoral reasons. I seek the Chair's guidance on how we are going to do this, because we have been obstructed in the one way——

On matters of accountability generally where the Chair might have responsibility, it would have to be given notice of such matters. The House will hear Deputies Quinn and Sargent, briefly, but this is a matter for the committee.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	29	On the same topic, this matter was discussed yesterday evening at the committee to which Deputy Bruton has referred. The Chairman of that committee, Deputy Fleming, agreed to the proposal that such a session would take place allowing a structured debate in a manner acceptable to all. However, he then got instructions from somewhere else in this House——
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	As usual.

Among the Chair's many duties is one to protect the interests of all Members of this House. Can the Chair indicate if such a reversal of a procedure is in accordance with the rules of the House? I do not think it is.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I sought to have this matter debated by way of Standing Order 31. Will the Chair now give some consideration to this issue? I make the point, not just because it may be related to promised legislation but because the end of May was given as the date for civil servants to hear about the arrangements. There is a widespread view, which is understandable, that it is not now going to be announced until after the local and European elections. I would ask that this be clarified because if the end of May was given as the date by which announcements would be made, the Oireachtas needs to debate it today. This is the last sitting day before the elections. Will the Tánaiste say whether there has been a shifting of sands and if the date has been put back until after the local and European elections, for obvious electoral reasons?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Fine Gael Party put down a motion on this matter a year ago in the Dáil, calling for 10,000 civil servants to be relocated from Dublin. In the course of that debate Deputy Kenny said he felt the number could be 18,000 who wanted to move out of Dublin. I do not know why Fine Gael is suddenly taking a different view of this.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18701	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	On a point of order, this is a question of whether the Oireachtas has an entitlement to scrutinise Government decisions that could have an enormous impact on the delivery of public services.

He signed it two days before the nominations closed. The Tánaiste stood over that and allowed it to happen. This is hypocrisy at its worst. What will the Tánaiste do about it? Will the Minister come in and explain why he signed that order two days before the closing date for the nominations? It is an abuse of ministerial office. Will the Tánaiste respond?

I refer to the solemn responsibility placed by the Constitution on Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann in regard to the possibility of the removal of a judge from office in accordance with Article 35.4 of the Constitution. It is proposed that motions to initiate that process will be brought forward next week. In the meantime, the Government, acting on its legal advice, has introduced this Bill to facilitate whatever procedures the Houses decide to put in place to enable them to discharge that responsibility.This Bill provides a power that will be available on any future occasion that the Houses of the Oireachtas may be called upon to contemplate the removal of a judge, of which I hope there will not be many.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Under its provisions, a judge may be compelled to appear before and provide evidence to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas that may be set up in connection with the exercise by the Houses of the power provided in Article 35.4 of the Constitution. Mindful of the importance of preserving the independence of the Judiciary, the power to compel a judge proposed by this Bill is framed very narrowly and specifically.It relates only to circumstances where the removal of a judge, pursuant to Article 35.4 of the Constitution, is being contemplated. It also relates only to a judge who is the subject of such a process. It is inconceivable that the Houses of the Oireachtas should embark on such a solemn process without having the capacity to require the judge to assist them in that process. In all other circumstances, the exemption from compellability for judges in their capacity as judges will remain. The independence of judges in the exercise of their judicial functions is not compromised by this measure.It is proposed to amend the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997 by inserting a new section, section 3A, after section 3 of that Act. Paragraph (a) of the new section 3A provides that section 3 of the 1997 Act shall, notwithstanding section 3 (4) and (11) of the 1997 Act, apply to a judge where a committee is established for the purpose of a matter arising under: (i) section 4 of Article 35 of the Constitution; (ii) section 39 of the Courts of Justice Act 1924; or (iii) section 20 of the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act 1946.Paragraph (b) of the new section 3A clarifies that a “committee”, as defined in the 1997 Act, which is established in connection with the behaviour or capacity of a judge, means a committee established before or after the enactment of the Bill. The paragraph also clarifies that such a committee may deal with the behaviour or capacity of a judge whether the behaviour or capacity in question occurred or occurs before or after the enactment of this Bill.When the Bill is enacted, a committee, established to consider the possible removal from office of a judge, will have the power to direct a judge to attend before it, to give evidence and to produce any document in his or her possession or power as directed by the committee.This is merely an enabling power. It is a matter for decision by any such committee as to whether it wishes to invoke the power, following the procedures laid down in the 1997 Act, which requires among other matters, the prior consent of the appropriate subcommittee.Deputies will also be aware that the "appropriate subcommittee" referred to in section 3A is defined in the 1997 Act. Where a committee appointed by either House of the Oireachtas or a subcommittee of such a committee is seeking powers of compellability, the necessary consent is given by a subcommittee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of that House. Where the committee in question is appointed jointly by both Houses of the Oireachtas, the consent must be given by a subcommittee appointed jointly by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of each House.Under the existing legislation, a committee already has these powers in respect of other potential witnesses. The issue of compellability is only one component, but an essential one, of a framework in which a committee of the Oireachtas can effectively carry out its functions in regard to a process of this kind.I commend the Bill as an essential component in a framework under which the Oireachtas can, when necessary, effectively discharge its duty on foot of Article 35.4 of the Constitution, by providing it with the power to call all witnesses who have pertinent information, and also to obtain all relevant documentation and material.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	113	My focus and that of the Fine Gael Party since the Judge Curtin controversy blew up, has been twofold; first, to ensure confidence is retained in the Judiciary and, second, to ensure fair process will apply in any dealings with Judge Curtin, or any judge facing removal under Article 35 of the Constitution.In addressing the legislation before the House, to some extent we have to take the Government at face value. It now says an amendment to the compellability legislation is required in the context of the Oireachtas discharging its functions under section 35 of the Constitution.I do not oppose the legislation on the basis that the Government, which has unlimited legal resources, knows exactly what it is doing and has thought through the process. I also accept it on the basis that the Government must accept full and complete responsibility for the process it has initiated and the legislative and other procedures now proposed.Two points arise in connection with the timing. It was clear when the Judge Curtin controversy blew up that we were operating in a legislative and procedural vacuum. We must ask why? The Sheedy case occurred five years ago. This problem was recognised by the Government on its formation two years ago, when it gave a solemn commitment to legislate to provide effective remedies for complaints about judicial misbehaviour. Nothing has been done due to incompetence on the part of the Government. This is all the more serious in view of the weighty constitutional matter of how to deal with the Judiciary.We are being asked today to rush two legislative measures through both Houses of the Oireachtas. What is the rush? I thought there would be an explanation for this. I spent two hours with the Attorney General on Wednesday, 19 May. I raised with him the question of the need for legislation and was assured it was not necessary; that what was proposed was a motion to be put before the House under Article 35 of the Constitution. On Tuesday of this week I was advised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, that one item of legislation would be required in addition to two motions. Yesterday at 5 p.m., the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, informed me that a second item of legislation would be required. In seven days we went from no legislation and one motion to two items of legislation and two motions. There is an old saying, "More haste, less speed", in the part of the country I represent.In many ways the Government reminds me of a group that embarked on a journey while, in political terms, trying to give an impression of strength and assertiveness. It embarked on the journey in a rusty old van without checking whether there was enough fuel in the tank, whether there were headlamps to illuminate the darkness and, apparently, without brakes to enable it to slow down or stop when required. There have already been two breakdowns or pitstops to make emergency repairs. My view, which I hope is constructive, on behalf of the main Opposition party, in dealing with matters of such grave constitutional import, is that it is better to do it right than to do it quickly. I know of no reason for this rush to judgment.I said that I will not oppose the legislation. However, I have considerable concerns about it. These concerns are in no way assuaged by the record of the Government to date in dealing with this issue in general and in dealing with the controversy since it erupted some weeks ago. Essentially, the substance of the legislation is that it will make a judge, about whom a removal motion is tabled under Article 35, amenable to a committee of the Oireachtas. That judge will be compelled to attend before the Oireachtas. Under the section, it is not just a question of attending before the Oireachtas because the committee will be able to direct in writing a person's attendance and it will also be able to direct that person to produce to it any documents in his or her possession. In addition, it will be able to issue such further directions it considers reasonable in the circumstances.Will a question not arise as to why a judge should be required to produce documents or other evidence? Will the judge not ask how such a request stands with the issue of self-incrimination or what consideration has been given to the right to silence? Under our law, a person cannot be forced to answer questions which could lead to self-incrimination. The American equivalent is the fifth amendment. That a person cannot be placed in a position to incriminate himself or herself is one of the unenumerated fundamental rights that exists under our Constitution. Irish law is clear in this regard. Have matters been fully teased out in what the Government is proposing in this rushed legislation?There are precedents in cases under the European Convention on Human Rights. I refer to the Saunders case in the UK, involving an employee of Guinness, the Quinn case in Ireland, taken under the Offences against the State Act, and the Fulk case in Austria. Have these authorities been checked in terms of what is being proposed here?There is also the question as to whether one can confer powers which enable compellability to be exercised in respect of actions or events which preceded the existence of the power to compel. I refer here to retrospection. Is it possible to provide or exercise new powers in respect of events which occurred in the past? Has this matter been considered and, if so, what is the position in respect of it?Are we, in effect, changing the conditions of employment of judges? Has this matter been looked at? Under the Constitution, security of tenure is provided and goes to the basis of the independence of the Judiciary. Are we now providing a power to a committee of the Oireachtas that will change those conditions? Will it apply to existing judges or only to new judges? Does a question mark hang over matters in this regard?There is also the matter of privilege. I would have thought that this would also have been dealt with. What is the position regarding the privilege of the judge? As I understand it, under the 1997 Act there is a difference between a person voluntarily attending and a person compelled to attend. Is it because of that distinction that we are dealing with this legislation or is it because of questions raised about the admissibility of certain evidence to be brought before the committee?The House deserves a more detailed explanation with regard to this legislation. I am not pointing the finger of blame at the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. This matter is the responsibility of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General. The House deserves more than having an item of legislation put before it without answers to the questions I have raised being provided. The public also deserves more. We are dealing with such fundamental issues, as far as the Constitution is concerned, that the wisdom of this unseemly haste must be questioned. I do not believe the Government is taking a wise approach. I would have much preferred to see a full Bill dealing, as promised, with the issue of misbehaviour by judges and judges in general come before the House. I would also have preferred to see such legislation emerge without the current controversy intruding upon it.Has full consideration been given to all the issues? In the past seven days the Government has lurched from one crisis to another and, as a consequence, we are being presented with legislation on the hoof. My experience is that such legislation generally tends to be bad legislation.The purpose of the Bill appears to be to place a member of the Judiciary in the same position as any other citizen as regards attendance before a committee. It can, in one sense, be presented in that fashion but I am not sure it will achieve that purpose. In effect, we are talking about putting a judge in a situation only when he is facing a charge or a situation where removal under Article 35 is under consideration. If, under the 1997 Act, that judge fails to comply with a direction under Article 3 in this situation, he or she is guilty of an offence. Such an offence gives rise to a situation where, on summary conviction, the judge can be fined up to £1,500 or imprisoned for 12 months. On indictment, the fine rises to £20,000 or a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. That is a serious power we are invoking, in statutory terms, and it requires further consideration. No other person would be placed in that position because there is no other person against or about whom a removal motion can be tabled under Article 35.4 of the Constitution.I will conclude as I began by saying that I am not opposing the legislation because the Government is seeking it on the basis that the Oireachtas needs it. However, I have major concerns about some of the provisions it contains and some of the consequences to which it might give rise. I am also concerned about other aspects of this matter, such as those relating to the admissibility of evidence, in general, to any committee that we might establish. It is not in the interests of the people, the House or justice that we should rush with unseemly haste to place a bung in the hole as soon as we see it without recognising what could be the consequences and that further damage could be caused.It is with reluctance that I go along with what is proposed today. I do so on the basis that the Government must accept complete responsibility for the consequences of its actions here and for any difficulties that may arise as a result of its hasty actions and legislation.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I will start at the point where Deputy O'Keeffe ended regarding the manner with which we are dealing with the issues today. It is always unsatisfactory to deal with legislation in a restricted period of time. It is particularly careless to deal with all Stages of two such Bills on the same day in both Houses of the Oireachtas.I hope the legislation being put through today will be without flaw and will stand the test of time. However, the track record is that difficulties arise in such instances. This legislation has not had a great preamble. Initially we were told all that was required to deal with the matter was a single motion. Then we were told we needed two motions and following this that we would need some form of enabling legislation. We have gone from one motion to two motions and from no Bill to one and then two Bills.The proposed method of dealing with the issue has been very much something of an ad hoc process over recent weeks. If this type of stumbling approach pertains, flaws none of us has perceived may still remain. In her reply the Minister of State should give us the benefit of her thoughts on why this legislation must be put through so quickly without opportunity for reflection between the different Stages or the different Bills.However, this Bill is welcome as a desirable general measure which is not limited to a particular case. It fills the gap in the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997. That Act had a general exemption for judges which was far too wide. In cases of impeachment there should be provision for compellability of judges. We should acknowledge also that privilege is an interesting follow on of compellability.Although the process has been flawed to date, I welcome the opportunity it provided for consultation in drafting legislation, an opportunity the Labour Party availed of. Our concern was that the original draft applied only to removal of a judge under Article 35.4 of the Constitution, which only applies to High Court and Supreme Court judges. We suggested to the Government that the legislation be extended to cover the Courts of Justice Act 1924, which covers Circuit Court judges, and to the legislation which applies to District Court judges, the Courts of Justice (District Court) Act 1946. After the extensive consultation yesterday between the Labour Party and the Government we welcome the Government's acceptance of our point and its adjustment of the draft of the Bill to include the statutory provisions relating to Circuit Court and District Court judges. It would cause considerable embarrassment if the only reference in this legislation was to Article 35.4 of the Constitution, particularly as the specific purpose of this legislation, as well as its general intent, is to cover a measure relating to a judge of a lower court.We note that the judges of the Special Criminal Court are not covered by this legislation. I presume that is because they are removed in such circumstances by Government decision and not by the Oireachtas. There is therefore no necessity for a committee of inquiry in such a situation. However, this is another example of the distinctions that exist between statutory provisions, the constitutional provision and the entitlement of the Government to act in the removal in a particular category.We are also conscious that notwithstanding this Bill some exemptions as to compellability will remain in law, particularly the exemption for the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. In the event of any motion of impeachment being proposed and a committee being established, it would be vital that the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions provide full co-operation to the committee so that the absence of compellability would not arise as a problem. This is a considerable concern.The Minister of State towards the end of her address said:I commend the Bill as an essential component in a framework under which the Oireachtas can, when necessary, effectively discharge its duty on foot of Article 35.4 of the Constitution, by providing it with the power to call all witnesses who have pertinent information, and also to obtain all relevant documentation and material.This is the intent of the Bill. However, a situation might arise where it would be pertinent to call the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions as witnesses. It would be expected that they would come voluntarily, nevertheless we should reserve the entitlement to return and amend the legislation in this respect. I hope, this is a problem that will not arise. However, if it does, it must be addressed. Nobody can be above the law.It is also important that any committee dealing with impeachment should keep the scope of its compellability powers under review so that in the event of a problem arising the matter would return to the Oireachtas for consideration as to whether further amending legislation was required. In this area the draft motion, as envisaged, could be amended to ensure that if an issue, obstacle or problem arises which needs addressing by legislation, the committee can return the legislation to the Dáil or Seanad for amendment. It would be appropriate to deal with this issue also.Let us examine the various methods by which impeachment can take place. The constitutional entitlement to impeach refers only to High Court and Supreme Court judges. The 1924 Act refers to Circuit Court judges and the 1946 Act refers to District Court judges. We also have the authority of the Government to remove Special Criminal Court judges. These various methods cause something of an anomaly and confusion on how to deal with what might be regarded as gross misbehaviour on the bench.It is time to consolidate the legislation into some Act which will cover the scope of what is required. This would mean we would probably need separate legislation from the proposed judicial conduct and ethics Bill. We are not just talking about the normal range of misconduct and guidelines for ethics etc, but about an impeachment process. We are therefore talking about two Bills which need to be put in place in the near future. I hope legislation which will incorporate all levels of the Judiciary will be put in place at an early stage.The judicial conduct and ethics Bill, to which Deputy Quinn referred on the Order of Business, was promised for this year.I will refer to what has been promised regarding that Bill and to its purpose. I was glad to hear the Tánaiste say she envisaged it would be published in 2004, but from memory I recall it was promised in 2003 and in 2002. We remember the debacle in 2001 when the botched constitutional referendum was introduced by the then Minister responsible, Deputy O'Donoghue, which clouded the scene. I hope there is an intent in respect of that Bill to address this area. There has always been a reluctance on the part of the Executive to engage in any fashion with the Judiciary in terms of procedures in legislation that would direct and regulate the behaviour of the Judiciary because of the separation of powers. It is time to grasp that particular nettle. This Bill proposes to provide effective remedies for complaints about judicial misbehaviour, including lay participation in the investigation of the complaints.All of us will be aware that from time to time judicial behaviour can be something of an embarrassment in terms of remarks made by judges. There are no guidelines, structures or induction process for a person who becomes a judge. A person who sits in the Bar Library or a legal practitioner in the Law Library may suddenly be appointed to the Bench. Such a person would move from a position where he or she pleads a case for or against a client in a manner that advocates as strongly as possible a particular position, to suddenly becoming like Solomon sitting on the Bench and operating in an impartial fashion. There are no rules laid down for that and there is no induction process. We cannot accept any longer that we can operate in this fashion without professional standards and regulations and a code of conduct clearly outlined as to how we will move from the point of appointing a judge to that judge operating in the fairest and best way possible. From that point of view, the introduction of the judicial conduct and ethics Bill is most important.Together with that legislation, we also require the putting in place of procedures on judicial appointments, in respect of which I do not know if legislation will be required. There is an anomaly whereby, on the one hand, there is a separation of powers among the Executive, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Judiciary and, on the other, there is a cosy arrangement whereby virtually all those appointed to the Judiciary are members of one political party or another.

There is no doubt there is a certain political element to judicial appointments. We all hear of cases of lobbying in the Bar and so on. If there is to be a proper separation of powers, we must have an independent judicial appointments structure. A Government should not appoint a person to the Judiciary on the basis of what seems to be a political capacity. I have no doubt that judicial appointments in the vast majority of cases are persons of the highest calibre. Nevertheless, all practices should be transparent and we should put in place the necessary structures to ensure they are because currently that is not the case.In terms of this legislation, no citizen is above the law. If we are to promote justice in a meaningful fashion, nobody should have the right to choose to appear before a tribunal or in this case, impeachment proceedings, on a voluntary basis. Justice and the issues involved are too important for us not to have in place procedures on compellability that ensure every citizen is treated equally before the law in that regard.

I received this Bill this morning and have had little chance to look at it. I am informed it must be passed by 1.30 p.m. The Bill deals with a serious issue which must be addressed. Members of the public must be placated to some extent regarding this issue. We have extended the sittings in a week by a day on numerous occasions during the lifetime of this Dáil. I would have thought this would be a suitable occasion to devote a full day to debating this Bill tomorrow and not to have to rush it through today. We have to quickly put forward our views on it and it is likely to be subject to some form of constitutional challenge. We are expected to give in a matter of minutes expert opinion on it. We only received the Bill this morning and it is dangerous to rush it through these Houses.Members of the public are outraged that the case against Judge Curtin was lost on a technicality. It appears there was a good deal of bungling in that regard. Effectively, in the eyes of members of the public, Judge Curtin is still innocent. I did not see Judge Curtin specifically mentioned in the Bill, therefore it will apply to people across the board. It will apply to gardaí and to people who are innocent who can be brought before committees of the Oireachtas. We are threading a fine line in terms of impinging on people's constitutional rights and as to whether an innocent person should be brought before an Oireachtas committee. It would be much more preferable to allow time for reflection and proper debate on this Bill by extending the sittings this week by one day. Members of the public will not be pleased when they learn Members were presented with the Bill this morning, that they have had only a few minutes to look at it — I do not fully understand it — and are being asked to pass intelligent comment on it. It is quite difficult to do so.The Bill provides that the Oireachtas may direct any person to attend before a committee. That is a wide-ranging and dangerous provision. Everyone knows the reason we are passing this legislation at this point in time. It has to do with the Judge Curtin case. The Bill also provides that the Oireachtas may direct a person in attendance before a committee to produce to the committee any document. It is desirable in the case in question that people can be compelled to produce documents. People will link this legislation to the Judge Curtin case. At this point such a provision is desirable, but in the long term and when the Judge Curtin case is long past, I do not know how desirable it will be to have such a provision inserted in legislation.The Bill provides that the Oireachtas may also direct in writing any person to send to the committee any document in his or her possession. This is a serious provision. There is no difficulty with linking that provision to the case in question. Everybody would want legislation rushed through to deal with a difficult position but in the longer term such legislation could have dangerous consequences. The Bill also provides that the Oireachtas may direct in writing any person to make discovery on oath of any documents that are or have been in that person's possession. This provision is highly desirable at this point in time but in the long term it could have severe implications for people's constitutional rightsSection 3(1) of the 1997 Act states that a committee may "give any other directions for the purpose of the proceedings concerned that appear to the committee to be reasonable and just." We know what we consider to be "reasonable and just", but a committee may have a different interpretation. This is what happens when laws are rushed through. When this case has been dealt with, we will have to consider the future implications of the legislation.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	120	We are told that hard cases lead to bad law, but there is a danger today that the House will create bad law to justify hard cases. Such a danger always exists when legislation is rushed in reaction to specific instances. Emergency legislation has been introduced half a dozen times in this Dáil in a political response to various court decisions and other activities outside the House. Such legislation could and should have been the subject of more consideration. The Green Party will not oppose this Bill, although our instinct is to oppose it because of our belief in certain principles. Not only are we opposed to the haste with which the Bill is being brought forward, but we have concerns about the fact that an important issue is once more being addressed in a piecemeal fashion with a Bill that needs wider consideration and amendment.Although issues of judicial misconduct and incapacity have existed since the Sheedy case, the House has failed to introduce legislation to address properly such problems. The power of Oireachtas committees to act effectively in respect of compellability has been compromised since the court decision on the Abbeylara sub-committee, but no legislation has been proposed for the consideration and approval of the House. The Government's failure of management has to be seen as a factor in the way we are rushing this Bill and the Bill we will consider this afternoon. It is only fair, therefore, to state the Green Party's concerns and fears that such an approach will not be successful in the end. As regards the wider issues of judicial misconduct and incapacity, the House has yet to debate in detail the crying need for legislation to address areas such as induction and ongoing training of the Judiciary.The principle of separation of the Government, the Legislature and the Judiciary is a sound one in any democracy, and we should be slow to allow it to be compromised in any way. As we embark on an unnecessary and dangerous constitutional referendum on citizenship, we need to ask why a more important and necessary constitutional consideration — the relationship between the Judiciary and the political system — has not been addressed. My party argues that the constitutional provision being discussed with this Bill should continue to apply to judges and justices of the High Court and the Supreme Court. If we have a proper Bill and a proper constitutional amendment, it will be much easier to deal with future cases involving District Court and Circuit Court judges. We should examine the constitutional implications of such a measure. We are choosing not to pursue such a consideration because we prefer to proceed in such a rushed manner.The power of the House to address public interest issues would be taken more seriously if political responsibility were removed from the compromising manner in which people are appointed to the Judiciary. I do not doubt for a moment the independence of such people, following their appointment to the Judiciary. One's previous track record and associations remain too large a factor in determining how and when one becomes a member of the Judiciary. The failure of the House to address that issue will continue to put a mark on the degree of independence that should exist in the judicial system. A young barrister approached me several years ago to ask to join my political party. His logic for wanting to join my party was that a judicial position would be influenced in his favour at some future time.

Is trua é nach bhfuil tuilleadh ama againn agus leagan amach an sórt ama agus an sórt próiséis gur chóir go mbeadh ann i leith reachtaíochta sa doiciméad "Regulating Better". Leagann an doiciméad amach faoi reachtaíocht ar dtús go mbeadh "draft heads" foilsithe roimh ré agus ansin "regulatory impact analysis" foilsithe chomh maith. An rud atá i gceist ansin, bheadh freagraí ar fáil do cheisteanna an Teachta O'Keeffe dá mbeadh sé seo déanta mar, i "Regulating Better" deir sé "regulatory impact analysis is a policy tool designed to identify and quantify, where possible, the impact of new regulations." Níl sé sin déanta go hiomlán sa chás seo.Tuigeann gach duine a labhair go dtí seo cén fáth go bhfuil seo á dhéanamh. Tá an Freasúra ar fad sásta glacadh leis agus tacú leis tríd an Teach de réir an chuma ar an scéal go dtí seo ach tá buairt orainn mar gheall ar an deifir. An fhadhb leis an deifir ná go bhfuil an judicial conduct and ethics Bill fós ar an gclár, mar a luaigh roinnt de na Teachtaí cheana. Ba chóir dúinn a bheith ag deileáil leis an mBille sin inniu mar is léir dom ó bhí mise sa Teach seo gur féidir leo siúd a chuireann reachtaíocht le chéile reachtaíocht a chur le chéile faoi deifir agus ansin gur féidir linn treabhadh tríd agus déileáil leis focal ar fhocal. Ní gá gur é an reachtaíocht is fearr é nuair a dhéantar deifir. B'fhearr liom go mbeadh níos mó ama againn go mbeimis in ann suí síos agus dul tríd seo pointe ar phointe agus ansin teacht go dtí staid gur féidir linn ar fad glacadh leis agus go bhfuil na freagraí do na ceisteanna ar fad atá luaite cheanna féin ar fáil.Leagann an Rialtas amach an am-chlár. B'fhéidir gur chóir go nglacfadh sé leis go bhfuil freagracht áirithe aige, toisc go bhfuil sé ag déanamh na deifre seo. Níl a fhios agam an mbeadh mórán difríocht dá bhfanfaimis seachtain nó dhá sheachtain eile chun deise a thabhairt don bhFreasúra, ach go háirithe, comhairle dhlí cheart a fháil air seo. Ní bhfuair mé an deis dul i dteagmháil le dlíodóirí nó abhcóidí chun treabhadh tríd an mBille ina hiomlán agus féachaint an bhfuil aon mhór-cheisteanna ann. Caithfidh mé glacadh le meon an chuid eile den bhFreasúra agus an méid a luaigh an tArd-Aighne ar an gceist seo go dtí seo. Is trua sin mar b'fhearr liom an rud a chíoradh i gceart mé féin.Beidh orainn, dár ndóigh, mar a luaigh an Tánaiste níos luaithe, teacht ar ais chuig an cheist seo nuair atá muid ag déileáil leis an judicial conduct and ethics Bill. Tá súil agam ansin, má tá aon mhion-bhotúin nó mór-bhotúin sa reachtaíocht seo, go ndéanfaimid é seo a athrú chomh tapaidh agus is féidir. Tá sé ceart go leor an t-athrú seo a dhéanamh mar tá sé gafa go díreach leis an cheist áirithe seo, an cheist faoi compellability, agus nach bhfuil ach i gceist breitheamh a bheith cúisithe nó a chaithfidh freagra a thabhairt mar gheall ar cheist Alt 35.4 den Bhunreacht. Sin an t-aon bhealach ba chóir go mbeimis ag déileáil leis seo. Glacaim leis an mBille agus tacaím leis in ainneoin na buartha atá orm.

I have a difficulty with the fact that we are dealing with emergency legislation in a rushed manner. I saw a copy of the Bill late last night that Deputy Jim O'Keeffe furnished to me. However, we are elected to enact good legislation and therefore we need time to consider the legislation that comes before us. I appreciate this is not the longest Bill ever published and, effectively, only runs to three pages. Since its potential ramifications for the future are quite substantial, it is regrettable to deal with it so quickly. I do not understand the urgency. Some years ago, during the Sheedy case, all these matters were discussed and legislation may even have been published to deal with this issue, yet nothing happened in the interim.The two Bills before us do not, in any sense, refer to why we are here, which is because of what has happened in the Curtin case. We are expected to put those facts to the back of our minds and examine the legislation as if it did not refer to anyone specifically — and it is not supposed to — yet we cannot do that. We are here because of that case. We must accept that the legislation is coming about because of what happened in that case and because the Government intends to proceed under Article 35.4 of the Constitution.During my short time in the House, I have seen difficulties arising with rushed legislation on a few occasions concerning immigration, radar guns and alcolysers used by the Garda Síochána. We have seen court judgments on such legislation, which amounts to giving Members of the Oireachtas a rap on the knuckles for having passed legislation that turned out to be flawed. I am concerned that at some future date we will find ourselves re-examining this legislation since I have little doubt it will end up before the Supreme Court whose judges may take issue with it.I wish to pose a number of questions because, like previous speakers, I am not sure of the answers. It is a pity we do not have answers to some of the issues that have been raised concerning this legislation. The first issue is that of retrospection. Neither the House nor an Oireachtas committee will be dealing with criminal proceedings when the matter comes before it; the criminal aspect of the Curtin case was dispensed with. We are not dealing with civil proceedings either, so in dealing with this matter we are very much in virgin territory.Under section 1(3A)(b) we are establishing a committee, “for the purposes of, or in connection with, the behaviour or capacity of a judge whether occurring or first arising before or after such passing.” I see potential difficulties in that because we are enacting legislation to deal with something that has already happened. We do not know what will happen to anyone, particularly this judge, who will be compelled to attend before the committee. I do not know if the serious ramifications that could arise have been examined sufficiently. Adopting retrospective legislation for actions that occurred previously is a new departure and one about which I have a great deal of concern. I accept what the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, said earlier, that it would be inconceivable for the House to commence such a solemn process without having the capacity to require the judge to assist it in that process. However, it is a serious issue to ask somebody to attend a committee and, effectively, lose his or her right to silence, which is what may be happening here.The purpose of the Bill is to put a member of the Judiciary in the same position as any other citizen as regards attendance before an Oireachtas committee. I do not know, however, if we are really putting that person in the same position as any other citizen because, in some ways, we are placing a different obligation on him or her, compared with other citizens.If one is satisfied the evidence acquired under the warrant is admissible in any hearing pursuant to Article 35.4, why are powers of compellability required? If the evidence can be used anyway, I do not see where the compellability issue arises. If a person is compelled to attend, the rule against self-incrimination may prevent his or her answers being used to support any contention of stated misbehaviour. That question needs to be answered before we go any further. Another question that needs to be answered is where the power of compellability will sit vis-à-vis a person’s right to remain silent.It is a pity we are considering this legislation in such a rushed manner. I note there is not a queue of Deputies, either on the Opposition or Government benches, waiting to speak on the legislation, which, in itself, says something. It would be better to have a proper allocation of time in which to tease out the legislation before us. What is said during this debate may be re-examined in the future and we may all be questioned about it.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	128	In common with other speakers, I am concerned that we are debating this legislation in a hurry. It is said that rushed legislation does not make for good law and we should have learned that over the years. If the Legislature finds itself in a difficulty, the answer is not to introduce legislation in a hurry in the hope that it will meet some future contingencies. Past experience has shown that is not the correct route to take, so I am concerned about the speed with which the legislation is being debated.I recall that, not so many years ago, when the original Bill was passed, it was said it would mark the end of all squabbles in that context, and that no unforeseen difficulties could arise in undertaking inquiries or investigations under that legislation. Apparently, however, that is not the case. It seems odd that we should now proceed to pass legislation under duress, as it were. The most worrying aspect is that on countless occasions in the past, we have done the same thing. We have passed legislation in a hurry and then found it did not meet the requirements, so we had to return to deal with the issues again.I am also aware there are other items of comprehensive legislation that could have the same effect as the Bill before us and which could have been brought before the House during the last two years but were not, for some unknown reason. One can speculate as to why that did not happen but I have heard no argument from the Government side as to why certain legislation was not introduced in the House. It could be introduced now and be passed through the House in the next week or so, achieving what it is intended to achieve with this amendment Bill. However, that was not done presumably because it might be deemed to have been rushed in attempting to legislate for past events which, as Deputies stated, is not such a good idea. For whatever reason it did not happen, even though it is on the legislative schedule which has been circulated to us during the life of this Government. There are problems which could well surface again. As the Minister of State knows, like other speakers, I am concerned that we might find ourselves in a cul-de-sac in three or four months' time. I wonder how we will then be able to look back on the passing of this Bill and its purpose.Whatever difficulties are likely to arise or have arisen, we need to be extremely careful not to bring ourselves into disrepute by running hither and tither to shore up positions willy nilly in regard to which comprehensive legislation could and should have been introduced and which would have dealt with the matter in its entirety.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I thank the Opposition parties for their co-operation in progressing this legislation. I accept it is unusual to introduce legislation to go through all Stages in the House at once. However, whereas this Bill has general applicability, the House is about to embark on a specific process. Article 35.4 of the Constitution gives the Houses of the Oireachtas the power to remove a judge for stated misbehaviour or incapacity but it does not give us the procedures by which this can be done. We all accept that it would be very dangerous to embark on a process without having all the necessary pillars, procedures and frameworks in place before we do so. This Bill is part of that framework to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to discharge its duties in fulfilling our constitutional role.Different views were expressed as to whether this Bill is necessary, as was evident from the briefing which was attended by the Opposition parties. However, it was felt that to bring clarity to the matter, it was advisable to proceed with it. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised a number of question as to how this Bill would affect judges. In the first instance, this measure will in no way affect the independence of judges. It is very specific in its application because it refers only to judges who would be the subject of a process which would be initiated by the Houses of the Oireachtas under Article 35.4 of the Constitution. Arising out of those consultations, the Bill before us is clearer and I thank Members for their input.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised the issues of attendance, documents and material, all of which are provided for in the existing Act for everyone except judges. This limited amendment will bring judges into the same position for one purpose only. Therefore, it in no way compromises them in their capacity as judges or their independence in carrying out their functions. Security of tenure of judges was also raised, which issue is set out in the constitutional framework, part of which is Article 35.4, therefore, there will be no change in that regard.In regard to the appointment of judges, Members will be aware that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established by the Government under the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995. It is a high level board comprising the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the Presidents of the High Court, Circuit Court and District Court, the Attorney General, two representatives of the legal profession and up to three representatives of public interest. The board assesses suitability under a number of different headings set out in the legislation and the Government then chooses from the recommended people.This Bill is very confined. It is an enabling power under the constitutional right which the committee may or may not need to use. The question of privilege was raised and it is important to point out that it is envisaged that the procedures, to be put in place to manage a process under Article 35.4, which would be applicable in any circumstances where a committee would have to gather evidence, would be in camera. Therefore, that is not an issue. More importantly, persons who are required to attend under compellability enjoy the same privilege as a witness before the High Court — that security is there for people.Members raised the haste with which this Bill has been introduced. It is a general Bill with general applicability but we are about to separately engage in a process. It is true to state that the issue was raised a number of years ago, but it was difficult at that time to get all-party agreement when the proposed constitutional framework on the matter of judicial oversight was set out. Therefore, we were not able to progress the matter at that time. An Agreed Programme for Government states that we would progress legislation in this area and, as Deputy Durkan more than anyone knows, the Government has passed more than 80 items of legislation since June 2002. Therefore, it is not as if we are slack in passing Bills.Careful consideration has been given to this Bill in the past few weeks, including by the Attorney General. The reality is that there is a current issue which has given rise to public disquiet and a lack of public confidence. In that context, we want to move without delay to try to resolve the issue. In doing so, we need to put in place the procedures which will enable us to fulfil our constitutional duty, procedures which will guarantee fairness and ensure that proper rights are given to everyone involved and to allow us to discharge our duties as Members of the Oireachtas. Other legislation will be introduced later in the year, including a Bill on judicial conduct and an ethics Bill.However, in the meantime, we believe this amendment is necessary. Questions were asked about the procedures which do not refer to this Bill but will be dealt with by the CPP and, in the particular circumstances of this one case, by motions which will come before the House next week. I thank the Opposition for its careful consideration and for allowing the Houses of the Oireachtas to discharge our duty.

Therefore, I will raise some issues to tease out some aspects of the section a little further. The most serious question which worries me about this legislation, and on which I would like as much assurance as possible, is the basic issue of how the power of compellability sits with the right to silence. In light of the Abbeylara inquiry, there must be a question over whether a committee can use powers under the 1997 Act in a manner which might oblige someone to incriminate himself or herself. This is a general issue. In this Bill, we are dealing with judges. We must address the rationale for the change. Judges are exempt from the powers of compellability under section 3 of the 1997 Act. What has not been highlighted is that they are only exempt when, as the 1997 Bill states, one is referring to a person who holds or held that office in his or her capacity as such holder. That fits in with the independence of the Judiciary — that its members would not be compellable in any way in relation to the functions exercised by a judge in his or her capacity as a holder of that office.I raise the question of whether there is a need for legislation at all, because the issue before us does not relate to any judicial decisions of Judge Curtin. It therefore appears that effectively that judge is in the same position as anyone else from the point of view of compellability except in relation to the exercise of his judicial function and we are not inquiring into the exercise of that function. That issue has not been teased out.There is also a question mark about the general right to silence and whether anyone coming before the committee would be obliged to incriminate themselves, which arises in the post-Abbeylara context. I am also concerned by the new power being rushed in. I do not know if that is needed, but it is my job to raise these issues. I would have preferred a more reflective approach.If we are putting a judge appearing before a committee for reasons other than his or her judicial functions in the same position as everyone else, then I return to the point that nobody else can be in the same position because nobody other than a judge can have an Article 35 motion tabled about them in the Oireachtas. We are not putting a judge in the same position as an ordinary person and we cannot do so.The Minister of State said that it was inconceivable that the Houses of the Oireachtas should embark on such a solemn process under Article 35 without having the capacity to require the judge to assist them in that process. Let us reflect on that. Are we saying we must have the power to require a judge to assist in a process leading to his or her removal? I wonder about that broad statement.I emphasise that my searching comments are designed to be constructive and to try to ensure that the process we end up with is a sound and valid one which will survive judicial scrutiny. The best way to do so is to be absolutely sure that the process is fair and in accordance with natural justice at all times. That is the thinking behind my fundamental questions about this process.We should go back to Deputy Enright's point about whether compellability is the right approach for the committee, in directing attendance and production of documents. Under the definition of the 1997 Act a document is any class or description of document and also includes a "thing". Are we talking about a computer? I do not know. If we are directing someone appearing before the committee to produce documents and things and to make discovery on oath then one must go back to the purpose for which the committee was set up — to investigate certain matters which may, under Article 35, lead to the removal of that person. That is my concern.Deputy Enright dealt with admissibility at greater length in her contribution than I did. If these documents and things, computers or otherwise, are admissible, despite the fact that they were held to be constitutionally tainted at the criminal trial, then the issue of compellability may not arise. I do not know. Has that been thought through? That is my concern. Admissibility is central to what we are discussing. Is this approach a fall-back if the admissibility approach fails?

In some senses the Judiciary is seen to be above the law and its members are not expected to abuse the law in any sense. However, every citizen is equal before the law and is subject to the law. Principles relating to compellability and immunity which apply to other citizens mean that the promotion of justice in serious matters of concern cannot be followed if a key witness has the right to choose whether or not to attend a committee. We are in uncharted constitutional waters when it comes to procedures, but what about our powers? Those must also be looked at to ensure that any procedure will use due process, will be comprehensive and will fulfil its functions properly.There should be no exemptions in the legislation. I would go a step further: the legislation would be better if we ended the exemptions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General. Why should they be exempt under the 1997 legislation? They remain the only two citizens who are exempt from being compelled to come before an Oireachtas committee and such compellability may be relevant.

To what extent was this considered by the Attorney General? Did he give advice about his position or was legal advice given by other counsel retained either by the Attorney General or the Government?The other point is whether we should have to revisit section 1.3A under which the two points arise concerning the Special Criminal Court. We have now extended the competence of this section to deal with judges of the High Court, the Supreme Court, the District Court and the Circuit Court but a judge of the Special Criminal Court is not covered under the legislation. Surely the entire Judiciary should be put within the remit of the legislation. I do not say this is a flaw in the legislation in terms of what we are trying to do. Given that we are passing legislation would it not be better to have it encompass the entire Judiciary in order that we do not have to come back with an amendment?Section 1.3A(b)provides that, “ ‘committee’ means a committee established, whether before or after the passing of this legislation.” Why was it deemed necessary to include “before” rather than “subsequent” to the passage of the legislation?
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	135	On Committee Stage we can use whatever opportunity we have to question some of the wording in the Bill and highlight the fact that it is being debated in a vacuum. That we are referring to Acts of 1924 and 1946 shows the lack of consolidation in this area and the large job of work that has to be done to put this in order.Given that we are dealing with compellability, privileges and immunities, an issue we have failed to address is how we as individual Members use our own privilege, not only within the House but in committees of the House. If we are to embark upon a process on foot of this legislation, whatever motions are likely to be put before the House, I would have liked some indication from legal officers of the State and of the House to indicate to what extent privilege can and should be used. Have statements been made by individuals that have compromised the process that may take place? While we have privilege as Members and can say things without the laws of libel coming into play, if a process is initiated under Article 35 which at the end of the day requires a full vote of this and the other House, we need answers to those questions before embarking on such a process. Has that privilege already been compromised? Are their individual Members who have said things that should not have been said and, if so, should the House decide what course of action should be open to them in terms of participating in a vote. Should we as a House decide what course of action should be open to them in terms of participating in a vote, abstaining from a vote and participating in whatever committee the House establishes to exercise its power under Article 35?On the central principle of whether the House should exercise its power under Article 35 I do not think there is any dissension. While we have a duty as legislators to give living example to the principle of who judges the judges, we are also guided by the principles of natural justice. The procedures we are about to put in place and see through to a conclusion have to be guided by those principles. While we are judging judges we should ensure we are not a judge in our own court. All the principles of natural justice that apply to any other citizen of the State should apply to anyone who comes under the process we are trying to put in place through this legislation and whatever motions are put before the House.When the issue at hand has been dealt with, I hope, given the Tánaiste's commitment on the Order of Business today, there will be a wide ranging and detailed examination of the legislation that needs to be put in place and the constitutional provisions that need to be examined and, if necessary, changed and put in place. This matter continues to be a constitutional and legal mess. It does no credit to any of us involved in the political process, or those who enact the legislation through decisions of the judicial process on a daily basis, that we allow this situation to continue. I hope there is a collective will to use the time of the House in a better and more comprehensive way to ensure Bills of this type are not put before us in this way for consideration in the future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I shall take the questions in reverse order. Deputy Boyle's questions related to process. We have to ensure there are fair procedures and that natural justice is observed. Much discussion has taken place during the past week or so — and will continue over the next few days — to ensure the process, the motions we pass and any committee set up for a specific investigation, fulfil all those criteria. We look forward to continuing to work with the Opposition parties in that area. That is the situation regarding a specific case.I do not accept Deputy Costello's view that the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General are the only people exempt. All judges are still exempt from this except if they are the subject of a process to have them removed from office under Article 35.4 of the Constitution. It is only in those very limited circumstances that the Bill would allow for a judge to be called. I would not envisage a committee inquiring into other circumstances in respect of the activities of a Director of Public Prosecutions or an Attorney General. It would only gather evidence in regard to the potential removal from office of a judge. Deputy Costello asked also about members of the Special Criminal Court. Judges of the Special Criminal Court are members of the Judiciary in the first instance and are then appointed to serve on the Special Criminal Court, so they are covered by this legislation.Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello asked about compelling a judge in his or her capacity as a judge. This was the question asked during the past week or so. There were different legal opinions as to whether this legislation is needed because activities might relate to a person outside his or her role as a judge. For example, as Deputy O'Keeffe indicated, a decision of the court is not something one would be looking at. This Bill will apply to extra-judicial conduct but only in the context of an inquiry arising out of that person's capacity as a judge. Given that it will be in the context of our constitutional power under Article 35.4, the possible end game of that inquiry would affect that person in his or her role as a judge because it would seek to remove him or her from his or her role as a judge. For that reason we sought to bring about the legislation.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asked about the committee requiring a person to come before it. There is every possibility in the event of people going down this road that a person in question, or a judge, would come before a committee voluntarily to give information. That is allowed for. This is an enabling power. It allows the committee to have the power to call in the person who is the subject of the investigation and to get all the information from that person. It will be a different committee from the committee inquiring into the events at Abbeylara. The Abbeylara committee was set up by a rule of the House whereas in setting up any committee for this process we will be exercising our constitutional power, which gives it a different status.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe asked about the right to silence. As he is well aware the right to silence is a feature of the criminal law. Section 12 of 1997 Act provides for the non-admissibility in criminal proceedings of evidence given under direction. That should cover that issue. A judge is autre fois acquit, a criminal law principle that he cannot be put in jeopardy in a criminal case a second time for the same offence, in the event of that arising in any process.On the question of retrospection, this Bill relates to the process and it will apply prospectively in that it will be applicable any time after its enactment where the matter of invoking compellability arises. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the prospective application of the power cannot be questioned solely on the grounds that a committee seeking to exercise it came into being before the measure was enacted. It is a matter of prudent precaution. It also clarifies that power to invoke compellability prospectively cannot be challenged on the grounds that the relevant behaviour occurred or capacity arose before the measure was enacted. That is the reason for introducing this. I hope I have addressed some of the issues raised.

The bottom line is whether the evidence in the upcoming case is tainted by unconstitutionality and can be made available to a committee set up by this House. I understand there are conflicting views on that. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to be very firm that there will be no difficulty in this regard and he told me he would do a paper on it. This is central to the situation. Before the matter comes before the House again in the form of a motion or otherwise, I urge that this issue be fully clarified by the Government.The Minister of State referred to conflicting legal advice. It would be helpful if copies of such advice were made available to the Opposition, which is trying to deal with this issue in a constructive manner. While the Minister has batted well for the Government, I do not think the issue of compellability has been or is capable of being teased out in this short time. The issue of compellability for anybody post-Abbeylara is open to argument. Following from that, there are still open questions if we are talking about a judge being compelled to come before a committee where it involves giving evidence, producing documents and being liable for an offence for failure to so do, where the evidence and the documents could effectively incriminate him or her. I am concerned about the issue of due process. As far as I am concerned, judges should not be above the law or below the law. I accept their special position of judicial independence because of the separation of powers. However, in fundamental constitutional rights, a judge is not a lesser being than any other citizen of this country.

Due process applies equally to everybody.I accept the comment from the Minister of State on the Special Criminal Court. On the issue of the compellability, the Minister of State stated that compellability of judges only applies in relation to an issue of impeachment, as outlined in Article 35.4.1°. We probably do not need this legislation, because presumably a judge will volunteer to come forward. One is only compelled when one does not come forward voluntarily. On an issue such as this, justice cannot be promoted properly when the key witnesses can choose how they wish to deal with a committee of the Oireachtas.What is the position, should the committee decide that it wishes the Attorney General or-and the Director of Public Prosecutions to attend and they say no, because they are not bound by the legislation?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	142	There were different views as to whether it was necessary, but it brings certainty and clarity to a process which may have to be undertaken. The admissibility of evidence for the committee would obviously be a matter for the committee. In the event of such a committee being established, the committee would have its own legal advice, and it would be inappropriate to comment outside that. It will not be possible for the committee to compel either the DPP or the Attorney General because they are specifically exempted, as are all judges except those who are the subject of such a process. It would be hard to envisage a situation where they would be needed to be compelled. Deputy Costello is right, a judge who is the subject of a process may well want to come in voluntarily before an investigation committee and he would not be required to do so before he would be given an opportunity to do so. This is only an enabling power for the committee to enable the Oireachtas to carry out its duties more effectively.

Currently, we are the seventh largest donor in percentage terms and well ahead of the EU average.The mission of the International Development Association, IDA, is to support efficient and effective programmes to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in the poorest member countries. The International Development Association helps build the human capital, policies, institutions and physical infrastructures needed to bring about equitable and sustainable growth. Its goal is to reduce the disparities across and within countries, to bring more people into the economic mainstream and to promote equitable access to the benefits of development, all highly laudable ambitions. The IDA is among a group of institutions specifically charged with responsibility for poverty reduction and promotion of growth and development. Today, nearly 3 billion people live on less than $2 a day and 1.1 billion live on less than €1 a day.Recently, as part of an international delegation of the parliamentary network of the World Bank, I visited the Yemen to witness poverty reduction strategies in action and to offer advice on our experience there of the operation of the poverty reduction strategy to the World Bank and the Yemeni Government. We visited two schemes — a water project and a health centre. These schemes had received these soft loans for which this Bill provides. The delegation was highly impressed by the two schemes largely because relatively small amounts of money were involved. I think the amount for both did not exceed $29,000, but they had a considerable effect on the population there. They were small measures — providing clean water and a small outreach health centre. They were particularly effective because the local population was required to have an input into them. The local population raised money and learned skills. It was not only a question of getting a hand out but more of a hand up. This Bill is designed to assist this type of initiative. It was self-evident how important and positive ownership of both projects by the local population was. We need to expand and extend this partnership approach.To this end, the EU faces an enormous challenge. The European Union is possibly the largest single donor in the world but to have an effect in the long term, radical change is needed to EU policy in dealing with the developing world. Trade policies and trade liberalisation are the key. This presents a particular challenge to agriculture policies but we must redress the imbalance that exists in the world where 1.1 billion people live on less than $1 a day. It is this area of trade and EU trade policy that we need to change. The average EU cow enjoys a subsidy of approximately €1 a day which is much more than is given in development and to human beings. We need to look at that issue. It is not a sustainable position that cows are valued more highly than people.Change is coming but it is far too slow. As Kofi Annan said, the poor in the world are poor not because there is too much globalisation but rather because there is not enough. This Bill enables the Government to continue its generous support for overseas development aid and to further the steps along the road to reach its stated commitment of 0.7% of GDP by 2007. I commend the Bill to the House.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	145	This Bill was first in the House approximately five months ago. I was about to speak on it but the debate was adjourned. I had a speech prepared on how we should use our EU Presidency as an opportunity to promote a development agenda. Five months later, I am finally getting to speak on the Bill but, unfortunately, our EU Presidency is drawing to a close. Some of the comments I might have made are no longer appropriate.To a certain extent, we have missed an opportunity in our Presidency of the European Union. Deputy Fiona O'Malley is correct in that we have a reputation for being internationally generous having worked in many areas of the Third World. Our reputation is particularly high at the moment because the Taoiseach has given an absolute commitment that this country will reach 0.7% of GNP in terms of development aid. If we are to do that and if an absolute commitment means anything, we must start now; we cannot wait for the final year of such a programme. For that money to be used effectively, it must be planned in a three or five year budgetary process so that if we give money, we can ensure it is spent properly.I am deeply concerned that the absolute commitment given by the Taoiseach does not seem to be bearing out in reality. Perhaps the Minister for Finance does not share that commitment because our budget does not show a gradual increase in the level of development aid to the international development aid programme in a manner which would indicate that we are serious about fulfilling that absolute commitment. It is a lost opportunity and about which I am critical of the Government. While I welcome this Bill and our allocation of moneys to this thirteenth funding allocation to the International Development Association, we must ask the bigger questions, what will we do and what is our role in international society in this regard?Our EU Presidency is a failed one as a result of not taking on this agenda. We heard much about competitiveness in the Lisbon agenda but we have not put at the core of our message the achievement of the millennium goals which should have been the focus of our Presidency because coming from this country, it would have been noticed. We have a unique international position. While being part of the developed and wealthy western world, we are seen internationally as having an independent voice and as being a country which recognises the true sense of globalisation — that we are living in one world and that it is not a world of two halves, as Jim Wolfensohn, the head of the World Bank, said.I refer to the current debate surrounding globalisation. We tend to see people from parties such as mine as being anti-globalisation. I would dispute that and agree with Deputy Fiona O'Malley that we need more globalisation and not less. The real question is, what type of globalisation? People say the anti-globalisation movement says this, that and the other but it may be better termed as the movement for globalised justice because we are looking for justice in globalisation. To achieve justice in globalisation, the first step must be to address the institutions which administer and manage some of the forums of globalised commerce, trade and development aid. In that regard, we are particularly critical of the structures within the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund which, critics of the existing globalisation system rightly point out, are part of the problem rather than part of the solution in this area.I regret the European Union — maybe we could have taken a lead on this — does not take a strong or a united stance in regard to the management and future structures of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, in particular. The EU has a strong common position in World Trade Organisation negotiations but there is not the same sense of exactly what the European Union position is in regard to the development of the IMF and the World Bank which need to be reformed. It is 60 years since the Bretton Woods institutions, including the World Bank, were set up. Anyone with a fair mind would not argue that the decision making structures within those two organisations are fair and treat the developing world in the correct fashion. Some might ask what that has to do with people here and that these are lofty aspirations and this is idealistic talk. Since we live in a globalised, connected, united and monetary world, it is in our interests, as much as that of the developing areas, to get those institutions right and to get them working in a just, fair and efficient manner.I will give an example of how the incompetence in the management and administration of these institutions is having an effect on us. We are seeing a world monetary system with a significant debt problem. That debt problem is not what the public might see it as, namely, Third World developing countries with huge debts, which they do, but rather that the largest debt in the world is that of the US Government. It is currently running a massive budget deficit which it is funding through the issuing of bonds which are largely bought by the poorest developing countries in the world because the US dollar is held as a reserve currency.We should listen to people who are critics of this international system because they may see behind some of the great bravado or confidence in the international capitalist market system and see the flaws, which are increasingly evident. At present the great debt issue is really that of massive US debt in the form of US bonds held by developing countries as their only reserve currency, since they cannot hold gold or other reserves. They get a small amount of interest from them but borrow significant amounts at a much higher rate from independent banks. At the same time they are paying interest rates of 15% to 18% on loans they have taken out with international banks, while their yield on US bonds is 3% to 5%. That is one of the realities in the current global capitalist system and it is an extremely dangerous situation. The US Government is borrowing from the rest of the world to pay for its population's present consumption patterns. That will surely come to an end, and when that happens, we will see a decline in the value of the US dollar. We may already have started to see the early stages of it.People will realise that those bonds are not worth what they thought they were. US interest rates will rise to try to maintain that flow of revenue into the United States of America to pay for its consumption patterns. In our globalised world, after the next election there will be a US Government which has a massive budget deficit. We always start considering financial prudence after an election. It will have to cut back its budget deficit. Some time in the middle of next year, we may be facing a situation where there is a declining dollar, increasing interest rates and a deficit coming through. We live in a globalised market and follow what happens on Wall Street just as surely as we used to follow what happened in London. That sets the tone for us and the international markets. In such a situation, there would be a deflationary world economy, with less investment coming into Ireland, higher interest rates and an Irish economy which has borrowed massively. Irish citizens on the streets, who might then be in a contracting economy with rising interest rates, would be caught.If we examine development issues and how we structure international financial institutions, it is not merely for the sake of the poor of the world. We all live in the same world, and having a stable, efficient, fair and just monetary system is part of that. At present, institutions such as the World Bank are not fair in the way they make decisions. They are dominated by what is known as "Washington consensus" thinking and people who believe the same as George Bush — that their market values will dominate for ever and a day. I do not believe they are right and we should start listening to some of the critics of that system who can point out the flaws to those who have faith in it. I hope I am wrong in that prognosis but it is worth discussing.I wish we had more debates on that global vision and perspective. I could speak for longer but I am keen to share my time with Deputy Cowley. Like Deputy Fiona O'Malley, I commend this Bill to the House. It is certainly welcome that we are putting this money into an international institution for use as loans. Poor and developing countries may now be able to replace some of those US bond or merchant bank borrowings. This House must direct far more attention and debate on what is really happening in the global financial markets and what we should be doing to send a message of how the world should be governed and managed. The current situation in the IMF and the World Bank is not one with which we are happy on this side of the House.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I come here to talk about problems in my own area and those of the people who elected me to Dáil Éireann. We have major problems, but we must also view matters in a more global context. Before coming here, I was on Radio Waterford talking about the lack of a radiotherapy unit there. The interviewer said to me that there were no votes in it and asked me why I was doing it. I said to her that I was doing it because I believed in it and because it was very important. The Minister was supposed to come in this morning to talk to us about the radiotherapy report, but he did not turn up, since he has gone to the Continent. His job is at home in Ireland and he should look after Ireland first. He promised to attend but did not do so.Having said that, on some occasions we must take a broader view. I am very proud to stand here and talk about this Bill, since it is doing something that we should be doing. I know we have made certain commitments, along with many other nations. By 2007, we are supposed to be dedicating 0.7% of our GNP to overseas aid. That is a very important and laudable thing and we should be doing it. Other countries may not have been as good as us, though, even donating 0.4% of GNP, we are not as good as we should be. At the same time, we are making an effort. However, there has been a freeze on that money and that is both lamentable and regrettable. The Government should get on track.In Ireland, the island of saints and scholars, we always had something for someone else. In my area of the country, it is called a meitheal. There was always something there for the neighbour. Though times were hard, people helped each other by sharing what they had, even though it was very little. In our economy, now the fourth richest in the world, if we do not have money for our less well-off brethren, who does? That is something that we should be proud to do, and that is why I am very happy to speak on this Bill.There are other issues surrounding this Bill. It may be seen as a hand-out encouraging the wrong mentality, with the result that people feel it is better to give something requiring repayments. That is part of the equation and it is part of the work of the IDA to give money, but with a repayment commitment. That allows it to give even more, since the money comes back again, and it is very important that that happens. However, AIDS and some other transmittable diseases are not a problem for us compared with Africa, where AIDS is the biggest killer. To people there, HIV-AIDS is extremely important, and it must be addressed. We know what is going on, so we have an obligation to try to help out in that regard.When one thinks about it, the world is a small place and travel has made it smaller still. People go to bed hungry and die of TB and AIDS. Millions die of malaria, polio and so on, while others lack basic social services and adequate running water. Money is available for international help but the completely preventable war in Iraq, which should not have happened, has meant there are competing needs for funds, such as the rebuilding of that country. We have got things very wrong regarding what we should be doing. Ireland has a great opportunity as holder of the EU Presidency to give some direction in all this. "Make love, not war" was the catchphrase in the old San Francisco days, but perhaps that should have been remembered in this House when we aided and abetted the USA in going into Iraq and doing such damage.We have a very proud record of helping one another and that is why I support this Bill. We are doing something of which we can be proud. Let us consider the terrible problems. I mentioned the idea of a grant versus a loan. The old saying is that, if one gives a man a fish, one feeds him for a day, but if one teaches him to fish, one feeds him for life. That is very much taken on board. There has been a debate about whether this money should be used for public projects such as social services, AIDS prevention and so on, or to give a hand-up to small companies which could boost their economies by being viable themselves. When one considers the number of people living on less than $1 a day in the world, it seems ludicrous that some countries have so much while others have so little. The World Bank has 184 member nations and they should be able to contribute globally to much greater effect than at present. There were 98 new cases of polio in 2002. Nigeria is the most polio-endemic country in Africa. These diseases should not be found in those countries. If the world was right all these diseases would be eliminated because the means exist to tackle them. I know there is major support for education.Education is very important, and almost half of the children in Africa and one quarter of those in south and west Asia are not in education. If people do not have a basic education, where can they go? These are all major problems that require proper solutions.The AIDS problem in Africa has to be considered. In the 19th century the means were not available to deal with those diseases. Nothing could be done about them. Science and knowledge were inadequate and this prevented lives from being saved. However, now that the necessary science and technology exist, we must face the reality that we do not care enough. There is a major input to be made. While there is as yet no vaccine for AIDS, one might well be developed. Extra expenditure on vaccines in general, however, could save an extra 2 million lives a year.It must be remembered that these are people like ourselves, with needs, who go to bed hungry at night and die of these diseases. Think of the life expectancy for the AIDS victim and the problems people have. Is it right that their problems are so acute? In sub-Saharan Africa life expectancy peaked at 49 years in the 1980s and is projected to fall to just under 46 years by 2005. Everyone in this Chamber would be dead if they lived in sub-Saharan Africa, such is the life expectancy there. That is shocking.An estimated 2.2 million HIV positive women give birth every year. There are currently about 14 million HIV-AIDS orphans in the world, most of them in Africa, and that figure is expected to reach 25 million by 2010. By then up to 25% of the children in some sub-Saharan countries will be orphans. Think about it. Prophylactic treatment and anti-retrovirals in combination with other interventions have almost entirely eliminated HIV infection in infants in industrialised countries. In other words, we can reverse all this. We can virtually eliminate this in our own country with money, but when it is not there, people just die.The risk of HIV transmission in infants in developing countries where breast feeding is the norm can be reduced by more than 50% in mothers receiving short courses of anti-retroviral therapy. Almost six million people in developing countries need anti-retroviral therapy, but only about 400,000 of them received it in 2003. It is obvious that there is much to be done in light of these statistics, and it is possible. Early intervention can solve the problem. There is a great lesson in that for Africa. Senegal, for instance, began its anti-AIDS programme in 1986 before the virus had got a proper grip on the population, and it has managed to keep its infection rate below 2%. Uganda began its programme early in the 1990s when 40% of the adult population was already infected. Now that figure is down to 8% and falling. The disease has been stopped in its tracks in those countries.In other countries, however, such as Botswana, the incidence is extremely high, with 38.8% of the population infected with HIV-AIDS. When one thinks of it like that one realises there are so many problems and so much to be done. I welcome this Bill. It is a step in the right direction, but we should be doing much more.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I would like to share my time with Deputy Paul McGrath.Fine Gael welcomes the Bill. Any provision that channels €50 million to the poorest nations and peoples in the world must be welcomed in principle. There has been considerable debate over a number of years on how this money is being spent. A visible split exists between the United States and Europe over the question of loans or grant aid. This argument is futile as the countries who receive this money are the poorest in the world and the difference between loans and grants is minimal in most cases.Many countries and aid organisations have questioned the way this money is disposed of. In many instances it is difficult to see real and concrete results. The fact that this fund is controlled by the World Bank means that from time to time its disposal is unduly influenced by powerful industrial countries such as the United States, particularly under George Bush and an extremely conservative Republican party. This is in spite of the fact that the US contributes less of its GDP than most other developed countries.Ireland has changed the emphasis of its overseas aid budget since 1998. This was a direct result of a change in policy by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, when his officials pledged £20 million to the International Development Association, IDA. The Irish pledge in Copenhagen at that time played a major part in encouraging other countries to make generous offers and marked a major shift in Irish policy. At the same time the Minister was planning cuts in our overseas budget for traditional aid agencies. Even the then Progressive Democrats Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, who was in charge of overseas aid, threatened to resign at that time if more funds were not made available for State-run Irish aid projects and programmes run by aid agencies, NGOs and missionaries.Recent Ministers of State in charge of overseas aid are to be complimented on doing an excellent job to encourage and assist NGOs and missionaries to achieve valuable results from Irish-run programmes — Deputy O'Donnell and the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, are highly regarded by Irish aid agencies, NGOs and missionaries. However, I am concerned about the change in emphasis being pursued by the current Minister for Finance. This Minister, as we know, likes to associate and play along with his conservative friends in the US and other right wing Governments. It is unfortunate that aid given by the developed nations will have little impact unless some basic and fundamental changes are made. All the cards are stacked against the developing countries — political instability and in particular lack of educational opportunities.In that context when the current round of funding to the IDA was agreed, the most significant long-term breakthrough was the pledge at Halifax to support those developing countries in particular with credible education plans and strong policy commitments. The first steps are at least being taken towards an international budget to help fast-track primary education. Education is the best anti-poverty panacea and social and economic development strategy. It is fundamental for strengthening political structures and achieving sustained growth. Some 113 million in the world do not have access to education of any description. Almost half the children in Africa and one quarter of those in Asia are totally deprived of proper fundamental education.The developing countries have signed up to the United Nations' millennium development goal which provides that every child will have a chance to go to school, by 2015. If this goal is to be achieved the international community must raise its financial contribution for education in the poorest countries. As well as aid, whether in loans or grants, there must be a major change in the attitude of developed countries towards trade talks. This issue was discussed at length in this House before the world trade talks in Cancún. The last round of international trade negotiations left the 40 poorest countries €600 million a year worse off. Grant aid or loans are of little benefit if this is the payback demanded by the world trade talks.Any contribution to the World Bank raises questions about the policies this agency pursues in developing countries. In the past, the bank, dominated by the influence of mostly conservative industrial nations had a simplistic blind faith in free market economy which may have helped countries with good infrastructure but was of little good in the poorest of countries where the most basic facilities are not available. It is dangerous, however, to run hard on issues such as privatisation, opting immediately for a market-based pricing without any real regard for its effect on that society. The ideological stance of the World Bank, driven by the US pushing for a capital market and a free market liberalisation at a furious pace, is at least questionable.Many NGOs blame the World Bank to a large extent for perpetuating poverty in underdeveloped countries. Imposing an economic model based on western developmental thinking on those countries was in many cases totally unsuitable. Developing countries must decide for themselves what best suits their needs regardless of outside influence from the World Bank and its policy makers and the highly developed western economies can cause some damage in this context. Poor countries must be represented and given some clout at the WTO talks. While international aid is vital, an even playing pitch for trade is needed. In the long term it is in everyone's interest to build a more stable world with less poverty. This stability must be built on everybody having a stake in the success of world economics and social development. There is clear evidence that in the past two years global determination to address global poverty has declined. Billions of dollars have been spent on wars and fighting terrorism yet until recently many world leaders did not see that poverty breeds discontent and educational disadvantage gives opportunities to terrorist organisations to recruit. Despite these facts the United States has only recently begun to realise the connection but its Government's message still emphasises free trade even more than the aid that is required.This is a small move in the right direction and there is no doubt that the rich countries' millennium pledge to halve extreme poverty levels by 2015 has been given new impetus by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001. This brought home, not least to the United States, the link between poverty and terrorism which is so easily bred by economic and social despair. Even President Bush acknowledges that the stakes could not be higher. Poverty, hopelessness, lack of education and failed governments often allow conditions for terrorism to flourish. I hope there is the realisation that global security depends on bringing relief to the 1.2 billion people who live in what is officially defined as extreme poverty, on $1 a day or less. Wages must be tackled. Most of us are aware of the new Olympic campaign launched to emphasise the difference in wages between Third World countries and the developing countries. Sportswear produced for €8 in developing countries is sold for up to €200 in shops in the West. Some equality must be introduced in the wage market, and the wage structure throughout the world must be revolutionised. The new global economy allows multinationals to move operations overnight to cheaper economies where they can exploit a very vulnerable work force, at the same time rendering unemployed many low-paid workers in developing countries. Some kind of tax equalisation system must be introduced to deal with this.There has been a significant change in Irish Government policy in recent years. A great deal of work is required to persuade the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation that there must be a change of emphasis. We cannot always look for a pay-off for the grants or concessions we give to the Third World countries and if in our capacity as President of the European Community we cannot convey that message strongly and effectively to the rest of the developed countries we should re-assess how we distribute our aid. Maybe we should look again at giving this money to our NGOs and our projects abroad rather than pour it into the World Bank which is over-influenced by ideological considerations.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the International Development Association (Amendment) Bill. Like the other speakers I welcome the Bill but find it strange that it was introduced in December 2003 and Second Stage commenced then yet there has been no rush to bring it through since then. The explanatory memorandum circulated with this Bill indicated that it was intended that the money be paid over to this organisation by the end of 2003. If that is the case why has it taken a further six months to resume Second Stage? Why did it not come forward earlier and why was the money not paid over? If there was an urgency on it in December why was that not carried through?I sometimes question this Government's commitment to overseas aid. We heard a great deal of fancy talk about what it would do and it gave a firm commitment in the programme for Government that by 2007 it would reach the target contribution of 0.7% of gross national product which seemed a very commendable aim. However, we see what has happened in the meantime, since the Government set out on this road. In 1998 it contributed 0.27% of GNP to overseas aid. That increased by 0.04% the following year but the year after that it dipped. Between 1999 and 2000 the percentage of aid dropped by 0.02%. Then it increased by 0.04% but that did not make up the 0.04% that it had lost. The then Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, kicked up a row about the level of development aid contributed by the Government and rightly set a marker in the sand demanding that the money be put back on stream again. Unfortunately, she is not a part of this Government and is not in a position to put down a marker again. Maybe the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who is with us today will kick up a rumpus about this to achieve the 0.7% of GNP  target set by this partnership when it went into Government. To do that the Government must take dramatic steps over the next two years because it is now at 0.41% having risen over five years from 0.27%. I am not sure that this Government is committed to achieving this.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Three billion people in the world live on less than $2 a day. That figure is almost seven or eight times the total population of the European Union. A total of 1.1 billion people live on less than $1 a day. We need to give money to poorer countries and help them in whatever way we can. I re-echo what was said by my colleague, Deputy Murphy, that we should pour money into the tried and tested systems of NGOs and missionaries. I had the privilege of visiting a family member in a missionary country a number of years ago where impressive work had been done in developing schools and so on in small villages with little aid from this part of the world. We should direct far more of our overseas aid to those agencies, rather than employing people to assess such projects on the ground at great cost due to the level of bureaucracy involved.In view of the upcoming trade talks I wish to focus on the Fair Trade organisation which was set up by the Christian churches. It endorses products where a fair price is paid for a fair day's work in poorer countries. It is shocking to think that if one has a cappuccino downtown at a cost of €2.50, only 3 cent of the price goes to the producer of the coffee beans. There is a significant discrepancy in the price paid to producers and that paid by consumers. We should educate people about Fair Trade practices and encourage people to buy Fair Trade products. In purchasing them, we send additional help back to the communities producing these goods. It is a fair way of doing business.I urge the Minister of State to bring this matter to the attention of Government. Perhaps he can also promote the use of Fair Trade products in the Office of Public Works, for example, in the choice of tea and coffee used. If we all did that, it would be a way of contributing additional aid to those poorer countries. I commend the Fair Trade organisation for its work in raising awareness. I hope the Government will take note of what it is doing and encourage people to follow suit.

In keeping with our commitment to fully inclusive fora, we support the proposition that the UN Economic and Social Council should be strengthened so it can have a greater role in global economic governance and in democratising the fundamentally unjust global economic order.Sinn Féin seeks to build a united Ireland that would commit itself to achieving greater global, political and economic equality. We are also committed to fully-inclusive international fora that are animated by the principles of openness and respect. It is clear the IMF and the World Bank do not have those characteristics. While we support the passage of the Bill and do not wish to hold it up, we are not uncritical.At the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis earlier this year, a motion which I sponsored was adopted that asserted the achievement of the UN millennium development goals for 2015 must be brought to the top of the international agenda, as a necessary step towards a more equitable and just global social order. The Ard-Fheis also recognised that, as the largest trade and aid bloc in the world, the EU is a key player in meeting the millennium development goals. We called on the Government, not only to fulfil its responsibilities in this regard by fully implementing the Barcelona commitments towards meeting the millennium development goals at home, but also to actively persuade its EU partners to make this a top priority. This should have been one of the top priorities for the Irish Presidency of the European Union. Although only one month of the Presidency remains, I repeat the call to place the issue at the top of the agenda. We can also influence the next Presidency, that of the Netherlands, in the Troika. I appeal to the Government, even at this late stage, to ensure this becomes one of the primary items on the agenda of the EU for the coming years.At successive Ard-Fheiseanna over the past decade, Sinn Féin has repeatedly called for complete debt cancellation in the developing world as the only means of facilitating greater economic equality and growth for developing countries. We strongly reiterate that demand and call on the Government to promote this policy domestically and internationally. We are not seeking a moratorium, we advocate total and complete debt cancellation. That is the only way to address the major inequity in the world. During our Presidency of the EU, the Government should have used its influence to ensure the current commitments to debt cancellation were matched by its EU partners, in particular the creditor countries.The Twenty-six Counties State is now the fourth wealthiest in the world and several of our European neighbours have met or exceeded the official UN development assistance target of 0.7% of GNP. Sinn Féin reiterates its urgent call on the Government to make a multiannual commitment to incremental annual ODA increases in order to meet its commitment to reach the UN target by 2007. Sinn Féin endorses the Dóchas and Development Co-operation Ireland recommendation to ring-fence ODA increases in the following increments: 0.48% in 2004, which I do not think we will achieve; 0.5% in 2005; 0.62% in 2006; and 0.7% in 2007. As one of the world's wealthiest nations, that is the least that can be expected of Ireland.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 has proven to be one of the most effective measures against the sexual exploitation of children in Europe in recent years. It has been widely studied by Members of Parliaments in other jurisdictions as a model law in child protection.We must be particularly sensitive to issues surrounding child pornography. For that reason, the intricacies of the 1998 Act have come under closer scrutiny than ever before. One of the concerns that exists about the Act is that it might have the effect of constraining — or even rendering criminal — legitimate investigations by committees of the Oireachtas into matters relating to child pornography. It might also have the effect of restricting the level of co-operation between Houses of the Oireachtas, or committees thereof, and persons from whom co-operation is desired.In this regard, concern arises in the first instance because possession of child pornography is one of the criminal offences established by the Act. This would mean that, on the face of it, anyone who comes into possession of child pornography for the purposes of legitimate inquiry or investigation would themselves be guilty of that same offence. The Oireachtas, in its wisdom, anticipated this problem and avoided it in most circumstances by providing, at section 6(2) of the 1998 Act, that the Act does not apply to persons who possess child pornography: in the exercise of functions under the Censorship of Films Acts, the Censorship of Publications Acts and the Video Recordings Acts; or for the purpose of the prevention, investigation of prosecution of offences under the Act. This means, for example, that members of the Garda Síochána who may be investigating child pornography offences can take possession of child pornography without fear of themselves being guilty of an offence.As the law now stands, no exemption of this nature extends to Members of the Oireachtas who may come into possession of child pornography as a consequence of carrying out their proper functions. This creates the anomalous situation that, should a House of the Oireachtas, or any committee thereof, desire to gather evidence in respect of any matter relating to child pornography, any Member who came into possession of such pornography might technically be committing a criminal offence. Any civil servant or legal adviser assisting in such an investigation would similarly be committing an offence if they came into possession of child pornography in the course of their legitimate functions.Similar concerns would arise in regard to the offences of publication or printing of child pornography, which might theoretically expose to prosecution a person who only published or printed the material in question in the course of legitimately carrying out a function of the Oireachtas. Clearly this would not be a tolerable position in which to place any Deputy, Senator or official.A further difficulty stems from section 5 of the 1998 Act, which makes it an offence to distribute child pornography. At section 5(2), distribution is defined as including the parting of possession with child pornography. This would lead to a situation where a person, who is or might be in possession of child pornography, might refuse to hand over to the Oireachtas either the child pornography itself or computers on which the child pornography is or may be stored, such a person might possess the material innocently. If, for example, he or she owned a computer on to which some third party had downloaded child pornography, such a person might not even be certain that the material in question is child pornography at all within the legal meaning of that phrase. However, regardless of whether he or she possessed the pornography innocently or otherwise, that person might well refuse to co-operate with an investigation or inquiry by the Oireachtas because, in doing so, he or she might run the risk of committing a criminal offence.The solution we propose for this problem is to insert a new section 13 into the 1998 Act which will ensure that nothing in that Act shall prevent either: the making or compliance with a direction under section 3 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997, as amended: or the possession, distribution, printing or publication by either House of the Oireachtas, a committee — within the meaning of that Act — or any person of child pornography for the purposes of, or in connection with, the performance of any function conferred by the Constitution or by law on those Houses or conferred by a resolution of either of those Houses or resolutions of both of them on such a committee.The Bill will permit Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, together with any appropriate officials and advisers, to carry out their appropriate functions in circumstances where issues relating to child pornography might be involved. It will also clear the way for third parties to hand over relevant evidence without fear of being prosecuted merely for giving the material over and it will prevent such third parties from relying on the provisions of the 1998 Act in order to refuse to co-operate with the Houses of the Oireachtas or any committee thereof.This is a simple and straightforward measure and I commend it to the House.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	167	This legislation had not even been mentioned until last evening as being part of the process being put in place in respect of the current controversy about Judge Curtin. I had a full meeting with the Attorney General last week and this legislation was not mentioned. I had a full meeting with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on Tuesday night last and it was not mentioned. The first I heard about this proposal was at 5 p.m. yesterday. This is no way to deal with legislation and it is a recipe for making bad legislation.I would love to be in a position to give a considered view on the legislation but unfortunately I cannot do so. I have only just read the legislation having earlier today been involved in the debate on the other item of rushed legislation. What is the rush? Why not deal with the legislation next week, by which time Members would have had time for some considered reflection on it? I raised this issue earlier and I was not given a reasonable response other than that there is a job to be done. What is the nature of that job? It is to deal with a particular individual in what should be a calm, reflective way. I question the basis on which it has been dealt with by the Government. This is "ad hockery" at its worst.The Government's culpability in not putting in place measures during the past five years, long before this issue arose, is further heightened by its rushing the Bill through and not giving the Oireachtas, which the legislation is supposed to serve and help, sufficient time to adequately reflect on the consequences involved. That is the wrong way to deal with legislation and it is a recipe for difficulty and possible failure. If such an eventuality comes to pass, it will be the sole responsibility of the Government which has been utterly incompetent in dealing with this issue in general and which is guilty of the most gross "ad hockery" regarding the way in which the legislation is being dealt with.As spokesperson for the main Opposition party, Fine Gael, I committed myself to co-operate with the Government in terms of trying to ensure that proper steps would be taken. From that point of view, I do not feel the legislation can be opposed at this stage. However, my lack of opposition to it is solely based on the fast and full responsibility of the Government for it, the Bill taken earlier and all aspects of the procedure proposed in respect of the current controversy about Judge Curtin.As regards its substance, the legislation is designed for a particular purpose which cannot be avoided, namely, to ensure that members of a committee proposed to be established by the Houses to deal with the issue under Article 35 will, without fear of prosecution in carrying out their duties on such committee, be able to view certain items of child pornography.Let us be blunt, about what child pornography are we talking? We are discussing child pornography in respect of which major issues of admissibility arise. In discussing the question of admissibility, the Government should have taken the opportunity to deal with the issues of admissibility relating to that particular child pornography. The committee will not be able to see it unless it is admissible and huge issues have been raised with regard to its admissibility on the basis that it is constitutionally tainted. I merely make the point at this stage as this is not an issue which will be resolved now. It will be the responsibility of the Government before this process is completed to clarify and deal with those issues about which, I am sure, there are conflicting legal opinions. Basically, what we are talking about with regard to this Bill cannot arise unless the evidence is admissible.Some questions I would like to raise might be more appropriate to Committee Stage of the Bill. However, I will raise them with the Minister of State now. Is the Bill as proposed sufficiently clear to cover the position not just of members of the committee but of all those associated with it? These could include legal advisers, staff and experts called in to advise the committee. This is an issue that should be clarified. It is an issue which caught my eye on first glance at the Bill. Perhaps the reference to "or any person" may cover these people. The issue should be clarified.Defects in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 were signalled long ago. Section 3 of the Bill leaves a wide open loophole with regard to the offence known as "grooming". The Act was enacted before the practice of Internet grooming became as widespread as it is today and was not specifically designed to cover that dreadful practice. As it stands, section 3 makes it an offence for an adult to arrange for a child to travel for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The Act was specifically drafted to deal with child trafficking and does not cover a situation where a child is not coerced into meeting a predatory adult. In legal terms, under the existing Act coercion of the child is a necessary element to make exploitation an offence. It is unacceptable for us as a society to leave this loophole as it is. There have been some high profile cases on this issue in the United Kingdom recently. As it stands section 3 of the Act is outdated and does not adequately cover the practice of Internet grooming.I raise this issue because we are dealing as a matter of urgency with an issue under the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. We are amending that Act. Why then do we not deal with the obvious loophole in it, which has been drawn to the Government's attention on a number of occasions? Why is the opportunity not taken to close that loophole? It would be simple to do so. If the Minister of State was willing to accept an amendment, I would propose one. A further indication of the unholy rush involved is that an obvious loophole, to which attention has been drawn, is being left open while we rush through all Stages of a Bill that deals with this Act. If I had been given the opportunity to discuss the Bill in detail before it was circulated — that would probably have to have been before dawn this morning — I would have suggested that we should deal with this Bill next week and use the opportunity, in the interest of children, to close the loophole to which I referred. This is another example of the downside to rushing through legislation. This example is of omission from the proposed Bill of an area with which we could and should have dealt.I am not certain the provision before the House deals with the problem arising from the current controversy. I have not had sufficient opportunity to give careful reflection to the Bill or to take advice on it. Therefore I will not give it my full approval but put my concerns on the record of the House. This Bill is just one part of the rushed strategy being put in place, for which the Government must take full and complete responsibility, and on the basis it does so, I will not oppose the Bill.

I reiterate, as I did with the previous legislation, that the Labour Party is unhappy with the manner in which both items of legislation are being rushed through both Houses. It is unusual to put emergency legislation through both Houses on one day and highly unusual that two items of legislation are being dealt with in that way. Nobody, not even the most optimistic Minister, could suggest that this provides adequate time for scrutiny of the possible implications and intricacies that bedevil legislation. Even if these Bills are only short amending Bills, they have far-flung consequences and implications.There was no need to rush this legislation as it is not necessary for it to go through at this time. It is the type of belt and braces legislation that is probably unnecessary. The Minister of State said in his address that members might be technically deemed to be committing a criminal offence but once they are acting in a legal capacity and for a legal purpose, they will be excused as the exemption is likely to apply. As far as I can gather that is the legal advice.Therefore, this Bill is merely precautionary legislation that may or may not come into play with regard to matters to be dealt with in due course. For that reason it should not be before us today. It should be left for another day to give us adequate time to scrutinise it, to allow us time for reflection and proper analysis of the parent legislation it amends, the 1997 Act, and to see its implications. When an amendment is grafted on to legislation — this one is substantial — it can affect the balance of the legislation. We do not know for sure whether that is the case and the Minister of State might elaborate on how the entirety of the legislation, as amended, will operate. We are processing this legislation at the wrong time and we may not even need to do so. Perhaps we could get a further statement on the necessity for its introduction at short notice or for its introduction at all. The purpose of the Bill is to allow for the possession, distribution, printing, publication or showing of child pornography to a committee or a person for constitutional purposes and it applies not only to Members of the two Houses but also to the officials who may be engaged with the committees.The question must be asked as to why this legislation is before us. What are the circumstances in which a committee of the Houses is likely to peruse material of this nature? Is there a current situation that is pertinent to our discussions? It is intended that a specific committee will be established under a number of motions, which we have been given to understand will be presented to both Houses next week, and a particular course of action will be embarked upon.One of the points made, to which I would like the Minister of State to respond, is the admissibility of material declared inadmissible in a court of law. Is the view of the Government, the Attorney General and the Minister that evidence ruled out by a court of law because it was deemed to have been unconstitutionally obtained can nonetheless be deemed admissible in an Oireachtas hearing? Is it central to the Government's case that evidence thrown out of court on the basis that it was secured on foot of a spent warrant could be presented to a committee of the Houses behind closed doors? If that evidence is not admissible before a committee, is a central plank of the case against a named judge on grounds of misbehaviour likely to be removed? That will be a matter for the proposed committee, when established — I am sure it will have legal advice available to it — and it will decide whether it believes the evidence obtained in those circumstances is admissible. That would be a decision of each member of the committee. Prior to getting that far down the road, it would be relevant for the House to hear the views of the Government on this matter. If it is envisaged that a committee will hear evidence of this nature, we would like to hear how the Government intends to disport itself in regard to that evidence.As Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said, the principal Act, even in the short space of time it has been in existence, some six years, is somewhat outdated. It does not seem to have envisaged the operation of the Internet, chat rooms or the extent to which the Internet is and can be used for the distribution, availability and accessibility of pornography, including child pornography. That is an area that could also be addressed. While this is a short and precise Bill for a particular purpose, it could have been an opportunity to address the parent legislation so it conformed to current needs to ensure it would be realistic, appropriate and pertinent.I am not in any way opposing the legislation, but I would like to hear proper justification from the Minister of State as to why it is before us, the reason it is necessary to pass it and whether there is full agreement by the Government advisers on the necessity for it.

Before I go into the details of the Bill, it is important that all Members keep a clear head, deal with the facts and seriously consider the problem of child trafficking and child pornography. I express concern about any legislation that is rushed through this House. We are entering a legal minefield on these issues and that is why I raise these concerns. We all want our justice system to work. We all want fairness and due process. We are all against the abuse of children and child pornography. We all want well thought out legislation. I have concerns about the proposed legislation. Making it up as we go along should never be an option. I raise these issues to ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas are not undermined in any way.When dealing with the nightmare of child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children, a tough and determined position must be taken. These children are human beings; they are somebody's son or daughter whose innocence has been shattered and ruined forever by child pornography. This type of violence against children is their worst nightmare. It is an attack on their dignity, human rights and their right to live out their full lives as children. It is appropriate that the Minister of State with responsibility for children is present.A society that stays silent on child pornography or condones child trafficking loses its heart and soul and in the end that society falls apart. We should also remind ourselves that there would be no child pornography industry if it were not for adults. Adults generate the market and develop the abuse. This is a reality to which we must wake up. Internationally, millions of children are being sexually exploited each day. The sad aspect about many of the cases is that the children concerned come from very poor backgrounds or very poor countries or sadly in the case of the EU, including Ireland, they often come from chaotic and dysfunctional families. That is a reality with which we have to deal. Some children in this State who come from violent dysfunctional families end up on the streets involved in child prostitution and also find themselves at risk in other situations. That is happening in this State and is something to which we must waken up.We must ensure this legislation is tight and legally sound. Its purpose is to insert a new section into the 1998 Act. Section 1 amends the 1998 Act by inserting a new section. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that nothing in the 1998 Act shall prevent the giving of a direction by a committee of either or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas under section 3 of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, or compliance with such a direction, or the possession, distributing, printing, publication or showing by either House, a committee or any person, of child pornography in connection with the performance of the functions conferred on those Houses by the Constitution or by law, or on a committee by resolution of those Houses or a resolution of either House. These are the core issues in the legislation.Regarding our judicial systems and how we ensure justice is done, we will have to revisit the appointment procedures for judges. All political parties are deeply involved in this process and the public are extremely concerned about the jobs for the boys and girls syndrome. One should be appointed as a judge on merit, ability and integrity, not because one hangs out in the right political circles or supports the right political party. We have to face up to this reality, which is relevant to this debate. Since I was elected two years ago, I have been questioned on many occasions by citizens and taxpayers who have a lack of confidence in the level of justice in society. Many people feel alienated as a result of the perceived lack of justice.I wish to speak about the broader issue of child pornography. It is important that we bear in mind that there are other forms of pornography, such as so-called "soft porn" and lap-dancing clubs in which people are exploited. Regardless of the terms that are used to dress it up or make it sound reasonable, it is sexual exploitation. The fact that children are involved makes it more sinister. Belgium was ripped apart by a recent case on this issue. I call for a measured debate on the Bill.I would like to refer briefly to the recognition of the Independent group in the Dáil. Independent Members, who were democratically elected by the people, should be involved in all Oireachtas committees. We are members of the Technical Group but we should also be recognised in our own right. Recent opinion polls in Connacht and Munster have shown clearly that Independent candidates represent between 10% and 16% of the people. This mandate should be respected in the House and elsewhere. I criticise political commentators. The major parties should accept reality. When the membership of committees is being decided, Independent Members should be included in our own right. People must recognise that as Ireland develops, its political landscape continues to change.I support the Bill, but I urge people to listen to the concerns I have raised during today's debate. It is important that they do so. The Minister of State mentioned in his speech that the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 has proven to be one of the most effective measures taken in Europe in recent years as part of the struggle against the sexual exploitation of children. I welcome the Minister of State's correct assertion that the Act has been widely studied by politicians in Parliaments in other countries as a model of child protection. While it is important to have examples of good legislative practice to combat child pornography, it is also important to implement legislation and to ascertain whether it has delivered for children. That is the real test of quality legislation.We have to do something about the fact that the abuse is continuing. I have received many complaints from parents in recent weeks about television programmes, some of which are broadcast seven nights a week, that are not suitable for children. We have to examine such issues. The Minister of State rightly raises the possibility that a person might possess the material innocently, for example if a third party downloads child pornography on to his or her computer. We have to be vigilant about such cases.I disagree with the Minister of State's assertion that the Bill he is commending to the House is simple and straightforward. It is not as simple and straightforward as many people think. It is crucial that we have a cool, measured and calm debate on this matter. We should respond as legislators in a strong manner. I will support the Bill because we have to deal with the problem. We have a duty to ensure that the legislation we pass is of the highest class. We will not do victims any favours if the Bill is not of best quality and we will not do the judicial system any favours if we do not get this right. While I support this legislation, I ask the Minister of State to take on board my concerns about it.

We do not know enough, however, about many complex matters that are relevant to it. As Members of the Oireachtas, it is difficult for us to deal with such unknown matters. We do not know enough about individuals, information technology and financial transactions. Such subjects will have to be revisited at a future date. The Bill before the House is the subject of considerable unease, which primarily relates to the haste with which this legislation is proceeding. I received a draft copy of the Bill last night with hand-written amendments. I am worried when legislation is rushed.I have many questions about the Bill. I am not sure that Members of the Oireachtas should view the material mentioned in the legislation. I wonder if we could allow such viewing to be done by a third party, such as an expert witness who has an educational background with suitable qualifications that enable him or her to comment on such material. I am not sure whether Members of the Oireachtas are the best qualified people in that regard. If Members view such material, I hope they will be given expert advice in advance. When one considers the concerns that exist about the kind of material under discussion, it is possible that they may need counselling.There are complexities about the discussions on the material, how it will be transmitted electronically and how it might be paid for by financial transactions. We will need to get solid expert advice to comment or reach judgment on such issues. Expert witnesses will be required. We should consider ensuring that the proceedings will be held in camera. I wonder whether we might make reference to that in the Bill under consideration. It seems that any discussion of the material, as mentioned in the Bill, should take place in private. That issue needs to be considered. I am concerned about the issues that have been raised by the Bill. There may be a compelling case to move the legislation along swiftly, but I have yet to see evidence of the need to move as rapidly as we appear to be moving on this issue.I wish to address the wider issue of the appointment of people to positions of authority. The issue was raised by my colleague, Deputy Finian McGrath, who spoke about appointments to the Judiciary. The appointment of judges needs to be completely depoliticised. We have to ensure that judges receive adequate training. We should ensure that an adequate system of penalties is in place for members of the Judiciary who engage in behaviour that is unfitting of their office. I make these remarks in response to the points made by Deputy McGrath.I am concerned by the haste with which the Bill is being pursued. We should make some reference to the viewing of such material in camera. I am not convinced that Members of the Oireachtas should view such material directly. I hope it might be possible for expert witnesses with a professional background in this area to give us their views on such material.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	174	A number of points have been raised on Second Stage and it is important to note that the Attorney General advised the Government, as a matter of prudence, that this step should be taken. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe was concerned about the speed with which this legislation is being enacted. His concerns were echoed by Deputies Costello and Ó Snodaigh. The speed with which this matter is being dealt with is entirely connected with the fact that another step is imminent concerning a matter about which the Government has been in correspondence with a judge of the Circuit Court. The Attorney General has advised the Government that this measure is essential if the Oireachtas is to be in a position to exercise properly its functions and powers under constitutional and statute law. That is the reason for the rush. It is not a question of waiting for another few weeks to speculate on matters because the confidence that must exist in the Judiciary is one of the cornerstones of our democratic system. Throughout this episode, the Taoiseach and the Government have been most anxious to maintain the public confidence that must exist in the Judiciary, and to ensure that the Government wastes no time in taking the essential steps needed to advance the matter, which has been the subject of correspondence between the Government and the relevant Circuit Court judge.The legislation is drafted in abstract form and is of general application. It does not apply in any singular sense to the matter which we may have to consider in the weeks ahead. It seeks, rather, as a matter of general principle, to protect the position of the Houses, their committees and persons working on their behalf. That issue was raised in the course of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's contribution and it is quite clear the proposed section covers persons working on our behalf as well. The purpose of that is to ensure that the powers of the Houses, which are clearly delineated in the Constitution and in statute law, can be exercised if required.I appreciate the fact, to which Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and Deputy Cuffe referred, that notice of this measure has been very late, but I am sure Deputies will appreciate that the Attorney General has had to undertake a wide series of consultations in order to gather a great deal of advice. While similar motions have been introduced in the House before now, this is the first time since 1922 that we may be in the position of facing a contested motion. Therefore, legal advice has to be sought, the ground must be cleared and the legislative scaffolding must be in place so that the House can exercise its functions.I welcome the fact that there was very little criticism of the substance of the measure, which is straightforward. The Government will assist the Dáil and Seanad in every way it can as regards the question of culpability, which was raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. If we have to exercise our responsibilities in this area, we will have to do so collectively because a collective decision and judgment of each House will determine the issues involved. In that sense, it is not a Government measure but the Government must heed the legal advice it obtains, act on it and give the benefit of that advice to the Houses.Deputy Costello posed a sequence of questions about the admissibility of evidence in connection with this matter, and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe also touched upon it. As regards the material the Oireachtas may use, view, inspect or act upon, it is a matter for the members of the relevant committee, in the first instance — and guided, as they please, by their legal advisers — to make a determination on this issue. Neither the Houses of the Oireachtas nor their committees are courts of law, and they do not necessarily act on the standards of proof that obtain in courts of law. It is not for me to advise it, but clearly if a committee is established, it can take advice on the matter and decide what is the appropriate course of action relating to any material it may wish to see or act upon, or whether it is constrained as regards such material. That is a matter for the committee. It is not a matter for the Government to tell the committee what to do about the admissibility of evidence because the Houses have a collective responsibility under the Constitution and statute law. The committee will also have a collective responsibility.An important issue relating to the whole subject was touched upon by Deputy Finian McGrath who said the mandate and rights of Independent Deputies should be respected in the composition of any committee. However, we are not sitting on this committee as members of parties, although we would all like to see a fair balance of representation from all the parties. We are sitting, first and foremost, on a serious public issue that requires a collective approach from the Houses.To revert to the question of admissibility, that is as far as I can clarify matters for Deputy Costello. The rules relating to the admissibility of evidence before the courts relate primarily to sworn proceedings which are conducted under oath. Many of the stricter rules relating to admissibility were devised in the context of trials of offenders. The House is not trying an offence in this matter. I can say no more on the subject of admissibility.Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and Deputy Costello raised the question of grooming and whether we could have included other provisions in the legislation. Given the expedition required in this matter, it would have been undesirable to introduce other provisions into this measure, however worthy they may be. The measure before the House is straightforward. Apart from the recitals and citations, the substance of the Bill is in one section. To enter into other matters would complicate the issues. The question of grooming is being examined in the context of preparing a trafficking and child exploitation Bill. Much thought is being given to the question of how grooming can be tackled.I wish to correct Deputy Costello on one matter. The 1998 Act does deal with the question of child pornography on the Internet. The legislation that is being prepared on trafficking and child exploitation may also tackle the issue of grooming.Deputy Finian McGrath suggested the Government was making it up as it went along. That is an unfair comment because the Government has a clear and obvious strategy in regard to the matters which have been the subject of correspondence with the Circuit Court judge. The House must heed the Attorney General's views on a matter like this. There are arguments that the constitutional position of the Houses both in respect of their powers and privileges means we do not necessarily need this legislation. However, the Attorney General has advised us as a matter of prudence that we should so provide. We are best to be guided by him on that issue. The whole question of advisers and persons must be dealt with expressly in the legislation, as Deputy Jim O'Keeffe pointed out.Deputy Cuffe expressed concern about whether Members could view such material on the assumption that the Houses' committees have the power to view the material, as appropriate. He stated that he did not think Oireachtas Members were the best qualified for this job. However, the people elect us to do a job and have provided in their Constitution that we are the people who must make these particular decisions. We cannot shut things out of our minds. We must make judgments and that is the position we have been put in by the people. We cannot shirk our responsibilities by stating that we would like an expert to tell us what we should think about something. At the end of the day, we must decide what is right in this particular matter, which is the responsibility imposed on us.Deputy Cuffe was anxious for expert assistance. If a committee is established, expert assistance is a matter which the committee can consider. He rightly stated that there is a need for solid expert advice which is something a committee of the Houses collectively can make a determination on if matters proceed by way of motion and investigation. We are not yet at that stage but it can all happen. It is very much for the committee to decide these matters. I think I have dealt with most of the points raised directly on the legislation.I appreciate the co-operative spirit with which Members addressed the issues, some of which are very difficult — there is no point pretending that is not the case. Deputy Costello was anxious to be reassured that there was a proper justification for this measure, which is the advice of the Attorney General to the Government that it would be prudent to adopt the measure. At face value it is an unexceptional measure. It is an insertion into the section of the 1998 Act which provides for exemption from the legislation. Clearly, the parliamentary draftspersons of the 1998 Act did not consider the position of the Oireachtas embarking on an inquiry under Article 34 or under the courts of justice legislation. The measure is drafted in such a way that it can only be used for the purposes of, or in connection with, the performance of any function conferred by the Constitution or by law on those Houses, or conferred by a resolution of either of those Houses or resolutions of both of them on such a committee.For example, to take Deputy Cuffe's point about child pornography and the obvious distaste he has for viewing such material, which I can readily understand, the position is that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in carrying out a general inquiry on the subject of child pornography under this legislation, would be allowed to view this material. They might prefer to act on expert advice in a matter of that kind but the position of Parliament is carefully protected by the section which we are proposing to insert into the 1998 Act. It is important that, before we go any further in regard to the matter which has been the subject of correspondence between the Government and the relevant judge, we make sure our position is clear cut as far as legislation is concerned.Wider questions were raised about the appointment and removal of judges. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and I produced a report on this subject called the Fourth Progress Report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution. The Government brought forward proposals on that measure but Deputy O'Keeffe and I ceased to be principals when the proposals arrived on the floor of the House and wiser, or perhaps unwise, persons decided there was no all-party agreement on the matter.

It is not a subject which would have lent itself to a public debate in the nation because the Government was anxious to foster the respect which we want to have for the Judiciary. The Government decided not to have a referendum on the subject at the time and not to proceed with its proposals in the absence of all-party agreement.It reminds us of how important it is in this very sensitive area into which we are entering to try to secure all-party agreement as far as we can. In that context, I appreciate the constructive spirit in which the Opposition parties addressed the issues this afternoon. No Deputy can be content with legislation which is produced in the morning and passed in the late afternoon.

As usual, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has confidently and capably dealt with the points raised here. However, a number of issues are still outstanding.Should the advice, which was made available to the Government, be also made available to Members of the Oireachtas? To a degree we are in the dark because the advice was made available to the Government in respect of this Bill and the other one this morning. Without having had the benefit of that advice, particularly in the short time available, the Opposition is not in a position to come to a reasoned conclusion as to whether the correct approach is being followed or not. We are flying blind to a degree. The same issue will arise in respect of the other procedures on which the Government will embark next week. I suggest it would be a useful initiative for the Government to make available such advice to Opposition spokespersons.The approach to this issue can only be described as "ad hockery". The views presented to us have changed by the day and there are reasonable grounds for suggesting that an ad hoc approach is being followed. That concerns me less than the fact that if all these changes have taken place in the past seven days, what will happen in the next seven days? Have all the angles been covered? Are we clear if the function we are embarked on is to ensure that confidence is maintained in the Judiciary while on the other hand we have fair procedures for a member of the Judiciary whom it is proposed to deal with under Article 35? We need that reflective approach. One of my major concerns is just that, which feeds into the Bills with which we are dealing today as well as the major issues underlying those Bills, namely, the admissibility of possibly constitutionally tainted evidence, questions of compellability generally and the question of self-incrimination.I also refer to the Minister of State's response in respect of grooming and I am glad to note he recognises the problem I raised is a genuine one. Children are not adequately protected from predatory Internet users under our existing law. We may state that dealing with Judge Curtin or any other member of the Judiciary is a matter of urgency. However, it is far more urgent to deal with a situation in which the children of the nation are not adequately protected from paedophiles.I do not understand the Minister's reasoning. There is urgency in getting through a Bill today which deals with a member of the Judiciary, yet there is no urgency when it comes to children who are vulnerable under the existing law. I reject that reasoning and I suggest that some urgency could be injected into the Government's approach to the problems I have highlighted.On the specifics of the Bill, I am unable to table amendments in the short time available. Nothing occurs to me immediately though on Second Stage I asked if all advisers and so on will be covered under the legislation. I accept that the reference to "or any person" probably covers any person associated with the Houses or the committee who might have to deal with the material covered by the Bill. I hope we can establish some procedure through which we will not have to force everyone to look at such images, though that raises another, broader issue. If both Houses are to be involved in the Article 35 process, is there an obligation on all Members who are voting to see and hear all the evidence? That is another issue which has not been dealt with in detail so far. There may be a legal basis for suggesting that someone voting on such a motion might have to see all the evidence, on the basis of natural justice, before fairly and properly casting a vote. That is yet another issue that has not been teased out adequately due to the unseemly haste in dealing with this matter.On that haste, I have no notion of holding up proceedings but I go back to the point I made this morning: we would be better off carrying this process out well rather than quickly. There is an internal conflict in a rushed situation, as almost inevitably one does not do the job well. That is a continuing concern of mine.We are dealing with two Bills today, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) (Amendment) Bill 2004 and the Child Trafficking and Pornography (Amendment) Bill 2004 [Seanad]. Which Bill will go through first? They are both being run simultaneously through the Dáil and Seanad. The compellability legislation is going through the Seanad and may have passed at this point. There are strict time limits involved but a minor point arises. Section 13, as drafted, provides that nothing will prevent the giving of or compliance with the direction under section 3 of the 1997 compellability legislation. There is no reference to the other amending Bill, the legislation under which such a direction will be given if we are dealing with a judge. If the other Bill goes through first and we then pass this Bill, we are making no provision for the issuing of a direction under the other Bill, therefore an exemption provided for under this Bill would be defective. I accept this may be legalistic but let us get our procedures right. I raise the issue to make a constructive point. Basically, we will not be issuing a directive under the 1997 Act; we will be issuing directives under the 2004 Act.

Section 13(a) refers exclusively to the original, parent legislation, the 1997 Act, with no reference to the amending Bill we passed a couple of hours ago, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) (Amendment) Bill 2004. This flaw may be similar to that corrected by the Labour Party last night in Article 35.4. That Article refers directly to the Supreme and High Courts. The enabling legislation for the Circuit Court, the 1924 Act, was omitted, which would have been a fatal flaw in the legislation if it had gone through in that form. That may well be the case here and the Minister should probably accept an amendment to deal with it. Deputy O’Keeffe probably thought of that on his feet but there was not enough time to peruse the legislation adequately.Section 13(b) contains a list of exemptions for members of the committee in the possession, publication, distribution, printing or showing of material. How comprehensive is that list? What about the process of obtaining material on one hand or viewing material on the other hand? What about disposal or retention of the material? The wrong word, “showing”, is used here. If we could have the Minister of State’s attention it would be useful.

"Viewing" would be the appropriate word in the case but it is omitted from the list applying to any Member or official carrying out their duties and functions for the committee. The question of whether the full wording is adequate needs to be addressed. It comes back to the old point, if we had the time we could have teased out all these issues and the Minister of State could have presented more concise legislation.I referred earlier to the question of inadmissibility. There is a presumption in the Bill that the members of a committee will view material which is pornographic, will have it in their possession or will distribute it. From that point of view it would be preferable, prior to enacting the Bill, if Members had the advice of the Attorney General on all these matters because these matters apply on a specific as well as on a general base. This legislation refers to general as well as specific matters. They are not prompted totally in a vacuum. It would certainly have been important to all of us to have had the legal advice that the Attorney General has had for the Government or has engaged through senior counsel to advise him.It was good to hear the Minister of State say that Europe and other countries see our Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 as the model law in child protection. Even a model law, however, can have its loopholes. There are areas that are not up to date and perhaps this is the impetus to ensure that legislation is reviewed and adapted to deal with new areas, such as the ruling to which he referred, and that whatever amendment is required will be put in place. There is no greater crime than the abuse of vulnerable children. Given that the matter has been brought to our attention, the legislation should be reviewed and amended, if necessary.

Like any lawyer who is advising his client, there are other parties involved here who have lawyers and clients as well. I presume that is part of the thinking. I give an undertaking to the two Deputies to see what consultations can be arranged to ensure they are briefed on these matters, because they are serious matters.On the point raised by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe about the section and section 3 of the 1997 Act, and that the parallel measure today amends the 1997 Act, I have looked at that question in some detail and taken legal advice on it. The position is that the direction is made under section 3 of the 1997 Act. The legislation which went through the House this morning does not affect the direction provision in section 3 of the 1997 Act, hence the reference is correct as stated in the new section 1.13(a). In other words, the direction is made under section 3 of the 1997 Act. That is what the measure refers to. No direction is being made under the 2004 amending Bill which passed through this House this morning. If one examines the 2004 Bill, it is clear it does not deal with a direction under section 3, hence the statutory reference is correct. I am glad the Deputy raised the issue because it has given us an opportunity to tease it out.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I was genuinely worried about the issue. The Bills are parallel at present but which of them goes through first? In the earlier Bill, we inserted a new section after section 3 to deal with the position in regard to compellability. I see some substance in the point raised by the Minister that one is still issuing the direction under section 3. However, the Bill before the House refers to a direction issued under section 3 of the 1997 Act but effectively it will be under the 1997 Act, as amended.I wonder whether there is a legal point here that one would be tied into a position where it would apply only to a direction issued under the earlier legislation. Should something be done to clarify which of the Bills goes through first and, if so, is there need for a reference to the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997, as amended. I cannot bring it any further but in the short time available to me it is a point that occurs to me. It could take a day or two in the Supreme Court to resolve this but I would prefer to see it resolved here.

Section 1.3A is an entirely new section inserted by the 2004 Bill and does not refer to the direction. The direction is in section 3 of the 1997 Act. The power which the Oireachtas committee has is dealt with in that section, hence, the reason this is used in cross-reference in the Child Trafficking and Pornography (Amendment) Bill.

The Bill before the House simply refers to section 3 of the 1997 Act, but it should contemplate the amendments introduced at an earlier stage to have the fullness of authority. If we are going on the principle that neither item of legislation is strictly necessary, compellability may not be necessary as an individual may turn up voluntarily, and in the other case no material may be presented to the committee. Nevertheless, it is a belt and braces effort to ensure precautionary steps are taken. It seems appropriate at this stage to include the reference to the new legislation which has extended the remit of the 1997 legislation.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I accept the direction is issued under section 3. If it is issued under section 3 of the 1997 Act before it is amended, apparently the direction cannot be issued to a judge. We are talking about the question of proceedings or a matter arising in regard to judges under Article 35 of the Constitution. Therefore, if a direction is being issued it has to take into account the fact that it is capable of being issued under the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act 1997, as amended, by the compellability legislation before the House. Will that end up as a separate section? This morning the 1997 Act was amended by inserting a section after section 3 which was referred to as section 3A. I wish to draw attention to an apparent defect in the legislation as it is currently before us.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	191	We have checked the matter with the Parliamentary Counsel who drafted the measure and he is satisfied this is the correct drafting approach. It is a question of drafting. Let me reiterate the position. The power to issue directions are vested in these committees under section 3(1) of the 1997 Act. The measure which came before the House this morning did not affect that power in any way because the expressed power derives from the 1997 Act.

That subsection has effectively been restricted in the circumstances envisaged in the 2004 Bill, but that does not affect the power. No additional power has been conferred by the Bill this morning.

That is the fundamental point. The 2004 Bill does not confer such power as the actual direction is made pursuant to section 3(1) of the 1997 Act. In referring to the 1997 Act, we are right in stating that the direction stems from that legislation. That is as far as I can assist the House on that point.

It is a valid point. I hope the Minister is correct but this is an example of what can arise when legislation is rushed, as there is not adequate opportunity to tease it out.

Viewing was not part of the 1998 Act and it would not have been appropriate to introduce it here. The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 does not include viewing as a concept, hence we could not introduce it in this Bill when it was not in the original parent statute.

Deputy Costello suggested also that the Bill contains a presumption about a specific matter or about admissibility. I have to disagree with him on that point. It does not. That is a matter for the committee. This legislation is abstract in character. It contains no presumption about how the committee will decide that issue. If the committee were to so decide, it protects the position of the members of the committee and of the Houses subsequently.

We have a responsibility and a duty to ensure we set a standard and, at the very least, that we achieve the target set by the UN of 0.7% of GDP in terms of development aid. We are not meeting that target or setting an example, which is a pity especially this year when we had the opportunity with the EU Presidency to set that example. Other countries in the EU have met and exceeded that target. We need to do so but, at the very least, we should achieve the target set by Dóchas and Development Co-operation Ireland. We call on the Government to end its totally unjustifiable three year freeze on overseas development aid spending levels and to immediately start to implement targets which have been agreed and which it stated it would achieve by 2007. We need a renewed commitment to achieve that target.We live in a world in which 50 countries are poorer now than they were in 1990. That is an indictment of the western world in particular. We live in a world in which an elite few have more money than they can possibly spend in a lifetime, yet one in five people survive rather than live on less than €1 a day. In 20 countries, more than one person in four goes hungry, that is, one quarter of the population. In 700 other countries, one quarter of children do not live beyond the age of five. In nine countries in this small world, one person in four still does not have access to safe water.It would cost $100 billion to cut global poverty by half by 2015, the same amount spent by the United States on its war in Iraq. The war in Iraq is not over and the United States will continue to spend and waste more money instead of targeting global poverty. In 2002, indebted countries made a net transfer of twice that amount in payments to the wealthy nations. At present states spend only half the needed amount on development aid, preferring to lavish $800 billion a year building and deploying their armies. That is a scandalous figure. In the modern western world, building and deploying armies around the world is more important than tackling poverty. Four years into the new millennium, military spending continues to dwarf spending on development aid at a global level and in the EU. Even in this State, whose Government prides itself on being a leading donor country, our military spending is increasing.With the so-called "war on terror" and the plan to build an EU army, starting with a common armaments policy, we are pushing ever further in that warped direction. We believe that the international community must get its priorities right. Up to now, it has got them dead wrong. What must guide international relations policy in the future united Ireland is the objective of achieving human security. That human security concept recognises that the most deadly weapons of mass destruction are hunger, poverty, disease, death, inequality, dependence, dominance, exploitation, dictatorship, state clientelism, torture, abuse and other systematic sources of suffering. Those are the real threats and sources of insecurity for the vast majority on the planet.That is why we assert that the fulfilment of the UN millennium development goals, which aim to cut global poverty by half by 2015, should be elevated to a top international spending and policy priority. Their achievement will contribute more to global security than the so-called "war on terror" that is cannibalising budgets and resources internationally. We have long known the steps required. Now we have the millennium development goals, a set of eight concrete steps, shared goals and matching targets which we believe chart out our future progress and commitment. We must reach and exceed those goals.I urge that, in the short time left of Ireland's EU Presidency, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for overseas development and human rights, Deputy Kitt, should report to this House and debate this State's implementation of the Barcelona commitments and the Government's plan to play its part in achieving the millennium development goals. Government time must also periodically be made available to allow Ministers to report to the full House on what is being done in the name of the Irish people at other international fora and financial institutions such as the World Trade Organisation. I ask the Minister to respond to that and I hope that we will have more regular debates on whether we are achieving those goals.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh as a chuid ama a roinnt liom. Tá sé an-suimiúil go bhfuil an Bille um Chomhlachas Forbartha Idirnáisiúnta (Leasú) 2003 ag féachaint ar mhéid mór airgid, ach deir sé sa chur síos a d'eisigh an Roinn Airgeadais: "IDA is the "soft" loan arm of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (The World Bank)." It is important that people know the context in which this development has taken place and that, when I meet ambassadors as party leader, very often on their agenda is the wish that Ireland make it clear that it will reach the 0.7% of GNP target for overseas development aid, as it committed itself to do at the United Nations. They are not convinced, by the manner in which the Government is acting, that it will be reached. The Government must take steps to ensure that it happens and that the slippage stops.Given that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is here, it is also important to recognise that farmers in the poorest countries very often have questions similar to those of farmers in our country about the system that keeps them in poverty. Constituents of mine who are at the pin of their collar trying to make a living from farming often ask me why imports that come from half way around the world are sold far more cheaply in local shops in north County Dublin and elsewhere than their food and produce, which they grow down the road. The same question is asked by farmers in poorer countries who may be living on €1 or €2 a day. Of course, they are in even more serious trouble.It is important to bear in mind that there is a system of corporate-led development which must be analysed. The World Bank is part of it, as is the millennium round mentioned in the briefing from the Department of Finance. It stems from the fact that the global industrial food system arose in the context of the corporate-led global economy, employing taxpayers' money, a truth not often realised. At the behest of big business, Governments have funded many types of infrastructure that are not there to benefit the local economy, for example, motorways or even high-speed rail links on the Continent, tunnels, bridges and communications satellites. All those make it possible to sell food from the other side of the world at a lower price than local produce.On top of that, taxpayers are subsidising aviation fuel and energy production, on which long-distance trade depends. Even the Kyoto protocol does not take into account international trade as a source of emissions. The continual expansion of that infrastructure and the resultant increased global trade leads to the breakdown of local and regional economies. That is behind much of the reason there is the poverty to which we are trying to commit €50 million, which is a drop in the ocean compared with overall needs but a great deal of money if one is in a local economy in Ireland.Since the 1940s, international trade has dominated a growing number of national economies. In that period, world trade grew twelvefold. Imports and exports now make up a much larger proportion of economic activity than ever before. With international trade amounting to $5.5 trillion annually, that explosive increase in global trade has fed the growth of the trading bodies, that is, the transnational corporations, many of which have more economic clout than entire nations. A comparison of national GDPs with the annual revenues of transnational corporations shows that half of the hundred largest economies in the world are now such corporations.The outline of today's globalised economy was established at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, where western leaders met to design a new financial architecture for the post-war period to keep the growth economy alive and prevent another depression. That was to be accomplished by drawing more of the world's economies into the orbit of the consumer economy, thereby dramatically expanding the market for industrial goods while assuring unfettered access to the planet's natural resources. With that in mind, three supranational institutions were established, the first being the World Bank, which we are discussing today. The second was the International Monetary Fund and the third was the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, known as GATT.In the Bretton Woods scheme, the World Bank would provide funding for major development projects, including huge centralised energy plants, long-distance transport networks and high-speed communications systems, thereby creating the physical infrastructure required by huge trading corporations. There is nothing wrong with those projects per se, but they were not built first and foremost to bolster local economies. They have been instrumental in undermining such economies, including our own, which we are now told is the most globalised in the world.The IMF would work to impose a standardised economic architecture, with western-style consumer growth as the foundation, on every national economy. Strict structural adjustment policies would be imposed on borrowing countries that did not adhere to that plan. GATT, meanwhile, would serve to increase every nation's dependence on long-distance trade by keeping tariffs low, removing other perceived barriers to trade and turning ever more realms of life into globally tradable commodities. Further south — in the main, the poorer countries — that framework ushered in the era of what is often called "development", with goals and policies that followed seamlessly from the colonial era that preceded it.Though ostensibly more noble in its aims, the results of that framework were strikingly similar. A northern economic model based on industrial production, trade and economic growth was to be systematically imposed throughout what was known — and still is, in many cases — as the Third World. As in the colonial period, a large portion of the south's production and resources would continue to flow northwards. In 1994 member nations of GATT created a new and powerful governing body known as the World Trade Organisation to set trade rules and settle disputes.Countries which joined the WTO implicitly agreed to reorganise their national economies in ways that are more conducive to foreign trade and investment. This reorganisation includes the privatisation of industry and the dismantling of any social programme or labour, environmental or health regulation that could be interpreted as a non-tariff barrier to trade. We see that in this country when we try to promote reuse and recycling, for example. If it is against competition it cannot be done; we cannot reduce the waste. There are many knock-on effects. Of course, at Seattle in 1999 trade ministers were meeting to negotiate rules for a new millennium round, as it was called, which would further eliminate hindrances to the speculative flow of capital and trade around the globe and place greater limitations on any government's ability to protect its citizens and the environment.It is not just in the case of the food economy and meeting people's basic needs but overall that there is a particular drive afoot which will not be arrested, regardless of how many millions we put into the International Development Association, even if it is a zero interest arrangement. The pressure from the WTO to further dismantle whatever possibilities exist to develop local economies is extremely strong. From the viewpoint of conscience, whatever about policy or political choices, how is it that this country can stand over a system that impoverishes the poorest in the world and then blithely pretend we are doing fine and that we will help them as best we can? We have to realise that Irish farmers are suffering in the same way as their counterparts in the Third World because they are being forced to participate in a system which depends on long-distance transportation. Ultimately they are being made increasingly vulnerable. We should reflect on that rather than just count how much money we can afford to give this year or the next.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill. The figure of €50 million is the cornerstone of the Bill. While I welcome the fact that €50 million is being given to the developing world, as we all do, it needs to be seen in the context of where we are at, particularly in this country. Some 1.2 billion people in the world live on less than $1 a day. These 1.2 billion people must eke out an existence on less than the price of a newspaper. They are living, or dying, on less money than is provided to the average unit of livestock in the European Union. Those figures and facts speak for themselves. We live in a country that has grown rapidly in the last ten to 15 years. Major changes have taken place in our lifestyle. Major changes have taken place right across Europe and in every aspect of the world in which we live.When we consider that number of people starving across the world one wonders what we have been about. I question the fact that Europe and America cannot agree on a planned and structured way to help developing countries. We can talk about war and trouble in the world, but we must tackle the problem of providing the basic food people need in their daily lives. I cannot understand why superpowers such as America and an expanding European economy cannot combine to put in place a plan that would help those people. Most people in this House will recall collecting pennies in a box each week for the people of the Third World. It was known as "the penny for the black babies". At that stage, when we were a poor country we sent small amounts of money as children to those people in the poorer world. I believe Ireland has a lead role to play when it comes to talks at EU level. The current EU Presidency gives us an opportunity to show leadership in this field. We have led in the past. Irish priests, nuns and lay missionaries have gone into various parts of the world and made their mark, in a poorer generation, one that came through hard times.There is an onus on this generation of Irish people to show leadership in the ongoing saga of poverty in our world. It is a frightening statistic that 1.2 billion people are living on $1 a day. It is something we must keep in mind every time we debate this issue. While we welcome the €50 million, it is seen in context when compared with the amount of money we recently spent on electronic voting. We are told that €52 million is the figure this country wasted on electronic voting and we are clapping ourselves on the back for giving €50 million to the world's poor. We must show some leadership as a country and as Europeans. We must force the agenda on the world stage and show we mean business as regards the Third World. If we do not, we will undermine our position as Europeans. People hope this country will develop and go from strength to strength yet the problems of the world's poor continue to fester.Deputy Richard Bruton stated on Second Stage that the Government had set itself a development aid target of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. Can this be achieved? We should try to exceed that figure in every possible way as we examine budgets and wastage in our country. We would support that from this side of the House. We as parliamentarians in a country that is doing so well have a responsibility to address this problem and seek to increase the aid we give to those poor countries.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 167 together.The work which has been done by my Department's advisers in co-operation with Aer Rianta management and its advisers has underscored the fact that there are some major challenges facing the State airports. These challenges need to be addressed.In the context of the proposed amending legislation to give effect to the restructuring of Aer Rianta, I have had numerous Government discussions informing my Cabinet colleagues on the background issues as well as outlining the broad financial projections for each of the airports, compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Some issues of both a legal and financial nature remain to be finalised and I will be returning to the Government shortly when these issues are clarified. It remains my intention that the amending legislation can be enacted before the summer recess.The new arrangements are designed to strengthen and expand each of the three airports and to give Shannon and Cork a fresh start. Through more focused commercial operation, all three airports can perform better and each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional and national economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry. I announced the boards-designate for Dublin and Shannon Airports which bring together people of the highest calibre and combine considerable international and national aviation expertise with proven financial and business acumen. I will announce the full membership of the new Cork Airport board-designate shortly.It is general policy that the three State airports should be in a position to provide cost competitive and appropriate infrastructure and to operate on a sustainable commercial basis in meeting the current and prospective needs of users. In the case of Dublin Airport, passenger traffic is forecast to grow to 30 million passengers per annum by around 2020. The Dublin Airport Authority must ensure the provision of adequate and cost-effective infrastructure capacity to cater for this growth and to make the appropriate case to the independent aviation regulator for the financing of this investment in the context of the next determination of airport charges.I have made clear on numerous occasions that with a fresh start both Shannon and Cork Airports will be a commercial success and each will maximise sustainable employment within the airport companies and in their catchment areas. It is envisaged that the new airport authorities for Shannon and Cork will commence business free of legacy debt and this will have a major positive impact on the commercial viability of these two airports. It is proposed that those debts will remain with Dublin Airport which is effectively carrying the debts for the three airports. I have given repeated assurances to the ICTU and the Aer Rianta unions that there will be no diminution in the terms and conditions of employment of workers in the company on transfer to the new airport authorities. I have also made available key financial information on the three airports to the unions' financial advisers in the context of the current engagement process which is being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission.Responsibility for Shannon Development rests with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who is in contact with the board of that agency regarding its role in light of the forthcoming decentralisation of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon, and the advent of the new autonomous Shannon Airport authority. With regard to the dual gateway status at Shannon, my officials, at a meeting earlier this month in Washington with US officials, emphasised the importance of Shannon Airport for the economy of the west of Ireland, in particular in the context of Ireland's national spatial strategy which aims to counterbalance the growth of Dublin by focusing economic activity on a number of other locations. My officials also outlined the Irish Government's decision to separate Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports into autonomous airport authorities to enable them to maximise their potentials. In that context, they indicated that Shannon needs some years in which to transform its business plans and marketing strategies.The eventual effect of an EU-US open-skies deal, should such a deal emerge, would be to leave the choice of airports with the airlines. In the absence of special bilateral arrangements between Ireland and the United States in such a case, there is a risk that the open-skies arrangement could mean a sudden end to the current Shannon stop requirement, which could have immediate negative impacts for Shannon. I met the US Secretary for Transportation, Norman Mineta, at a meeting of European Transport Ministers yesterday and I re-emphasised to him that an acceptable arrangement for Shannon must be reached before I will be in a position to agree to any EU-US aviation agreement that might be put to the Transport Council on 10 and 11 June next.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I thank the Minister for his reply. He said that he has given assurances to the unions and he knows what is going on. Is he aware that over the past week while negotiations continue with Aer Lingus personnel over staff cuts in Shannon, Aer Lingus has removed ground-handling equipment from Shannon Airport? Is it not a disgrace that this is happening while these negotiations continue? Is there a five-year plan for the airport or has the Minister instructed Aer Lingus to submit a plan for it?Is the Minister aware that Aer Lingus management has refused to handle Lufthansa Cargo's equipment although it flies into Shannon once a week, 52 weeks a year, in off-peak hours? Aer Lingus management has told Lufthansa to go to Servisair because it does not want to handle the equipment. What is going on? I believe that the Minister does not know what is happening there. This is the real picture. He said in his reply: "Shannon needs some years in which to transform its business plans and marketing strategies."

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	213	All right, I was just quoting what the Minister said. Is the Minister aware that Heathrow Airport authorities have asked for a derogation until 2015 for the open-skies agreement? How many years has the Minister asked for so that the bilateral agreement can stay in place? These are the important questions. Is it not irresponsible of the Minister to allow this to go on? Has he commissioned an impact study on the effect this would have on Shannon? The PricewaterhouseCoopers report shows that Shannon could lose up to €125 million by 2008. Does he have a management plan or impact study in place? In what direction does he feel the airport will go? What analysis has he done? With regard to the decentralisation of Enterprise Ireland to Shannon is it not a fact that only two staff have applied for transfer to Shannon? Will Enterprise Ireland consume Shannon Development's briefing although it has done good work in the region?

I conveyed my view to the council, which I also conveyed to the board of Aer Lingus, that in the context of the future of Shannon Airport, Aer Lingus must do more and be more specific about precisely what it will do in an open-skies connection. It is a commercial organisation and I have no alternative but to let it make commercial decisions, which I have done consistently since I took this post, but I said that as we move to open skies and Shannon prepares for the future it needs to know clearly and crisply the best Aer Lingus can do in the couple of years from now in terms of numbers of transatlantic flights available, to which destinations and their frequency.In other words Aer Lingus needs to spell out its commitment to Shannon. I will encourage it to do that and I have asked it to let me and my Department know what its plans are as I negotiate the bilateral agreement, which we are negotiating, and as we negotiate the open-skies agreement, which as EU President we are involved in negotiating with the United States. As soon as I have definite information from Aer Lingus I will give it to the Deputy.

In recent weeks we have seen further consultants' reports which confirm earlier reports that there is no business case for proceeding with the break-up of Aer Rianta. Arising out of those findings, will the Minister confirm that if he goes ahead with the break-up of Aer Rianta it will entail a substantial capital reduction to pay the dividend to the Minister for Finance and that will essentially devastate the Aer Rianta company as we know it? Does the Minister intend that if he goes ahead with these proposals it will entail Dublin Airport retaining a significant shareholding in Shannon which cannot survive on its own?Has it been confirmed, and does the Minister accept, that Cork Airport cannot stand alone and that Dublin must remain as the landlord for Cork Airport which will become a subsidiary of Dublin Airport? Does the Minister accept that if he proceeds with his plans they will result in mass redundancies in Shannon Airport, and wage cuts? Does he also accept that if he proceeds with these plans, they will result in significant airport charges at all three airports, especially in Dublin where a 50% increase is forecast?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Government laid down a 12 month timetable for the completion of the process, from July 2003 to July 2004. It is May 2004 and I am still of the view that it can be completed within the 12 month schedule envisaged by the Government.Regarding consultant‘s reports, the PricewaterhouseCoopers assessment is a series of working papers. I did not ask it to give me an assessment of whether restructuring was a good idea; I asked it to lay out on a factual basis the financial information available to it.

When the Government made this decision in July 2003, all the information that is now available was, in substance, available to it. There is nothing new in the reports of any of the consultants employed by the trade unions or in other financial analyses, either from the board, the new boards designate or from consultancy houses.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	228	There is nothing about shedding assets.

There is nothing new in any of it. All the financial information was put before the Government in July 2003 when the decision was taken. It was put before the Government again in October 2003 when the Government took the decision for the second time. The information that appears to be emerging selectively was available to the Government. There was nothing new in the information. The board of a public limited company like Aer Rianta, with its directors coming from different walks of life, including the trade union movement, would have been aware of the full financial position.

The dividend to the Minister for Finance this year was about €7 million out of profits of €20 million. This is a technically difficult area. The Deputy may be referring to the financial mechanism that has been recommended by solicitors to allow the revenue reserves in the plc to be of such a scale as to dividend out Shannon and Cork. For that to happen, internal dividend movements would have to take place. We have engaged Matheson Ormsby Prentice, who for four months——

Since the beginning of this process I have been determined that, in future, the people of the Cork and Shannon regions will have the facility of autonomous airports. My faith in the people of those areas to develop those airports remains stronger than ever. I visited both facilities and met people there on several occasions.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I set out my policy proposals for public transport reform in statements to the public transport partnership forum in November 2002 and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport in June 2003.The principal elements of my proposals are the establishment of an independent procurement and regulatory authority for transport on a national basis, and the introduction of controlled competition in the bus market in the Dublin area in the form of franchising as the primary means of procuring bus services. I have no plans to privatise Dublin Bus.As I stated on a number of occasions before the House, I am firmly of the view that franchising is the most effective means of achieving genuine market opening in the Dublin market. I have formed this view on the basis of international experience and major independent studies carried out by bodies, including the European Commission and the public transport partnership forum, which have shown franchising to be the most efficient and effective way of procuring urban bus services. Franchising will allow for genuine market opening, with operators other than the existing State-owned companies having a role to play in the delivery of services.Where markets are opened to competition, it is an important principle of European Union law that undertakings throughout the Union should be free to compete for the award of contracts. I have no plans to depart from that principle, which has been to Ireland's great benefit throughout the economy.While recent public discussion on public transport reform has focused almost exclusively on organisational issues and public monopoly provider concerns, the focus of my reforms is primarily on delivering a better service to the customer and greater value for money to the taxpayer.With regard to the issue of safety, all bus operators, both private and public, are subject to the same body of safety legislation and this position will continue in the reformed market. It remains my intention to proceed with legislation on public transport reform in 2004.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	248	It is interesting to note that a number of today's questions are on public service companies. We already discussed the situation in Aer Rianta and there is also a problem with CIE. Difficulties are also apparent in public transport in Dublin, especially in regard to Dublin Bus.I accept that opening up the public transport market will give people choice, but people are concerned that if new companies come into the market, they will be operating on the same routes as Dublin Bus. How will that improve transport for people in these areas?Another concern is that many private buses are not wheelchair accessible. We have seen the debacle with regard to taxi deregulation where we had an opportunity to ensure taxis would be more accessible to people with disabilities and so on. Will new operators coming in to the bus market have to be accessible to people who are wheelchair-bound or have other disabilities?Significant investment has been made in public transport. People do not understand why the services that have been built up by those companies are being opened up to private operators. It is not even the case that new routes are being opened up, the Minister intends tendering existing routes. Does he have proposals to open up new routes? We have heard of possible cutbacks in Dublin Bus routes rather than new services being on offer.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The bus market in the Dublin area is growing dramatically. I hope to at least double the number of quality bus corridors in the next year or so. This will attract more people to public transport. The passenger numbers are already impressive on existing bus corridors as people realise buses are a more reliable way to travel. The 1932 Act is very restrictive and needs to be updated, which is what we are doing. New routes will be added throughout the city and county, not just in the core areas.I have never seen my proposals as taking bus routes from somebody who owns them. Bus routes belong to the people. The service is provided to the consumer. No company, as such, owns the bus routes. It is a duty and privilege to serve the public on these routes. They do not belong to a particular corporate structure but to the people.I am trying to open up the market to offer more choice to the public and give people a better and more transparent service. That does not imply any criticism of Dublin Bus which I have said on many occasions is a very good company.The Deputy is correct in regard to buses being wheelchair accessible. Dublin Bus has received significant investment from the taxpayer to bring the fleet up to wheelchair accessible standards and the majority of buses are now in that category. The company is moving fast to complete the upgrading of the fleet so that all buses will be wheelchair accessible.It is my intention that any private sector companies, be they international, national or local operators, will be required to meet the same high standards as their counterparts in the public sector. I would not tolerate a situation where the standards of a private company would not match existing high standards regarding wheelchair accessibility or any other consideration. I expect them to operate to the same standards and for there to be a genuinely level playing field in this area.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The programme for Government contains a commitment to develop a metro with a link to Dublin Airport. I have received the revised outline business case for line one of the metro from the Railway Procurement Agency, which involves a line from the airport to the city centre. The estimated direct cost of physical construction in 2002 prices is €1.2 billion. This excludes financial costs.The timescale, precise cost and route, number and location of stations and arrangements for a connection to the green Luas line will depend on a number of factors including: the Government's decision; geo-technical surveys; negotiations with bidders; and railway order processes, including the public inquiry. In preparing a submission for the Government on this matter, the merits of all alternative solutions and routes will be considered.I am currently finalising my proposals on the metro in the context of the wider transport needs of the greater Dublin area. In advance of the Government considering these proposals, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matters raised in any great detail. However, I expect to bring my proposals to the Government before the summer.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	251	With respect, the Minister is like a broken record. He has been saying for the past 12 months that the metro proposals will be going before Government shortly. However, nothing appears to have been finalised in respect of this matter. Will he provide a revised estimate on when he expects the metro to be completed in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. Would 2010 be a more accurate date for its completion?The Minister stated that the projected cost of the metro is €1.2 billion. Does he have any realistic idea of what will be the actual cost? Is he going to bring forward proposals to Government to address the serious cost creep that is affecting infrastructural projects in this country? This matter has been highlighted by the ESRI in the mid-term review of the NDP. There does not appear to be competence within the Government to address the cost creep that has been taking place in construction and infrastructural projects throughout the country. Will the critical infrastructure Bill be published before the metro goes to tender?

The costs stand at €1.2 billion but this figure excludes financial costs and only relates to the direct cost of physical construction. I would, therefore, expect the final cost to be substantially more than €1.2 billion. The RPA focused on the physical construction costs because, in terms of obtaining bids and sorting tenders, it needed an indicative figure.The critical infrastructure Bill is being brought forward by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I have been involved in a number of discussions with him about the legislation. It is my intention, however, to introduce a separate critical infrastructure (metro) Bill to deal with metro related issues. The start-up of any metro would not necessarily have to await the introduction of such legislation and could happen in parallel.

Professor Melis and many other experts considered this issue and that of the serious cost creep that has taken place in respect of the Luas project. On foot of their findings, does the Minister not agree that it is critically important to have such legislation in place prior to the commencement of work on the metro?What discussions have taken place with the Department of Finance regarding the establishment of an independent infrastructural review unit? Does the Minister agree it is not acceptable that the Department which is in charge of putting forward the proposals for the metro is also responsible for project management and the final outturn and that it does not seem logical that one arm of the State is supposed to police itself? Does he also agree this is part of the reason for the significant cost creep in infrastructural projects?The Minister will need to be more specific with regard to figures if he is bringing them to Cabinet. I understand — perhaps the Minister will clarify the position — that in providing the figures, the RPA was quite specific as regards the number of stations that should be included.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The advisers engaged by the RPA have estimated that the cost of the various options for phase 1 of the project is €1.2 billion in terms of total direct construction costs at 2002 prices. These figures increase substantially when one estimates a final cost which takes account of expected inflation during the period between now and the date on which services commence, VAT, fees, interest charges, the cost of risk transfer and a provision for risk and contingency. A more accurate cost can only be determined when the final structure of the project is decided and, more importantly, when competitive bids are received from the interested parties. I would seek to move on that as a matter of urgency.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 18 together.General responsibility for energy policy is a matter for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In August 2003 the National Roads Authority published updated road traffic forecasts for the period 2002-40. The forecasts were based on: a review of the growth factors published in the national roads needs study 1998; estimates of vehicle kilometres travelled in the year 2001, derived from a programme of manual and automatic traffic counts covering local and national roads; population and vehicle fleet forecasts; and forecasts of gross national product. Overall, the forecasts project an increase of 67% in car and light goods vehicle traffic and 86% in HGV traffic over the period 2002-40. These compare to projected increases of 124% in car and light goods vehicle traffic and 88% in HGV traffic in the national road needs study in 1998 for the period 1995-2020. The lower projected growth in car traffic in the road forecasts reflects the major growth that has occurred in the period 1995 to 2001.The impact of oil price increases was not specifically taken into account in the methodology used in the NRNS or in the more recent forecasts. It is generally recognised that the demand for transport is highly price inelastic and that increases in the cost of fuel will not lead to proportionate reductions in travel demand or road traffic volume. Trends in actual and projected traffic will be kept under review. Sustained changes in traffic volumes and patterns arising for whatever reason, including the impact of a sustained high level of increase in oil prices, will be taken into account in transport planning generally and the planning and design of road projects.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	258	Will the Minister confirm that the key point in his reply is that we have taken no account of the possible projected price of oil in 2040 and that we have no view in that regard in terms of managing future traffic demand? While he states that the demand for transport is highly price inelastic, does he not agree that the real issue is that most people do not have a choice? It is inelastic, first, because corrupt planning procedures have led to the building of housing estates without the provision of other facilities around our cities and, second, because the Department and the Government have refused to invest in public transport. Does the Minister agree that most of the inelasticity is not because people want to drive their cars everywhere but results from the fact that they simply do not have a choice in that regard?Does the Minister also agree that the one area where choice possibly exists is that of long, interurban journeys because it is possible to choose to take the train from Dublin to Cork, Galway, Waterford or Limerick? Does he further agree this is the one area where we could take into account increasing oil prices and possibly decide to invest in intercity rail links rather than in the motorways on which he is spending the entire transport budget?

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I do not know what oil prices will be at the end of this year, not to mind in 2040. While I know where the Deputy is coming from on this, if we concern ourselves with future oil prices, there will be little else of concern to us.We have had much discussion on investment in public transport. Between 2004 and 2008 the sum available for investment is €3.5 billion. One billion of that is an operational subsidy investment in the CIE group while the rest is capital investment. The Deputy is aware of the substantial investment now in public transport. A few days ago we announced the opening of the Midleton line. The completion of continuous welded track of the inter-urban lines has brought us to a situation where almost the entire track in the country is new. A substantial amount of new rolling stock and carriages are on order and being delivered on a daily basis. The upgrade of the DART is an enormous investment which is going ahead, particularly at weekends. The Luas is also coming to fruition. An enormous amount of taxpayers money is going into public transport right across the system, in buses, trains and quality bus corridors.I make no apologies for linking the main urban centres of the State by motorway, although the Deputy and I will never be in agreement on that. This is what the taxpayer and the public would want along with first class rail services between those areas.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The Minister is spending four times more on new roads than he is on public transport in our capital budget. While I agree with the Minister that I do not know what the price of oil will be in 2040, does he not agree it would be appropriate for the Department of Transport to include some analysis of fuel projections given the billions being spent every year on future transport patterns? Does he agree that such an analysis, if it showed a massive increase in the price of oil, might lead him to change his investment patterns from the pattern where we invest four times more on inter-urban motorways to one where we would invest more on urban and inter-urban rail systems that might be cheaper to run in 2020 or 2040, based on oil price predictions? I agree I do not know what the price will be but I would have a good bet that it will be a multiple of what it is now. For the Minister to disregard that fact completely in his planning seems reckless.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	265	My point is that no matter what country we are talking about, Ministers take a cautious stab at what oil prices might be in the next 12 months. They do not care to go beyond that because that would involve total conjecture. I understand the Deputy's point that if oil continues to rise in price over the long term, we might be better off investing more in trains and less in cars. I understand the Deputy's political view on these matters and respect it.I have not decided to build roads instead of railways but to build both. I must get on and do that. We hope to have more high speed inter-city trains and more commuter trains such as the Midleton one over the next few months and more investment in modern rolling stock. I look forward to us continuing to develop our rail and bus systems and to investing more in them. The reason the spend on roads is so high is that the spending is peaking now. We did not have a good road network and have had to catch up. We must get to a certain stage.It is not a competition between road and rail. We must have modern motorways and high-speed inter-city trains between our major urban areas. This country can achieve both if we approach the issue in a determined manner. That is what we are doing. It is not an either-or situation. We need both. If people want to go to Cork or Galway, they must be able to get on a good value high-speed comfortable train, and if they want to drive, they must be able to drive on a motorway. I do not accept it should be an either-or situation. We must press on with both as urgently as we can.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 40 together.I was delighted to announce, on my visit to Cork last week, that the Government has approved the development of a commuter rail service between Mallow and Midleton to meet the long-term needs of the east Cork region.The development involves the construction of new rail stations on the existing main rail line between Mallow and Kent Station and the re-laying of track and reopening of services between Cork city and Midleton. In all, five new stations will be constructed at Blarney, Kilbarry, Dunkettle, Carrigtwohill and Midleton. The proposals emanate from the Cork area strategic plan, CASP, which was commissioned by Cork City and County Councils in 2000.The new rail commuter service is designed to meet the long-term needs of the rapidly expanding east Cork region, to alleviate traffic congestion into and out of the city at peak times and to attract industrial and commercial developers.The CASP and the strategic rail review, commissioned by my Department, both supported the case for upgrading commuter rail services in the Cork area. A feasibility study conducted by Iarnród Éireann showed a positive economic return for the proposed rail developments.Iarnród Éireann has already begun design work on the project and is concluding technical examinations of the new stretch of line between Glounthaune and Midleton. When the examinations are completed, I expect to receive from the company detailed costings for the infrastructure and rolling stock requirements. The funds will be provided from my Department's capital investment envelope, from the special contributions schemes established by the local authorities and from private developers' contributions. It is also hoped to secure EU funding for the project.The approach taken by the authorities in Cork, through the CASP, is a model plan for the integration of land use and transportation strategies, and one which other local and regional authorities around the country would be advised to follow.The CASP contains proposals for further expansion of commuter rail services, in the longer term, including extending the Midleton line to Youghal. These proposals will be examined further as development in the areas concerned takes place and demand for services grows to a point where additional capacity may be necessary.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Some of these questions were submitted before the Minister visited Cork. In light of the Minister's comments, what are the ballpark figures we are talking about? I am sure the Minister had to get some sort of approval from the Department of Finance prior to his visit to Cork. Human nature being what it is, there is concern that in light of the timing of the visit, the commitment may evaporate after 11 June.With regard to the projected cost figures, what is the breakdown or ratio of the funding from the local authorities through the special development levies, from the private developers, from the State and from the European Union? Those figures are critically important if this project is to be used as a blueprint.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The estimated cost of the Mallow-Midleton suburban service is €89.7 million. That is broken down as follows: restoring the Midleton service track signalling stations — €56.3 million; new stations between Mallow and Cork — €9.4 million; and rolling stock — €24 million. This makes a total of €89.7 million.The Deputy asked from where the funding will come. It is proposed the Exchequer will contribute €32.7 million from the financial envelope allocated to public transport, the European Union will contribute €23.5 million and the levies and private investment combined will be about €34 million. Some of the figures have yet to be finalised. The €34 million must be pinned down. That is a ballpark assessment of the figure. The EU funding must also be fully finalised in terms of the actual amount. Those discussions are advanced. These are the ballpark figures although there may be some tweaking of them.I wish to pay tribute to the CASP organisation. The people involved in the plan went about their business professionally and in an organised way. That the local business community was able to offer more than €30 million meant the Government could examine the project. It is a template for any other part of the country that is thinking of reopening a rail line. This is an excellent model of how to approach the idea and assess it professionally. I pay tribute to all those who brought this project to Government and who made it an easy decision because of the professional approach and the manner in which they recommended it.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Am I to take it from the Minister's earlier reply that the extension of the line to Youghal will have to wait until the Department sees whether the existing line to Midleton is a success? Does he agree that the real key to success in the use of these new assets is the running of as many services as possible on the fixed line?Given that we are investing in the renewal of the Cork-Midleton line, which I very much welcome, does it not make sense to proceed immediately with the construction of a line to Youghal, given that a large section of passengers travelling to Youghal would use the main line in which we are investing? Such an extension would bring further planning benefits to that major developing town.Does the Minister or the Department have plans for similar development of the public transport system on the south side of Cork where there has been massive population growth but there is no such public transport provision? What public transport provision does the Minister have to offer people on the south side of Cork?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	270	The CASP study envisages all the developments to which the Deputy referred. The CASP contains proposals for extending the Midleton line to Youghal, but that will have to be considered in the longer term. It is not a project on which I can embark now. However, I will keep the proposal under close examination as we move forward to develop the Cork-Midleton line. The position is similar in respect of the proposal for the south side of the city. The development of the Cork-Midleton line is a major investment and has been identified as the priority by those involved in CASP. They indicated the other proposals are also important but that they would have to be considered in the longer term.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	271	In the breakdown of the figures the Minister gave I did not hear him mention any figure for the provision of park and ride facilities. In that context and in the context of the Luas, which I hope will be up and running soon, are there plans to run shuttle services to some of these railway stations? It seems there is a blinkered approach to the provision of services whereby we consider only the transport needs of the people within the immediate catchment area of these stations. Should we not consider developing significant park and ride facilities in areas where there are major junctions between the rail and road networks?Does the Minister agree that when the new motorways are constructed they will bring people into the cities much quicker but that traffic will be much slower moving around cities unless investment is made in public transport? If we can facilitate and encourage the development of park and ride facilities, it could alleviate some of these problems in the future.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Will the Minister explain why he cannot invest in the rail extension to Youghal? Is it because of a lack of money? If the development of that line makes such strategic sense, why are we not proceeding with it?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I am a strong supporter of park and ride facilities and substantial investment is being made in them. When I was in Cork last week I opened the Black Ash park and ride facility which is the first such facility in the country specifically tailor-made as a park and ride facility. I compliment everyone who made that happen in Cork. It will accommodate 700 cars and is located near the Kinsale Road roundabout. It is the first of many such facilities envisaged by the local authority in the area which received funding support from the Department of Transport.Regarding Luas, Deputy Naughten and Deputy Ryan in particular will be aware of the number of park and ride facilities being developed along the Luas line. There are also tax breaks for anyone who wants to invest in park and ride facilities. I hope significant use will be made of those in the future.It is too early to make a decision to extend the line from Midleton to Youghal. It is a matter of priorities. My priority is to do what we announced last week, namely, to re-open the Cork-Midleton line with new track laid. We will see how development progresses in those areas because such development would have to work up to critical mass.We are developing commuter lines. We had 3,000 miles of rail track 50 years ago and we now have a thousand miles of such track. If we are to develop the rail network, and I am a believer in doing that, there is a strong case for the development of high-speed intercity and commuter services. I intend to push ahead with those along the lines of this proposed commuter service. The case for other such services is not as clear but that does not mean we will not invest in them. There is no argument remaining against the value of providing commuter line services to and from high-density areas. It is the way of the future and I intend to continue to invest in those.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The taxi hardship payments scheme is based on the recommendations and parameters set out in the Taxi Hardship Panel report, as approved by Government.The Taxi Hardship Panel was an independent, three-person panel established to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi licensing regime. No prior parameters were imposed in regard to the recommendations the panel might make. It was, however, made clear at the outset that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in regard to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. Some 2,000 submissions were received by the panel and the panel also met with taxi representative groups and with some individuals who made submissions before finalising its report.The report of the panel recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. The payments range from €3,000 to €15,000 depending on the category of hardship involved. The Government approved the implementation on a phased basis of these recommendations. The payments in question do not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship.I have no proposals to re-open either the terms of the Taxi Hardship Panel report or the Government's decision in regard to it in so far as the recommended payment levels for each category of hardship are concerned.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	279	It is generally accepted there is a category of licence holder who was not adequately catered for by the Taxi Hardship Panel. It is those families who invested in taxi licences before deregulation. Those licence holders find it difficult enough to make a living, given the flooding of the taxi market, let alone make the repayments on what, in some cases, are substantial loans they would have taken out. Some licence holders would have taken out loans up to €100,000 on which the repayments are in excess of €900 per month. They are the real victims. The numbers involved are not large, but they are a category of people who are suffering serious hardship as a result of the Government's action.Will the Minister explain how the hardship a family in those circumstances is suffering will be alleviated through the payment of €13,000? Does he accept such a payment is wholly and utterly inadequate in alleviating such hardship? Will he again reconsider this category of licence holder because they are experiencing real hardship. The families concerned are experiencing great difficulties. Some of them have to sell their homes, some are experiencing marital difficulties and some have to cope with alcohol abuse because of the enormous stress they are under as a result of deregulation. I appeal to the Minister in the strongest possible terms to reconsider this category and how they might be further assisted.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	280	As the Deputy is aware, we had this discussion at a recent committee meeting. Whatever personal sympathy I might have for the category to which the Deputy referred — one would have to have sympathy for the case she laid out, assuming she has put forward a factual case — I have been presented with an independent report by Bill Attley, Kevin Bonner and Ann Riordan, three independent persons who came before the relevant committee recently. They went about their work diligently and professionally and produced a report. They met the groups and went through an entire process and recommended to Cabinet what type of compassionate payments might be made. The Cabinet accepted that recommendation without changing it and has stuck to it ever since.Some €8 million has been paid out to date to more than 660 applicants. As I said at a recent committee meeting, that figure is expected to double or even treble depending on how it works out in the end with ADM which is operating the scheme. It is best to proceed to make the payments as quickly as we can so that we can help as best we can those who have suffered hardship. The independent three-man panel made clear that the hardship payments scheme is not meant to remove hardship but to make a contribution to alleviating it.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Will the Minister confirm that the figures that have been set by the taxi hardship panel are the maximum amounts to be paid out? Will he confirm that people will be paid less money as a proportion of the hardship involved? If it is the case that someone who paid €127 for a licence will be eligible for a payment of up to €13,000, whereas someone who paid up to €100,000 will be eligible for up to €12,000, how does the Minister square the circle? It does not seem to tally with his definition of extreme financial hardship. That is part of the discrepancy, as is the fact that people receive €5,000 for dependent children. The figure seems to be the same regardless of the number of such children.Does the Minister not agree that there appear to be serious flaws in the hardship report? I refer to the manner in which the calculations are made to determine extreme financial hardship, as well as the criteria used to decide who should receive hardship payments.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Does the Minister agree that there is a great deal of hardship, especially in the Dublin taxi market, as a consequence of the number of taxis that are operating, many on a part-time basis? Does he agree that the problem would be solved if some type of entry standards were set? I would prefer if one of the standards was that taxis should be accessible to wheelchairs. An entry standard would, at least, help those full-time professional taxi drivers who have been in the industry for a long time.There is a need for some regulation of the numbers rather than allowing anybody to enter the industry to work on a part-time basis, as is the case at present. Does the Minister consider that such a system could be used as a means of ensuring that working as a taxi driver is seen as a full-time and well-paid profession rather than something people take up as an additional or second job?

I will check it again, but I think they are recommended payment amounts rather than maximum amounts. I think the panel recommended that the figures of €15,000, €13,000, €3,000, €6,000 and €8,000 be paid.

They are not maximum amounts. Nobody should get less than that. I will double-check it for the Deputy. That is my understanding of what it means. The Deputy has made the case for those who paid a substantial amount of money for a taxi plate and will receive compensation of just €13,000. The panel must take account of all such cases in assessing hardship. Attempts have been made to help on a case-by-case basis along the lines recommended by the report. The payments will not alleviate hardship, but are intended as a contribution.I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments about entry standards. The regulator has been identified by the Civil Service Commission. A name will be sent to me shortly for confirmation, which I will do. After holiday details and transitional arrangements have been worked out, the person in question is expected to take office in July or August.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 61 together.The Garda Commissioner has the power to determine locations for bus stops and termini. Under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, the Commissioner may issue a direction to a bus operator, identifying the specific location of bus stops and termini for any bus route. He may determine that certain stops may only be used for passengers boarding or leaving buses. I understand that the Garda engages in a consultation process with local authorities and bus service providers before it issues a direction under section 85. Section 86 of the 1961 Act empowers the Commissioner to make by-laws relating to the use of bus stops and termini. Such by-laws have been in place since 1962.The Road Traffic Act 2002 introduced a number of significant changes to the provisions established in the 1961 Act. Section 16 of the 2002 Act provides that responsibility for the determination of the location of bus stops and termini will be transferred from the Garda Commissioner to road authorities. This new approach reflects the evolution of policy and the development of the role of local authorities in traffic regulation and management since the passage of the 1961 Act. Section 20 of the 2002 Act provides that the Minister for Transport will provide for the regulation of the use of bus stops and termini. This ensures that the controls to be applied to the use of facilities will be contained in the same statutory framework that applies to traffic regulation generally.Investigations have been conducted by Dublin Bus and the Garda Síochána into the tragic accident at Wellington Quay on 21 February last. We await the reports of the investigations. Dublin Bus has concluded its investigation into the circumstances of the accident. The investigation will establish causes and contributory factors and will make recommendations to prevent a recurrence. The publication of the report of the investigation into the tragic events at Wellington Quay has been deferred, however, as a result of recent correspondence received from the Director of Public Prosecutions. Dublin Bus has informed me that it is committed constantly to improving safety throughout the organisation. Its commitment has been brought into sharper focus by the Wellington Quay tragedy.The Department of Transport has written to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann to ask them to undertake a review of all bus stops from a safety perspective and that is under way. Suggestions which refer to the location of bus stops and termini or to the use of such facilities will inform the development of the new statutory arrangements envisaged under the Road Traffic Act 2002, as will any matter that arises from the Garda investigation.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	301	The Department of Transport has written to Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann about the locations of bus stops and termini. Why has it not written to other bus operators? Given that it issued the licences, the Department should be well aware of who the other bus operators are.In light of the Wellington Quay incident and the impending publication of the report, does the Minister not think it would make sense to introduce common bus stops in Dublin and elsewhere? Bus stops should not be located higgledy-piggledy all over the place, one after the other, simply because different operators are involved. Is it not the case that this issue needs to be addressed, not only from a safety perspective but also, more critically, from the perspective of the Minister's proposals about deregulation and competition?The Minister gave a commitment in the House that the families of the victims would be fully briefed about the progress of all investigations, but part of the report was published in a national newspaper yesterday. Does the Minister not feel that it was a gross insult to the families that they had to read about this in a national newspaper, rather than hearing about it from the company itself? Is an investigation taking place into how the document was leaked to a national newspaper?

Perhaps my failure to do so was a symptom of an assumption that all bus stops are operated by CIE. There are not many other operators, but I will plug the gap by writing to them.I have been informed by the chairman that the company has been in touch with the families on a consistent basis. In recent weeks, the chairman personally visited a number of the families to inform them of developments in this regard. I want the company to keep the families fully informed at all times, within whatever legal constraints there may be, given the view taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I agree with the Deputy it is imperative that the families involved in this terrible tragedy should be kept fully informed. My understanding is that they are being kept so informed, but I will restate the position to the company.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	303	After the Wellington Quay tragedy, we asked the Minister to carry out a review of all the bus stops and termini in the city centre. At that stage, the Minister assured us that he was satisfied because they are kept under review and their locations are selected by the Garda Síochána and the city council. He is now telling us that, arising from the reports that have been produced, all the stops are to be reviewed. Will the Minister indicate whether terms of reference or other criteria have been established in respect of safety at those stops? Presumably, Dublin Bus was of the view that all the stops were safe so what measures will now be used to assess their safety?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The only terms of reference I gave were to instruct Dublin Bus to undertake a review of all bus stops from a safety perspective and for the organisation to satisfy itself that they were safe for pedestrians and for the operation of buses. There is no second check on that, if that is what the Deputy is suggesting. At this point, I do not have an independent authority that can second-guess Dublin Bus on the matter. Dublin Bus operates the buses and has told me in strong terms that their bus-stops are safe. We have had one terrible tragedy, which is being investigated, and Dublin Bus will now review all bus stops again from a safety perspective before letting me have the conclusions. That is the best way to proceed. If we had a separate safety organisation that could second-guess Dublin Bus, it would still be difficult to undertake a review of all bus stops throughout the city or, for that matter, the country.

Did the Minister talk to other bus operators in Dublin? Is it not the case that some bus operators in the city do not have official bus stops or termini? Does the Minister think that is acceptable in light of the Wellington Quay tragedy?Will the Minister give a commitment that all bus operators will be contacted and that the relevant points that emerged from the Dublin Bus investigation, regarding bus stop specifications etc. will be made available to all operators throughout the country?What investigation is being conducted by Dublin Bus on behalf of the Minister's Department, concerning how this report, which the DPP requested not to be released to the public, got into the hands of a national media outlet which published part of it? This is a critical issue, in light of the commitments the Minister gave to the House and the fact that Dublin Bus is answerable to the Minister and his Department.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I was just going to come to that point. I accept the Deputy's premise that private bus owners require a better deal, more certainty and a more formal role in our transport system, rather than the marginal role that has been allocated to them up to now. That includes providing bus parking space for them, as long as private operators provide a transport service of good quality. Part of the problem is the 1932 Act, which I am trying to reform.As regards leaks, I do not think the entire report has made its way to the media. The more sensitive parts of it concerning the issues on which the DPP took some views did not feature. There were broad references in the media as to what may be contained in the report, which led the DPP to take his view. Although I do not know for sure, my opinion is that the report is not in the hands of the media but that certain aspects of it have found their way into the media. I will not be able to get to the bottom of it from inquiries I might make in that regard.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Requirements on the use of seat belts in buses under EU law and national regulations apply to the driver and each passenger in a forward facing front seat of a bus up to 3,500 kg maximum weight, where seat belts are fitted.Directive 2003/20/EC, which was adopted in April 2003, provides, inter alia, for the compulsory wearing of seat belts by all occupants of vehicles, including buses where seat belts are provided. Under the directive, special provisions apply in respect of children under three years of age. Member states are required to transpose this directive into their national laws by 9 May 2006. However, it will be necessary to adopt a number of supporting proposals on type-approval standards concerned with the mandatory fitting of seat belts before the directive on the compulsory wearing of seat belts can be implemented and enforced. In this regard, last year the European Commission published proposals to amend a number of directives relating to the type-approval requirements for safety belts and restraint systems, anchorages for safety belts and seats, their anchorages and head restraints. The proposals provide, inter alia, for the mandatory fitting of seat belts in all buses and coaches at manufacturing stage, other than those used on staged-stop urban services. Under the proposals, it would be a requirement for the sale, registration and entry into service of new buses and coaches, from 1 January 2006, that their safety belts and restraint systems, anchorages for safety belts and seats, their anchorages and head restraints, would conform to the technical requirements specified in the proposed directives. It is expected that the proposals will be considered by the Council of Transport Ministers shortly, with a view to the adoption of a common position by member states. For practical engineering reasons, I have no proposals to require existing buses to be retro-fitted with seat belts.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	310	As the Minister is currently president of the EU Transport Council, will he consider the mandatory fitting of seat belts on all school buses that come into service? In the United Kingdom all school buses must have seat belts following the introduction of a mandatory regulatory system for all new buses providing school transport. Will the Minister consider introducing such a scheme here, given that a report published by the Oireachtas in 1999 called for such measures?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I share the same objective as the Deputy in wanting to see every bus fitted with seat belts on every seat, apart from local buses such as those used on staged-stop urban services. All medium and long-distance buses should be fitted with safety belts. That matter will be sorted out for new buses and coaches from 1 January 2006, assuming we can get some changes in type-approval standards.The assessment of the Department of Transport to me on the retro-fitting of buses, such as school buses, which are already in service is that it presents substantial engineering difficulties. The Deputy is probably making a distinction between school buses which come into service as opposed to those already in service. The buses which are in service provide virtually all the capacity at present. Not many new buses are coming into service and, when they do, they tend to be the older type of bus. The Department informs me that there are practical engineering reasons for requiring them to be retro-fitted and that starting with new buses is the most practical way forward.If the Deputy can suggest a way around this problem, I would be interested in pursuing it because I would like to see seat belts on every school bus from tomorrow if it were practical. Recalling them all or refusing to allow them on the road from a certain date could be considered, but there are substantial financial implications for the owners of these buses.

I suggest that the Minister speaks to his colleagues in the UK who have put in place such a system. Is it not the case that, under the current and planned regulations, it will be at least 2021 before any school buses have seat belts other than those for special needs children? Does the Minister not agree that it is unacceptable that school buses will not have seat belts for the next 15 years, even though they will be obligatory on passenger services in the intervening period? He should consider the introduction of a regulation whereby any bus which is commissioned for the school transport service would have to have seat belts fitted to them retrospectively.

That will commence the process and I have asked the Department to examine whether there is any way forward in terms of requiring school buses to have seat belts from a particular date.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	321	Scoil Mhicíl Naofa is a school in Athy with special classes for children with autism as well as mainstream classes. The teaching staff and the board of management are among the best in dealing with issues and driving forward the educational agenda set out by the Minister for Education and Science.It is with regret, therefore, that we must today seek facilities for some of the children in the school. In September 2003, the board of management of the school made an application to the Department of Education and Science to allocate resources for special needs assistance hours to the children. Despite a year having gone by, no such allocation has been made. Deputy Ó Fearghaíl and I have for some time met parents and the principal of the school to try to alleviate their concerns about this matter. Unfortunately, however, we do not seem to have made any progress in this regard with the Department of Education and Science.One of the problems is that there is no inspector for the school. We have been waiting for some time for the appointment of an inspector for the Athy area. Therefore, the school has a problem in that no one in the system is advocating the school as making a positive contribution through its work. Misleading information is also being given by the Department of Education and Science on the numbers of teachers there and so on. This was rectified by written replies to Deputy Ó Fearghaíl and itemised by the principal to ensure that the wrong figures were not being worked from.This school has been inspected on a number of occasions by the national executive and has been examined in regard to its work through resource hours, special needs teachers and so on. It has never been found wanting in any area. While the school has special classes for children with autism and mainstream classes, they have two separate identities. However, in determining the figures for the school, the Department seems to be rolling them together, giving the false impression that the school has enough resource hours and special needs assistance so there is no need for further hours and resources to be allocated to the school.Some nine children have attended the school since September 2003 and we are still awaiting a decision on their application. We are approaching the second year of their education and it is of major concern to the principal, teachers and parents of these children that nothing has happened. A new school year is approaching in September but there has still been no decision. No inspector has been appointed. Even if one were appointed, however, he or she needs a training period. When the inspector is appointed, will he or she take Scoil Mhicil Naofa as one of the first schools to be investigated to ensure that the he or she can put the school's case? The school has been inspected on a number of occasions in regard to the usage of the facilities allocated through special needs assistance hours and so on.That has been examined with a fine tooth-comb by the Department on three occasions and not one mistake has been found apart from the mistake made by the Department in dealing with figures. The Department of Education and Science should look seriously at the wonderful work being done in this school and ensure that when inspectors are appointed this is one of the first schools dealt with. I refer in particular to the nine children who have been waiting for almost a year for the facilities which will allow them to progress.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I am pleased to clarify the position of the Department of Education and Science on Scoil Mhicíl Naofa, Stanhope Street, Athy. The Department is most anxious that all children receive an education appropriate to their needs. The school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of two full-time resource teachers, two full-time learning support teachers, one of whom is shared with another school, three special class teachers for pupils on the autistic spectrum, two special class teachers for children with mild general learning disability, 16 full-time special needs assistants and three part-time special needs assistants.The Department has received applications for additional special educational resources on behalf of special needs pupils at the school in question. The Department received more than 8,400 applications for special education resources since 15 February 2003 and the batch of approximately 5,000 applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 is being considered at present. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of the Department's inspectorate and the national educational psychological service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of special education resource provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nationwide census of such provision.Processing the applications is a complex and time-consuming operation. However, the Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and officials from the Department will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to Circular 24103, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources allocated for special educational needs within the school.In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which the Department of Education and Science announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements, making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs and making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment, reduce the volume of applications to the Department for additional resources for individual pupils and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those for special needs assistants and those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year.The staffing for special classes for children with autism as outlined in the relevant departmental circulars is one teacher at a pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 together with two full-time special needs assistants. The school in question has three classes for children on the autistic spectrum with a total enrolment of ten pupils in the three classes. These classes currently enjoy significant staffing resources. There are three teachers, nine special needs assistants — eight full-time and one part-time — deployed to cater for the pupils in these special classes. The staffing for special classes for children with mild general learning disability as outlined in the relevant departmental circular is one teacher at a pupil-teacher ration of 11:1. The school referred to by the Deputy currently has two classes for children with mild general learning disability with a total enrolment of 18 pupils. There are two teachers and five special needs assistants currently assigned to cater for these pupils.The Department inspectorate reviewed this school as part of a sample survey carried out on resource teacher and special needs assistant support in 25 schools in 2002 and the national educational psychologist service is currently further reviewing the special educational needs supports required at this school.Applications for an inclusion class and a pre-school class for children on the autistic spectrum have been submitted by the school and are also being considered. It is hoped to notify the school authorities of the outcome in the near future. An application for major capital improvement works has also been received from the management authorities of the school.The 2004 school building programme has been published and full details of individual projects are available on the Department's website. On the basis of the funding allocation and the competing priorities for that funding, it was not possible to include the school in question. However, a key strategy for building projects will be grounded on the budget day announcement of multi-annual allocations for capital investment in education projects. All projects that are not going to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme will be re-evaluated with a view to including them as part of the multi-annual building programme from 2005 onwards. The Department expects to be in a position to make a further announcement on this matter during 2004. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position on this school.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this serious matter.Some weeks ago a serious drug dealing problem in the vicinity of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in the north inner city was brought to my attention, a problem made all the more serious in that very young children were being used by drug dealers as look-outs, runners and even to exchange drugs for money. This was happening during daytime hours and while the gardaí were active, and continue to be active, against the main drug dealers involved, with a number of arrests being made, their work was made more difficult by the involvement of children as young as ten or 12, as well as a group aged between 18 and 20 years.The anti-social behaviour associated with these groups and activities made life very difficult for local residents and in particular for senior citizens attending the Lourdes day care centre nearby. There was an atmosphere of intimidation from the groups of youths involved in this activity and it seemed to many that the area was going back to the bad old days and the open drug dealing in the early 1990s. There is a very active community policing forum in the area and its full-time co-ordinator organised a meeting of all the local projects working with young people as well as representatives of the Garda, the city council, public representatives and residents. Again, the gardaí responded very positively and their senior personnel in the area attended the meetings. The general response from those witnessing this activity was that the gardaí were doing all they could but that the same could not be said of other State agencies which clearly had a responsibility for certain aspects of the problem.People have rightly asked why young children could be drawn into a web of drug dealing in daytime hours when they should clearly have been in school. I would like a response from the Minister outlining the measures taken by educational welfare officers, or whoever is responsible for this matter, to identify children and teenagers who are absent from school. What measures are on hand to cater for these young people so they are not drawn into this web of drug dealing?Efforts have been made locally, with local projects creating a young people at risk process to co-ordinate all voluntary and statutory agencies working with young people at risk in the community. That process has been greatly assisted by the child care manager of the Northern Area Health Board but, regrettably, other agencies have not played their part. In particular it was felt that the Department of Education and Science, the vocational education committee and the probation and welfare service have not taken this matter seriously. They have failed to be represented at senior level in the young people at risk process or to attend meetings when invited.I hope that by bringing this matter to the attention of the Minister he will use his good offices to ensure all relevant State agencies play their part fully, that they respond in a more positive manner in future and participate fully in the young people at risk process. If we do not respond now, not only will more young people be dragged into the drugs trade by the attraction of easy money but some will end up as the next generation of serious drug dealers.It is ironic that the location where this problem has re-emerged was to have had facilities fast tracked and developed under the RAPID programme, if such a programme ever existed, and many of us doubt it. The national school nearby at Rutland Street was to have had a new modern school built in the adjoining Gloucester Diamond but Government cutbacks put that on the backburner. It has not happened and there is no sign of it. The Lourdes day care centre which has borne the brunt of the intimidation from the drug dealing was to have been given a brand new premises on a nearby site but again Government cutbacks have put that on the backburner. The Lourdes youth and community services were to have been provided under the RAPID programme with an ultra modern premises but that has disappeared.These are resources that are vitally needed in this disadvantaged community. I hope the Minister will look into this matter and ensure the resources are provided and particularly that the relevant officials from the various responsible State agencies do their job and participate in the young people at risk process in order that they can respond adequately and deal with the problem.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents, guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young persons. For this purpose, educational welfare officers are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.The board has appointed a chief executive officer, directors of corporate services and educational welfare services and a management team of eight staff. To date, 62 educational welfare staff have been appointed.I understand the board will shortly make a further educational welfare officer appointment which will bring the service delivery staff to its authorised complement of 63.At this stage of its development, the aim of the board is to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas, including areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme and most at-risk groups. Five regional teams have now been established with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and an educational welfare service is now available, for the first time, in the cities of Limerick, Galway and Kilkenny. Twelve towns with significant school going populations, 11 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, also have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. These towns are Dundalk, Drogheda, Navan, Athlone, Carlow, Wexford, Bray, Clonmel, Tralee, Ennis, Sligo and Letterkenny.In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally. Decisions relating to the assignment of staff to specific areas are a matter for the board, which is an independent statutory body. In 2004, the board will receive the first comprehensive data returns from schools and these will assist it in keeping the level of need for the new service in particular areas under review.I understand from the board that the service delivery staff have been assigned to specific areas of the country since early December 2003 and that three such staff have been deployed to work with schools, parents, teachers and pupils in the north side of Dublin, including the Dublin 1 area. Over 400 active cases are being worked by educational welfare officers at present.It is recognised that the difficulties experienced in disadvantaged areas cannot be solved by one agency acting alone. Education is but one of the many needs of the people living in these areas. The board is working in close co-operation with other services from the education, health and justice area so that children in need of special support are identified very early in their lives and followed up in a multidisciplinary way. I have no doubt this service will help prevent children and young people becoming involved in delinquent and anti-social behaviour in the future.There are a range of schemes, initiatives and services dealing with educational disadvantage at both primary and post-primary level. These include the school completion programme, the visiting teacher service for Travellers and the home-school-community liaison scheme. Each of these schemes contributes in a very positive way to promoting the education of children and young persons.As regards reports of drug dealing in the area, I am informed by my ministerial colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that local Garda management is aware of the drug problem in the environs of Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Sean MacDermott Street. One of the main suppliers has been arrested on two occasions. I understand he has subsequently fled this jurisdiction. There have been a number of arrests this year leading to seizures and charges.I am also informed by my ministerial colleague that the area will continue to receive ongoing attention from the Garda authorities. I also understand from the Garda authorities that the policy of the Garda Síochána on dealing with juveniles who offend is to consider the offender for inclusion in the Garda juvenile diversion programme. That programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution and the parents, guardians or persons acting in loco parentis agree to the terms of the caution. The Children Act 2001 placed this programme on a statutory footing and the relevant sections of the Act were commenced in May 2002.The National Educational Welfare Board has indicated it has received no individual complaints about the impact of drugs on school attendance in this area. However, the board has also indicated it is prepared to meet the Deputy to hear his concerns and to see how best it can respond. I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment. The Minister for Health and Children did not appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children today, as arranged, to answer concerns about the Hollywood report on radiotherapy. This does not augur well for any new responsibilities the Joint Committee on Health and Children may have to fill the vacuum or democratic deficit caused by the removal of the democratically-elected members from the health boards.This is a very important matter. There is a major problem. The Minister was in the Dáil and did not speak about the radiotherapy report or answer questions on the alternative report because he said he was going to meet the Joint Committee on Health and Children. The message was that the Minister was not available to meet us today nor would he be available next month or the following month and had other business to do in Europe. As far as I am concerned that is not acceptable. Thomas Paine who inspired the revolution in France and the US said: "A body of men holding themselves accountable to nobody, ought not to be trusted by anybody."The Joint Committee on Health and Children is a part of the Oireachtas. Its task is to shadow the various Departments. It is composed of Senators and Deputies. The Minister has a responsibility to come before it. Under the new structure being suggested, the Joint Committee on Health and Children will be part of the accountability procedure but this does not augur well for the future.The national cancer registry report proved once again that cancer survival depends on where one lives in Ireland. There are major deficiencies in the north-west, mid-west and the south-east. That the Hollywood report did not address the access problem is not acceptable. We have heard of various plans for private radiotherapy units in the south-east but none of these has any commitment to looking after persons with cancer who do not have money. If one has money one can have that service tomorrow, if not, one has to wait months for it. This is cancer care apartheid. Those who have money get a different service from those who do not have money.We are entering another tier of cancer care apartheid. One will get the multidisciplinary care — the surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy — as recommended in the report, if one lives in Dublin, Cork or Galway but not in the south-east, mid-west or in north-west. Even when the Galway unit opens for the north-west, it will be further away than Dublin. What is proposed is not acceptable. Those in the north-west are annoyed at what is happening. They are putting up with a lifetime of pain and opting for more radical surgery and a lesser chance of cure rather than make the long journey to Dublin. Why make people travel to Dublin, where they do not wish to go, from Donegal or Waterford when the service could be provided locally at the same cost or less? Does that make sense? Ill people are not able to make the 22 journeys that are required to treat prostate cancer.The staff costs are the same no matter where the unit is located. A unit could be provided in any area at a cost of €8 million. For example, a unit could be provided in either Waterford, Donegal and Limerick. Why does the Minister insist on spending €34 million on a unit in Dublin to where people will have to make long journeys by ambulance and arrive in a nauseous state? Is it fair that ill patients must travel such distances 22 times? A patient of mine who required radiotherapy died before he received a letter offering him it. That is a scandal. If he had money, he would have accessed that service and would have enjoyed a better life instead of dying in pain.That is a shame and what the Minister proposes is more of the same. That is not acceptable to the people in the south-east. The people will rise up and take to the street because the Government has let them down. The people in the north-west and the mid-west have been let down as well.

The Minister refers to the survey of patients, but 44% of patients surveyed travelled fewer than ten miles, a further 16% travelled fewer than 30 miles but a number significantly less than 13% spent more than two hours travelling. While the report acknowledged that 64% had difficulty travelling to treatment, clearly when the majority of patients selected had travelled fewer than ten miles one way and the largest representation of patients came from Cork and Dublin, travelling was not an issue in the way it was for patients who travelled long distances. The patient survey was flawed. Similarly, the Hollywood report is flawed. What the Minister is doing is not acceptable and I ask him to reconsider the situation and give a commitment for radiotherapy units to the people of the south-east and the north-west.

I am happy to reschedule a date in the future and look forward to meeting the joint committee to discuss in detail my plans for the development of radiation oncology nationally. I have discussed it already with the committee, most recently during the Estimates debate last month when the radiotherapy report was discussed. Normally such meetings are scheduled to suit both the members and the Minister in terms of being in a position to attend.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	332	With respect, I would like the opportunity to speak. The Deputy interrupts me all the time. I would appreciate it if I was given the opportunity to speak. I did not interrupt the Deputy. Why was the meeting scheduled for today when my office had indicated some weeks ago that I would not be able to attend?.The health service reform programme is based on the Government's decision of June 2003. This decision was based on the audit of structures and functions in the health system carried out by Prospectus and the report of the commission on financial management and controls in the health service. Both reports identified necessary organisational improvements to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and reform set out in the health strategy document, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You.The health service reform programme has been brought to the attention of all members of health boards and the regional authority. The Government agreed that health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority would be abolished as part of the overall health reform programme. The Health (Amendment) Bill 2004 is an interim measure which provides for the abolition of the membership of the seven health boards, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the three area health boards. It also provides for the abolition of the distinction between reserve and executive functions, with the assignment of those functions designated as reserve functions of the chief executive officers of the boards and the authority or the Minister for Health and Children, as appropriate.The Bill's publication represents a further phase of the implementation of the reform programme for the health services and is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to implementing the proposals in the reform programme, which include the establishment of the Health Service Executive on a statutory basis, scheduled for January 2005.The Government accepts that there is a need to strengthen existing arrangements for consumer panels and regional co-ordinating advisory committees in representing the voice of service users. These structures incorporate patients, clients and other users, or their advocates. They will work to provide a bottom-up approach to understanding the needs of service users at a regional planning level. These existing models are at different stages of development and will continue to be enhanced. These mechanisms will serve to bring the patients-clients' views and inputs to bear in the decision making process.I am aware that concerns have been expressed regarding the issue of public participation within the restructured health system. I have already indicated my intentions to bring forward proposals to provide opportunities for democratic input in the context of the new structures. I have given some consideration to the most appropriate mechanisms to support the development of appropriate interfaces at regional and local level between locally elected representatives and the Health Services Executive with a view to including provisions for these mechanisms in the legislation being drafted.The provisions are likely to include establishment of a series of regional fora to facilitate local representatives in raising issues of concern on health services within the region with the new executive. These fora would allow local representatives to comment on and raise issues related to the development and delivery of health services locally and regionally. Membership of the fora would be based on participation of a small number of nominees in respect of each local authority in each regional forum. The number has not been determined yet. Members of the fora would also have the facility to raise particular issues with the executive.My overall objective in putting in place such arrangements is to ensure that the voice of public representatives will continue to be heard in the development of health services. The members of the local councils will be nominated by the county councils and corporations. I am working, and have been working with the association of health boards in refining these proposals. These mechanisms would be designed to complement and reinforce the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in reflecting the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health system.The health strategy set as one of its objectives greater community participation in decisions about the delivery of services. The Health Boards Executive in association with my Department issued guidelines to the health boards on community participation which set out the principles and framework for structures for such participation. To date, most of the health boards have set up consumer panels that deal with a wide range of issues such as development and delivery of services. Two boards have also established regional advisory panels for older consumers and their carers. It is my intention that these structures will be established on a statutory basis in a Bill which I intend to bring before the House later this year.On the radiation oncology service in particular, I have outlined to the House and the committee on many occasions Government policy in this area. I have also outlined the significant progress that has been made in implementing the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The Joint Committee on Health and Children has already heard detailed presentations from a number of clinicians on radiation oncology services. One of the participants was Professor Donal Hollywood, who chaired the expert group that produced the report on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. In his presentation to the committee, he set out the basis of the model for the development of radiation oncology services nationally which ensures both quality and equity. The report, which has been endorsed by Government has received significant additional endorsement from prestigious bodies such as the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute in the US. The faculty of radiologists of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has advised the chief medical officer of my Department that the report and its comprehensive recommendations have been endorsed by the faculty. No less a figure than the renowned oncologist expert, Deputy Cowley, disagrees with the eminent bodies who know what they are talking about when it comes to cancer care and oncology.The implementation of the report's recommendations is my most important priority in cancer services in the acute hospital setting. I have provided additional resources this year to begin to implement the report's recommendations.The immediate developments in the southern and western regions will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators. This represents an increase of approximately 50% in linear accelerator capacity. We have also provided for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists. Recruitment for these posts is under way. We have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. This will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term. For the first time ever, the people in the west under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will get a radiotherapy service that they never had before and they will not have to travel to Dublin once the service is in place. That should be welcomed by Deputy Cowley and not denigrated.We will develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology, based on equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme.

The Minister has failed on this issue. There is also a belief that drug abuse is no longer a political priority. How does the Minister propose to deliver on the outstanding aspects of the national drugs strategy? The Government should have delivered on the drugs strategy by 2002. Some of the targets are already two years out of date.The crisis in confidence is clear. The Government produced a national drugs strategy in 2001 to cover the period up to 2008. A crucial number of elements of that strategy should have been delivered in 2001-02, the first year of this grand strategy, but remain undelivered. One element was that additional resources would be given to the drugs teams in the Garda to tackle the drug dealers at a local level. I give credit to the Garda which has had successes and which continues, despite a lack of resources, to target local drug dealers. That element has not been met.Action 7 mentioned in the strategy specifically promised an increase in community policing resources in local drugs task force areas by the end of 2001. I sit on the Rialto policing forum. We had to have a meeting with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to try to extract from him some money to pay for the administration of it, otherwise it would have collapsed as people were refusing to do any more work. Actions 48 and 51 promised that there would be a comprehensive and locally-accessible range of treatments and rehabilitation options by the end of 2002. That has not been delivered. Action 55 explicitly promised greater provision of alternative medical treatment. Again, the health boards have not moved on that.Astoundingly, no funding commitments have been made to the drugs task forces in the past two year, basically since this Government was re-elected in 2002. This has paralysed drugs task forces. I sit on one, so I know exactly what I am talking about. The Ballyfermot drugs task force is struggling to deal with the huge range of issues which raise their ugly heads and with which we must deal to try to tackle the increasing drugs problem in the area.The regional drugs task forces outside Dublin have not received any money, which is a scandal. If one looks at the total funding for drugs task forces, it is the equivalent to that given to the horse and greyhound racing fund, €63 million. It is nothing. It means this issue is not a priority and that horses and greyhounds are a bigger priority than tackling the drugs issue.If the Minister and the Government were serious, they would recognise the growing crisis in regard to cocaine use in Dublin. The drugs task forces are trying their best to tackle this issue but they are waiting on a mandate to develop and provide specific, appropriate and effective programmes to try to help cocaine users and to tackle the problem. This issue demands immediate action and requires resources. If we do nothing, we will have learned nothing from the heroin epidemic and from our failure 20 years ago when people warned that heroin would take hold in this city. We need to ensure projects are funded now and not in ten years. Those who are willing to work in this field must get the training required to tackle cocaine use in Dublin. The only conclusion I can draw is that the Government has exploited the media hype surrounding the drugs crisis. It produced a report and a strategy and promised much, but it has done nothing. It has put the strategy on a shelf.A group with which I am familiar and which does great work is ARC, Addiction Response Crumlin. It has the same budget now as it had in 2000, four years ago. It is down three workers and is deprived of the services these workers provided. That is a scandal resulting from the fact the Government has not provided additional funding. It has also allowed the health boards to cut the funding to mainstream groups. It is about time the Minister and this Government wised up, got real and understood there is a crisis. Unless they start to tackle it, we will be in the situation we were in in the early 1980s.

The message I continually get is that fantastic work has been and is being done. Of course, people will always say more needs to be done. I assure the House that the Government continues to prioritise the drugs issue and will continue to do so in the future. Much quiet work is being done; it is not about getting headlines in the evening paper each day.

It brings together into a single framework all those involved in drugs misuse policy. It arose out of an extensive consultation process and in recognition of the complexity of the issue. As we know, there are four main pillars to it and 100 separate actions.With such a strategy, it is important to have structures and processes in place. I chair the interdepartmental group on drugs which meets every month or six weeks. It comprises representatives of the different Departments and agencies dealing with the problem. In addition, every six months we send reports on the progress of the drugs strategy and the 100 commitments in it to the Cabinet sub-committee, of which I am a member. Good progress is being made and a number of the commitments have been achieved. We are behind on a few but——

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	342	——by and large, significant progress is being made on a number of them and few have been slow out of the starting gates. We recently published a critical implementation path for the strategy which was required. Work is already under way on a mid-term review of the strategy which is to be completed before the end of this year. That will give everybody involved in the issue the opportunity to make new submissions.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	344	It will also give us the opportunity to alter the emphasis, if necessary. A review steering group has been set up and a public consultation process will be undertaken shortly.The Deputy mentioned the Garda. The number of drugs seizures has increased considerably. Some €49 million worth of drugs were seized in 2002. Provisional figures for last year show that approximately €100 million worth of drugs were seized. In addition, the Garda has a number of good projects in place, such as Clean Street and Nightcap. The Department of Education and Science has brought in guidelines for drugs policies in schools. Substance misuse prevention programmes were introduced in schools in the local drugs task force areas initially and then in all schools.The number of methadone treatment places is now over 6,900. There has been a considerable increase in the provision of treatment in that area. The protocol for the treatment of under 18 year olds will be finalised shortly. Different phases of the national awareness campaign are ongoing. The Prison Service has recruited additional staff to implement the report on prison-based drug treatment services, including prison nurse officers. In addition, over 11,000 recovering drug misusers are on a number of FÁS community employment schemes.The drugs task forces are crucial and I am glad to hear the Deputy is a member of one. I was a member of one at one stage. Great work is being done by them. The strategy allows a little flexibility. There is no point comparing the situation now with that eight or ten years ago. The task forces are in place and are funded by Government. If the drug problem changes or evolves or if there is a move from heroin to cocaine, the structures are flexible enough to allow people to tackle it. Some of the people involved need a little upskilling, which we can provide. However, that does not mean we must set up a new task force. The Government is committed. The groups are in place, as is the finance.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 33, 41, 45, 65 and 85 together.As I stated in my reply to Priority Question No. 3, I am firmly of the view that franchising is the most effective means of achieving genuine market opening in the Dublin market. International experience in cities such as London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki is that franchising brings cost savings to public transport provision, savings which can be invested in the public transport system to ensure a better service to public transport users. A number of major studies carried out by independent consultants have supported this, including: the ISOTOPE report, carried out for the European Commission, which found that franchising generally resulted in savings of between 15% and 20% of the cost to the State of the provision of bus services, and the NERA-Tis report commissioned by the public transport partnership forum, which recommended franchising for the Dublin bus market.I have no proposals to privatise either Bus Éireann or Dublin Bus. The Bus Éireann and CIE reports referred to by the Deputies are internal company reports prepared, I understand, for the boards of the companies. The Bus Éireann report was copied to me by the company but the internal CIE report on subcontracting has not been copied to me. CIE and its operating companies are quite naturally undertaking work to respond to my reform proposals and I expect them to present the case which they see as representing their best interests. I welcome their constructive input to this dialogue but that does not necessarily mean that I agree with their conclusions.There are ongoing detailed discussions between officials of my Department and the CIE bus companies on my reform proposals. These discussions have covered a range of issues, including subcontracting. The companies have stated their preference for a continuation of monopoly rights using a subcontracting model. I am not convinced that such a model provides genuine market opening to new entrants or adequate value for money, transparency and accountability to the taxpayer.With regard to the discussions between my officials and the CIE trade unions, the most recent round of talks took place over an intensive five day period between 12 and 18 May. The talks were characterised by a full and frank exchange of views. The talks have now adjourned to early June to allow each side to consider the issues raised.It remains my intention to proceed with legislation on public transport reform in 2004.

My Department provides a range of financial mechanisms in support of this objective but it is important to note that the regional airports are not in receipt of State subsidies as such.With regard to capital funding, grant aid of approximately €9 million has already been paid to the regional airports under first round allocations of the regional airports measure of the national development plan, NDP. The primary objective of this measure is to facilitate continued safe and viable operations at the regional airports. A further round of projects will be considered for funding under the measure later this year.My Department also administers a grant scheme to assist the regional airports with marketing, safety and security related current expenditure. The total amount provisionally allocated in the Estimates for 2004 is €2.24 million and the individual amounts for each airport will be determined shortly.My Department provides subvention to contracted regional air carriers for the operation of essential air services under the public service obligation, PSO, regime. EU Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2408/92 allows member states to establish a PSO in respect of scheduled air services to an airport serving a peripheral or development region, where such air services are considered essential for the economic development of the regions concerned and where air carriers are not prepared to provide such air services on a commercial basis. In accordance with this regulation, the Government has established PSOs on routes linking Dublin Airport with the airports in Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo and Donegal. The total cost of air service subvention to PSO carriers amounts to over €20 million per annum.Regarding subsidy per passenger, it is important to note that subvention is not allocated by reference to the number of passengers using the services, per se. The governing regulation stipulates that subvention should be based on the losses actually incurred in operating the routes, taking account of costs and revenues generated by the services, subject to a ceiling represented by the amount put forward in the tender submitted by the successful air carrier during the tender process. In any event, the subvention level per trip per passenger for the past five years is as follows.

As in other EU countries, there are variations in the pass rate among test centres. The pass rate may be influenced by a number of factors including the number of lessons taken by the candidate, the standard of instruction available and demographic factors.With regard to consistency in the standard of the driving test, my Department undertook a comprehensive training programme for all driver testers in 2002, covering procedures for carrying out the test, guidelines to assess faults and training to enhance customer service in the delivery of the driving test. The work of each individual tester is monitored on an ongoing basis by his-her supervisor and remedial action is taken where this is required.The number of applicants awaiting a driving test fell from 125,009 in May 2003 to 121,153 as at 24 May 2004. The annual capacity of the driver testing service, inclusive of normal overtime, is in the region of 200,000 tests. I anticipate that the current waiting times will improve over the coming year. Driver testers continue to deliver additional tests by working overtime on Saturdays and at lunchtime. I have also asked my officials to explore the possibility of recruiting additional testers.Preparation of legislation to establish the driver testing and standards authority, which will take on responsibility for conducting driving tests and will have more flexibility to respond to variations in demand, is almost complete. It is my intention to introduce this legislation in the Oireachtas in this session.The pass rate for 2003 as well as the average waiting time and numbers waiting as at 24 May 2004 are set out in the following table.Test CentreAverage Weeks WaitingNumber of Applicants WaitingPass rate 2003%

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The Road Traffic Acts provide for the direct application of speed limits to all roads. Under the provisions of these Acts, a default speed limit of 30 mph applies to all roads, apart from motorways, in a built up area and a general speed limit of 60 mph applies to all roads outside such areas, apart from motorways. A default speed limit of 70 mph applies in the case of motorways.The Acts provide that local authorities may make by-laws through which the speed limits that apply on a default basis can be changed in respect of roads specified in such by-laws. These by-laws are made by the elected members of the local authorities following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and, in the case of national roads, with the consent of the National Roads Authority, NRA.In the context of an overall review of speed limits carried out against the background of the metrication of such limits generally, county and city managers were asked in January 2003 to examine the position in their areas. In this context, the authorities were asked to look at instances where speed limits might not be appropriate and to take any action they deemed to be appropriate. My Department raised this matter with managers again in March 2004, repeating the request to look at possible instances of inappropriate speed limits.Both the Automobile Association, AA, and the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, subsequently presented me with lists of over 50 locations in respect of which they had received representations questioning the speed limits currently in place. The details of current and suggested limits as received from the AA and SIMI, including the locations that the Deputy is referring to, were forwarded to the relevant managers. I wish to make clear that I have not requested or directed in any manner that the speed limit be increased or decreased at any of the locations concerned.Managers have specifically been asked to look at the locations that have been the subject of complaint to the AA and SIMI and, if the local authority considers that the speed limit is not appropriate, that steps should be taken to introduce appropriate amendments to the by-laws, which will see more appropriate speed limits applied. It has also been made clear that where, on the other hand, the local authority considers that the speed limit in question is appropriate and justified by reference to the prevailing road safety, engineering, traffic or environmental considerations, they have been asked to consider the provision of a sign informing road users of the need for that limit.I am awaiting reports from the managers on each location where the current limit is perceived by motorists to be inappropriate. I expect that these reports will convey either the grounds that support and justify the application of the current speed limit concerned or indicate that the speed limit in question is being referred to the council members for appropriate action.

With regard to Aer Lingus, I have previously indicated to the House that I recently advised my Cabinet colleagues of the current state of my deliberations concerning the future of Aer Lingus. I also advised that I will be reverting to Government on specific options for the company in the near future. My deliberations, which are ongoing at present, involve detailed consideration of the reports from the chairman of Aer Lingus and an independent corporate finance consultant whom I commissioned to look at the sale options for the company.If the Government decides to embark on a sale of all or part of Aer Lingus, I will be consulting with the Aer Lingus board, management and unions. In addition, in such an eventuality, I will set out for the House, in accordance with the provisions of the Aer Lingus Act 2004, the general principles of the proposed sale as well as the basis for the Government's decision and the arguments for and against such a sale. I will also set out how the Government proposes to deal with important strategic issues such as slots at Heathrow Airport.

The advisers assisted my Department in its analysis of projections and data provided by both Aer Rianta at group level and by the chairmen-designate in conjunction with local Aer Rianta management at Shannon and Cork Airports. The material compiled by PWC contains confidential and commercially sensitive information. I have provided the material to the unions' financial advisers subject to a strict confidentiality agreement which they entered into with my Department.The preparation of the material by PWC will not in any way inhibit the commercial freedom, and indeed responsibility, of the new airport authorities, when formally established, to develop strategic and business plans, including marketing strategies, for each of the three airports.The issue of Aer Rianta's main subsidiaries, including Aer Rianta International, is subject to ongoing careful examination by my Department and its advisers in the context of finalising the framework to give effect to the restructuring of the company and it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt the outcome of this work.

Accordingly, officials from my Department met with US officials in Washington DC on 4 and 5 May 2004 to explore the Ireland-US bilateral aviation arrangements in the context of progress on an EU-US open skies agreement. My officials emphasised the importance of Shannon Airport for the economy of the west of Ireland, in particular in the context of Ireland's national spatial strategy, which aims to counterbalance the growth of Dublin by focusing economic activity at a number of other locations. My officials also outlined the Irish Government's decision to separate Dublin, Shannon and Cork Airports into autonomous airport authorities to enable them to maximise their potential. In that context, they indicated that Shannon Airport needs a period of years in which to transform its business plans and marketing strategies.The eventual effect of an EU-US open skies deal, should such a deal emerge, would be to leave the choice of airports with the airlines. In the absence of special bilateral arrangements between Ireland and the United States in such a case, there is a risk that the open skies arrangement could mean a sudden end to the current Shannon stop requirement, which could have immediate negative impacts for Shannon.I met yesterday with the US Secretary for Transportation, Norman Mineta, at a meeting of European Transport Ministers in Slovenia. I emphasised to him that an acceptable arrangement for Shannon must be reached before I will be in a position to agree to any EU-US aviation agreement that might be put to the Transport Council on 10 and 11 June next.The implementation of open skies on a phased basis will also enable Aer Lingus to exploit the potential for new transatlantic business to the overall benefit of tourism and the Irish economy.

As I have already indicated in this House, I support the implementation of this proposal through the formation of a corps that will be separately identifiable and visible. A consultation process involving my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána about the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps is in progress. Discussions to date have included the question of the relationship that a dedicated traffic corps will have with the Garda and, in particular, whether it will be under the overall control of the commissioner. This issue is central to the development of this proposal.The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps that is independent of the Garda would require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish powers and functions of the corps and its accountability. In addition, the establishment of a corps that is wholly independent of the Garda would face formidable hurdles. The powers available to members of such an independent force would need very careful consideration and there is the overriding issue of the capacity of such individuals to engage in more general police work. The need for consideration of this issue has also been central to the discussions about this proposal.A working group has been established to urgently consider the options available in terms of progressing this proposal. This group comprises representatives from the Department of Transport, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, and the Office of the Director of Traffic. I will be chairing a meeting of this group shortly.

The primary focus of the examination was to ensure that the revocation of default speed limits and the application of special speed limits were supported by by-laws. In addition, the authorities were asked to look at instances where speed limits might not be appropriate and to take any action they deemed to be appropriate. My Department wrote to managers again in March 2004, repeating the request to look at possible instances of inappropriate speed limits and outlining the overall position on progress for metrication of speed limits later this year.Both the Automobile Association, AA, and the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, subsequently presented me with lists of over 50 locations in respect of which they had received representations questioning the speed limits currently in place. In order to assist managers in the review referred to above, they have been advised by my Department of the locations identified in the submissions of the two organisations.I wish to make it clear that I have not requested that the speed limit be increased or decreased at any specific location. Managers have specifically been asked to look at the locations that have been the subject of complaint to the AA and SIMI and, if the local authority considers that the speed limit is not appropriate, that steps should be taken to introduce appropriate amendments to the by-laws, which will see more appropriate speed limits applied. It has also been made clear that where, on the other hand, the local authority considers that the speed limit at the location in question is appropriate and justified by reference to the prevailing road safety, engineering, traffic or environmental considerations, they should consider the provision of a sign informing road users of the need for that limit. I am awaiting reports from the managers to see if the speed limits at the 50 plus locations complained of can either be justified as being appropriate or referred to the elected members for review and appropriate action.It must be appreciated that the national road network has a national context. An objective of the National Roads Authority is to endeavour to achieve the efficient use of these public roads and have regard to their level of service capacity. It is particularly important therefore that the fundamental considerations of road safety and efficient traffic management underpin any decision of a local council to apply a special speed limit in lieu of the default speed limit on a national road.The current statutory provision requires local authorities to obtain the prior consent of the NRA to draft speed limit by-laws on national roads. I am keeping the current statutory provision under review. Any proposal to amend the current statutory role of local councils in the application of alternative speed limits on national roads and motorways would have to apply to all county and city councils.

Government approval of the general scheme for that legislation was given on 27 April 2004. Details of the measures to be included in the Bill will be announced once the text has been finalised and approved by Government and accordingly published.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 49 and 69 together.Higher population and economic growth have led to a significant increase in car ownership in recent years, particularly in the greater Dublin area. To encourage people to use public transport more often, there has been a significant increase in the capacity and quality of public transport in recent years and further expansion is planned. In fact, I am informed by the Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, that, as a consequence of the major Exchequer investment, preliminary analysis of census figures shows a modal shift in favour of public transport.In terms of bus transport, the capacity of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann has been significantly expanded, particularly at peak times, with capacity increased by almost 25%. A key element in improving bus performance has been the provision of quality bus corridors, QBCs. So far, there are nine QBCs in operation in the Dublin area — Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, north Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Swords and Blanchardstown. QBCs have delivered significant benefits in reduced journey times for commuters and further expansion of the network is planned. This year, my Department is making available to the DTO about €27 million in quality bus corridor network projects in the greater Dublin area.Extended cycling facilities associated with the QBC network are also being provided. The provision of QBCs in other urban areas around the country is also underway. A sum of €8 million is being made available in 2004 for the development of QBCs in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. To further assist the performance of bus services, the use of the hard shoulder on certain roads, including those linking Dublin and satellite towns, is being examined. Amendments to road traffic legislation are required and the forthcoming road traffic Bill will make provision to facilitate this.Alongside bus service provision, rail based commuter services are being expanded. The first phase of the DART upgrade project is now underway, for completion by end 2005. This project involves upgrading the power supply to enable longer, eight car, DART trains to run over the full DART network. To accommodate this, platforms at DART stations are being lengthened and stations are being made wheelchair accessible. Some 40 additional DART cars will also be put into service as part of the project.On the Kildare, Maynooth and outer coastal suburban corridors, 80 new diesel rail cars have already been introduced, providing a significant increase in the passenger carrying capacity of these corridors. A further 36 rail cars will be added to the fleet in 2005, further increasing the outer suburban rail capacity. In addition, Irish Rail is developing proposals to provide four tracks on the Kildare line and to open new stations on that line as well as on the Maynooth line.At the end of June, the first of the Luas services will commence operation, with both lines providing the capacity to move over 20,000 people at peak time each day.The introduction of demand management measures to encourage the greater use of public transport is also being looked at by the DTO, which has a travel demand management study currently nearing completion. The study is looking at measures for better managing the demand for travel, particularly at peak times, and for more efficient use of Dublin's transport infrastructure. I await the outcome of the study.

I have not received a copy of the report from Iarnród Éireann.The chief railway inspecting officer of my Department is awaiting certain technical information from Iarnród Éireann before completing the statutory inquiry which I ordered on 14 October 2003. The chief railway inspecting officer also wishes to inspect the residual part of the viaduct when it is dismantled by Iarnród Éireann's contractors in June. When I receive the report of that statutory inquiry, I will carefully consider whether any specific measures are warranted.The Deputy will be aware that a Railway Safety Bill is currently before the House. Once that Bill is enacted, the railway safety commission, to be established under the Bill, will have extensive enforcement powers to address any safety issues which come to light from this or any other future incidents.

However, I understand from the NRA and Dublin City Council that the Dublin Port tunnel, DPT, is expected to be completed in July 2005. In parallel with the opening to traffic of the Dublin Port tunnel in 2005, I understand that Dublin City Council will be introducing a heavy goods vehicle traffic management strategy to ensure that maximum traffic benefits are secured from the DPT. The development and implementation of this strategy is primarily a matter for Dublin City Council.

Bus Éireann has informed me that a recent update of the study shows that the estimated costs associated with traffic congestion for the year 2003 are in the region of €19 million.While all bus operators face a difficult operating environment, I have made funds available to the local authorities in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford to provide priority measures for buses. To date there have been a number of successful quality bus corridor, QBC, programmes in Dublin and Cork and further initiatives are planned. I am also pleased that the demand for travel by bus continues to grow.

The RPA has set a target date of 2005 for the launch of the full smart card based integrated ticketing system in Dublin. It continues to examine all options to expedite the delivery of integrated ticketing with a view to bringing forward the proposed launch date. A first step was the launch last month of a smart card ticketing system by a private operator, Morton's, on its services while another important step will be the launch later this year by the RPA of smart cards on Luas services, with Dublin Bus introducing its system next year.In the meantime, integrated tickets, based on magnet strip technology, are available for travel on Dublin Bus and Irish Rail services and I understand that the RPA is about to conclude a similar arrangement with both companies in respect of Luas services. The allocation for integrated ticketing in the 2004 Estimates for my Department is €9.5 million.

The most recent report is in respect of 2002 and that report, along with reports relating to previous years, are available in the Oireachtas Library. Such commentary has not, to date, included specific details of a link between fatigue and fatal crashes in Ireland.In accordance with the medical standards for driving set out in EU directives, which are transposed into national law in the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations Act 1999, the medical examination as to general physical and mental fitness takes account of the susceptibility of the person concerned to fatigue, such that such person's ability to operate the controls of the vehicle might be seriously impaired. In addition, certification of fitness to drive may be specifically curtailed in certain instances such as where the person suffers from prescribed illnesses or disabilities or if using medications which would have an adverse effect on driving. In many of these instances, fatigue might be an attendant factor.The question bank for the driver theory test includes questions regarding fatigue so that learner drivers are aware before they commence driving of the dangers of driving while fatigued.The National Safety Council, which has been mandated with responsibility for promotional and educational initiatives relating to road safety, has produced a leaflet on driver fatigue. It has also organised a special promotion called "Driver Reviver" to address the problem of driver fatigue. This campaign was first launched at Easter weekend 2002 and, more recently, over the all-Ireland football final weekend in September 2003. On both occasions the campaigns were supported by Statoil, which provided service stations as "Driver Reviver" stops, and Lyons Tea. The council is currently in the process of developing and broadening the scale of the "Driver Reviver" campaign and anticipates implementing the campaign before the end of 2004.

I have received the revised outline business case for line 1 of the metro from the Railway Procurement Agency, the RPA, which involves a line from the airport to the city centre. The timescale, cost, precise route, number and location of stations and arrangements for a connection to the Luas line will depend on a number of factors including the Government decision; geo-technical surveys; negotiations with bidders; and railway order process including the public inquiry. In preparing a submission for the Government on this matter, the merits of all alternative solutions and routes will be considered.I am currently finalising my proposals on the metro in the context of the wider transport needs of the greater Dublin area. In advance of the Government considering these proposals, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matters raised in any more detail. I expect to bring my proposals to the Government before the summer.

If, in the future, land use plans make a sound economic case for such investment, then they will be examined. My Department is, however, currently funding bus based public transport projects in the Cork area that emerged from the Cork area strategic plan. To date, a total of €12 million has been committed to the park and ride facility at Black Ash on the southern side of the city with a capacity of 920 cars and the green routes initiative, which provides priority measures for buses on ten routes into and out of the city, including the routes serving the south side.Two of the green routes are due to be operational this year and proposals for the completion of the remaining eight by the city council by 2007 are being examined currently in my Department. In 2003, my Department also provided specific funding of €235,000 to Bus Éireann for the operation of the southern orbital bus service. In addition, the expansion of bus services serving the southern side of the city is also planned.

Specific allocations for individual RTI projects are made by ADM from funds provided for this purpose by my Department and I have no function with regard to the individual allocations.A sum of €3 million has already been provided for the RTI in each of the past two years and further funding of €3 million is being provided in 2004. This total of €9 million compares very favourably with the €4.4 million earmarked for the RTI under the national development plan. ADM is currently undertaking a comprehensive appraisal of the scheme. When the appraisal has been completed, I will then consider its findings and take whatever decisions are appropriate.

Work is underway on major projects on the N7 — Monasterevin bypass and Limerick southern ring road phase 1, on the N8 — Cashel bypass and on the N4/N6 — Kilcock/Kinnegad. Work is expected to start this year on the Dundalk western bypass and Dundalk to Newry on the M1, on the Fermoy bypass — N8, Waterford city bypass — N9/N25, and Naas road widening — N7. Completion of these projects will eliminate many of the major bottlenecks on these routes.In addition, it is expected that compulsory purchase orders and environmental impact statements for the remaining projects in planning on these routes will either be approved by, or be before, An Bord Pleanála by end 2004. With regard to the national roads programme overall it should be noted that since 2000 a total of 37 projects, over 250 km, have been completed. Work is in progress on 17 projects, 150 km, and another 17 projects, 160 km, are at tender stage.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 47 and 98 together.The national development plan provides for significant private sector investment in the national roads development programme. In line with this policy, a number of major road upgrade projects throughout the country are being implemented by the NRA by means of public private partnerships, with the private sector being remunerated in part by user tolls. This will ensure earlier delivery of vital national road infrastructure. Through PPPs, private sector innovation will be harnessed in the areas of scheme design, construction and long-term operation and maintenance.The NRA's current PPP programme comprises eight projects. In selecting these PPP projects the NRA had regard to a number of factors, that is, a geographical spread of tolls across the network, the extent of service improvement to be provided by the improved route, the availability of sufficiently high traffic volumes to ensure commercial viability and the setting of tolls at an affordable and acceptable level in order to reduce diversion and gain public acceptance. Having regard to these criteria it is clear that there is limited capacity, over and above the projects already identified by the NRA, across the national road network to support viable tolling arrangements. Nevertheless the increased cost of the national roads programme, combined with the demands of the other sectors which limit the capacity to allocate more Exchequer funding, require that all possibilities for generating additional funding to accelerate the implementation of the national roads programme be considered.In this context and that of a broader review of the arrangements for the delivery of the programme, the NRA has recently identified a number of options for the development of tolling policy to enable the NRA to raise additional funding for the national roads programme. The proposals submitted by the NRA are currently being considered, in the first instance, in my Department. Any decisions regarding the extension of tolling beyond the current PPP programme would be considered by the Government.

In accordance with it, NCTS is obliged to provide a car testing service for the State until 31 December 2009. Under the terms of the contract the performance of NCTS is subject to an annual review which can cover the results of NCT inspections, the results of planned or random sample test inspections, the results of customer satisfaction surveys, the audited financial statements, the company's financial position, customer complaints, the extent of compliance with performance standards and quality accreditation matters.The main inputs to the annual review are generated by the Department's rolling supervision of the NCTS with the assistance of a consortium consisting of the Automobile Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The consortium provides the Department with the necessary engineering, financial, legal, operations research and market research inputs to gauge the company's performance against the specified performance standards. In addition, the contract provides for a mid-term review to take place five years into the contract. While the mid-term review will cover matters dealt with in annual reviews, its overall focus will be more strategic in nature. It is my intention prior to the mid-term review to seek comments from all interested parties for consideration as part of the review.I have no plans to review the criteria for refusal of a NCT certificate. The national car test, NCT, was introduced in order to implement the requirements of EU Directive 96/96/EC relating to the roadworthiness testing of passenger cars. The directive specifies the items to be tested as part of a vehicle test. The NCT reflects both the requirements of the directive and those laid down in national regulations relating to the standards which a vehicle must meet for use on a public road.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	379	By letter dated 24 February 2004 the advisory council to the Commission for Taxi Regulation provided advice to me on a number of matters relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers. The council recommended the removal of the exemption on the wearing of seat belts by the drivers of small public service vehicles, the early commencement of section 37 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 which requires small public service vehicle and drivers licence holders and applicants to hold a current tax clearance certificate, and the introduction of a new identification badge for all drivers of small public service vehicles to replace the existing metal badge.I advised the council on 31 March 2004 that I had accepted its advice on these matters and had asked my Department to proceed with the consideration of the proposals in consultation with the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. My Department will publish the council's letter and my reply on its website in due course.I have recently announced that I will shortly sign an order to commence section 37(1) of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 with effect from 2 August 2004. From that date a taxi, wheelchair accessible taxi, hackney or limousine licence or a licence to drive such vehicles will not be granted or renewed unless the applicant produces to the licensing authority, that is, the local authority or the Garda as appropriate, a tax clearance certificate issued by Revenue under section 1095 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. I also expect to be in a position to bring forward amending regulations on the wearing of seatbelts by small public service vehicle drivers in the near future. The proposals regarding driver identification are the subject of correspondence with the Garda authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and their observations on the matter are awaited.

As outlined in that statement it is my intention to establish an independent authority to procure public transport services. I also proposed that all DART and suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area would be provided subject to a multi-annual public service contract negotiated by the independent authority with Iarnród Éireann.In reply to recent questions, I have stated that it is now my intention that the independent authority will have a national remit and in this context it is my intention that all rail services provided by Iarnród Éireann will be subject to a public service contract with the new authority. It is my intention to proceed with legislation to give effect to these and other public transport reforms during 2004.

I have not had sight of the paper as yet. A copy has been requested from the conference organisation.The road haulage division of my Department is responsible for the enforcement of EU rules governing drivers' hours, breaks and rest periods for commercial drivers. Tachograph devices are fitted to the cabs of trucks and buses to record information on the driver's activities for the purpose of checking compliance with the drivers' hours rules. These rules promote road safety by setting limits on the hours worked by drivers of heavy goods and large passenger vehicles.There are currently nine transport officers engaged full time on enforcement of these rules. The rules are also enforced by the Garda. Transport officers enforce the rules through roadside checkpoints and visits to operator premises. In recent years my Department has significantly increased the level of roadside checkpoints for enforcement of tachograph regulations. In addition, the level of multi agency checkpoints, which include inspectors from Revenue and other agencies as appropriate, was increased from 44 in 2002 to 98 in 2003. A total of 104 multi agency checkpoints have been scheduled for 2004. I am satisfied that these measures will help to ensure increased compliance with drivers' hours rules and contribute significantly to the promotion of road safety.

As I have stated previously, it is now my intention to establish an independent procurement and regulatory body for public transport which will operate on a national basis. This body will be responsible for procuring, promoting and regulating public transport.In carrying out its functions it will be subject to certain overriding objectives which will include the development of an integrated public transport system. This will include the integration of Luas, train and bus services and also ensuring that all operators are part of an integrated ticketing scheme. The establishment of this independent body will strengthen integration by replacing the current ad hoc and voluntary arrangements for service and ticket integration with a statutory basis.With regard to current arrangements for the integration of Luas with existing services, the Railway Procurement Agency is working with the CIÉ group companies and with private operators to achieve integration of light rail with other modes of transport. With regard to integrated ticketing, the Railway Procurement Agency has statutory responsibility for the delivery of a smart card based integrated ticketing system for use in a multi-modal, multi-operator environment. The scheme is being developed in consultation with public transport operators and the public. Where services are procured under a public service obligation by the proposed independent body, operators will not be free to set their own fares. Fares will be regulated by the body as part of the contractual arrangements for the delivery of services.

I intend to extend the system to cover the offence of careless driving with effect from 4 June next.The full application of the penalty points system will be achieved when the relevant IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are completed. I am assured by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that the systems in question will be operational by the end of this year. The question of reviewing the system will be considered against the background of its full operation.

The position as outlined in that response remains the same.I wrote to the chairman of the Railway Procurement Agency on 30 April last requesting that the agency review the level and extent of its current safety information programme, related to the introduction of Luas services. The chairman has agreed to this request. I also asked the chairman for the board's assurance that all reasonable steps are being taken to reduce to the minimum level practicable any safety hazards associated with the operation of Luas from the point of view of the public. This will be a requirement of the Railway Safety Bill in any case, when enacted. I am awaiting the outcome of the board's urgent consideration of these matters.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	386	The European Communities (Units of Measurement) (Amendment) Regulations 2002, S.I. No. 619 of 2002, lay down that imperial units of measurement may only be used on road traffic signs for speed and speed measurement until 31 December 2004. I intend to bring legislative proposals before the Oireachtas shortly that are required to underpin revised speed limit structures based on metric values. I have set up a broadly based metrication changeover task force to oversee the delivery of the metrication programme within the required timeframe. The tender process for the procurement of new posts and metric speed limit signs in currently under way. A consultation process is ongoing with relevant agencies and the preparation of a public awareness campaign is also being progressed.In the context of an overall review of speed limits carried out against the background of the metrication of such limits generally, county and city managers were asked in January 2003 to examine the position in their areas. The primary focus of the examination was to ensure that the dis-application of default speed limits and the application of special speed limits were supported by by-laws. In addition, the authorities were asked to look at instances where speed limits might not be appropriate and to take any action they deemed to be appropriate.My Department wrote to managers again in March 2004 repeating the request to look at possible instances of inappropriate speed limits and outlining the overall position on the progress for metrication of speed limits later this year. In order to assist managers in the review of speed limits, they were informed by my Department earlier this month of locations that were identified in submissions received from the Automobile Association and the Society for the Irish Motor Industry where the appropriateness of the current speed limit has been questioned in representations made to the latter bodies by motorists.Managers have specifically been asked to look at the locations that have been the subject of complaint to the AA and SIMI and if the local authority considers that the speed limit is not appropriate, that steps should be taken to introduce appropriate amendments to the by-laws, which will see more appropriate speed limits applied. It has also been made clear that where, on the other hand, the local authority considers that the speed limit in question is appropriate and justified by reference to the prevailing road safety, engineering, traffic or environmental considerations, they have been asked to consider the provision of a sign informing road users of the need for that limit.I am awaiting reports from the managers on each location where the current limit is perceived by motorists to be inappropriate. I expect that these reports will convey either the grounds that support and justify the application of the current speed limit concerned or indicate that the speed limit in question is being referred to the council members for appropriate action.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	387	First, I wish to express my regret at the sudden collapse of this company and the difficulties that it poses for its customers and staff.It is important to state at the outset that this company was licensed as a tour operator under the 1982 Transport Act, and was not licensed as an airline, even though its trading name may have given the impression that it was an airline. The licensing of tour operators is a matter for the Commission for Aviation Regulation.Flyjetgreen was using aircraft chartered from an airline that is a subsidiary of Icelandair called Loftleidir Icelandic. That airline is regulated by the Icelandic authorities. Iceland is part of the European Economic Area and is a full participant in the liberalised European aviation market.In accordance with the normal requirements to be licensed as a tour operator, Flyjetgreen had lodged a bond with the Commission for Aviation Regulation. That bond is now available to the commission to assist customers who need help as a result of the collapse of the company. It should be emphasised that the bonding arrangements are in place to assist customers of tour operators or travel agents, in the event of a company failing. Unfortunately tour operators and travel agents operate in a very competitive market and it is not unusual for a number of them to collapse from time to time. A bond cannot, in any way, prevent a company from getting into financial difficulties and collapsing, rather what a bond does is to help consumers if a collapse happens.I have no doubt that the Commission for Aviation Regulation would advise me if at any time it felt that the statutory provisions relating to the licensing and bonding of tour operators needed to be changed. There is currently no Irish legislation in preparation requiring the bonding of airlines. The focus of many airlines is to reduce the cost of flying. An airline bond would push airline prices up. In view of the competitive distortions that that could produce, any such measure would have to be introduced at European level.

However, a number of complex issues concerning implementation of this accessible taxi policy have yet to be decided. These include improvements to the existing wheelchair accessible taxi specification to accommodate the greatest possible range of people, issues surrounding urban/rural needs and the cost of suitable vehicles. These issues will be addressed by the statutory Commission for Taxi Regulation, when established, as part of the development of new small public service vehicle standards.The Taxi Regulation Act 2003 specifically provides that an objective of the Commission for Taxi Regulation is to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities. In this regard, the commission will be tasked with the determination of the future policy on accessible taxis. It is envisaged that this will necessitate specific discussions with both disability and taxi representative groups. The commission will also determine the manner and timeframe for the implementation of the standards for accessible taxi services.Pending the establishment of the commission, I have indicated to the advisory council to the commission that I am interested in its advice on a range of issues relating to quality enhancement and standards for small public service vehicles and their drivers, including general vehicle condition and appearance, and accessibility for persons with mobility and sensory difficulties.

At my request, the high level group on road safety has prepared a draft new strategy for the period 2004 to 2006 and I have received approval from Government to publish it. Arrangements are being put in place to provide for printing and publishing of the document, including its translation into Irish, as soon as possible.The preparation of the new strategy has taken account of the achievements in meeting the targets set out in the road to safety strategy 1998-2002, a comprehensive review of that strategy and further positive trends established in 2003, and the evolving developments in relation to the EU third road safety action plan. The strategy, which includes a report on progress achieved during the term of the previous strategy, will outline a range of issues that it is intended will be pursued over the period in question. In overall terms, measures will focus on the areas of education, enforcement, engineering and legislation and will target the key areas of speeding, driving while intoxicated and seatbelt wearing.

New infrastructure capacity and facilities, both airside and landside, will be needed to cater for this growth, including further terminal capacity. With regard to the latter, the programme for Government includes a commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at the airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits. The question currently at issue, therefore, is not whether new terminal capacity should be provided at Dublin Airport but rather who should provide the next tranche of capacity, the authority responsible for the airport as a whole or the private sector.As the Deputy is aware, the report of last year by the panel of experts chaired by Mr. Paddy Mullarkey concluded that an independent terminal at Dublin Airport would be operationally and technically feasible and that such a terminal is a viable strategic option for the airport. I will continue to give urgent attention to the independent terminal concept and I will bring proposals in the matter to the Government in due course.

I am informed that a heavy goods vehicle management strategy is currently being developed by the council to coincide with the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel. This plan has three objectives: to ensure the optimal use by HGVs of the port tunnel, to minimise adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city and to manage the movement of vehicles not within permitted dimensions, for example, through permit systems. I understand that Dublin City Council has circulated a draft interim report identifying the issues involved in the management strategy and that it is undertaking widespread consultation on the report before finally implementing any HGV management strategy.

In this regard, the question of a connection between the Tallaght and Sandyford Luas lines is being considered in the context of proposals for a metro alignment from the city centre to Dublin airport. I am currently finalising my proposals on the metro in the context of the wider transport needs of the greater Dublin area. In advance of the Government considering these proposals, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the matters raised in any more detail. I expect to bring my proposals to the Government before the summer. Local traffic management together with traffic data is the responsibility of the relevant local authority, Dublin City Council in this case.

Decisions regarding the deployment of controls on traffic and the application of the measures involved are matters for the local authorities and, in the case of national roads, the National Roads Authority.As the Deputy is probably aware, Ireland has international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. As part of our efforts to do so, the Minister for Finance has asked Departments concerned, including my own, to bring forward plans for a carbon energy tax with a target date for introduction of end 2004. Given the many and varied implications of such a tax, the Department of Finance has conducted a full public consultation with interested parties on the design of the tax. I understand that an interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of Finance, has been examining the submissions received with a view to preparing proposals for submission to Government by the Minister for Finance.

At my request this study also examined the question of increased use of the Phoenix Park tunnel for passenger services between Connolly and Heuston stations.The completed study has been submitted to my Department and discussions have taken place, with Irish Rail in particular, with regard to the project. The company is looking at the potential for making greater use of the Phoenix Park tunnel when the second phase of the DART upgrade programme is completed in 2007 and extra rail paths into Connolly Station become available.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I am anxious to ensure that as many practical measures as possible are taken to improve public transport flows and reduce congestion throughout the country. In that regard, my officials are engaged in discussions with Bus Éireann, the Dublin Transportation Office, the quality bus network office of Dublin City Council and the National Roads Authority regarding the use of the hard shoulder on roads, including those linking Dublin and satellite towns.The provision of hard shoulders for use as bus lanes can be facilitated through regulations made under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1994. However, as Road Traffic Acts provide that road speed limits apply to all of the vehicles using those roads, save where a lower ordinary speed limit applies to a particular class of vehicle, the application of a separate speed limit to vehicles using a reserved hard shoulder must be provided for in primary legislation.The road traffic Bill that is currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel proposes to provide a legal basis for the introduction of the concept of making by-laws to apply a special speed limit in respect of a specified national road or motorway or part, carriageway or lane thereof in lieu of the speed limit that normally applies to that road.

They were requested to review a range of options for increasing the operational height of the tunnel, their feasibility, having regard to the state of implementation of the current design and build contract, and the likely additional costs and impact on the project completion date.Having reviewed the findings of the report further information has been sought from the NRA pertaining to its conclusions, in particular about the costs should the tunnel height be increased. As a result the contractors have been requested to provide a fixed price cost for the work involved. Following receipt of this information a decision on the height of the Dublin Port tunnel will be made.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	401	The Competition Act 2002 prohibits anti-competitive practices and the Competition Authority is the independent statutory body charged with the enforcement of this legislation. Accordingly, allegations of anti-competitive practices should be referred to the authority for investigation. Given that the authority is currently carrying out a study of competition issues in the non-life insurance sector, it may be particularly interested in the circumstances of this case.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	402	From the information supplied it appears that the person in question is working in Ireland on the basis of a working visa rather than the basis of a work permit. Spouses of non-EEA nationals are not prohibited from working in the State. However, they do require an employment permit in their own right.In light of difficulties experienced by some spouses I recently announced new arrangements designed to give greater ease of access to employment for the spouses of certain non-EEA nationals working in the State under specified schemes and facilities, including the working visa facility. These arrangements are already in operation for some weeks now. Some 105 work permits have already been granted to eligible spouses.A detailed set of guidelines, outlining the eligibility criteria and procedures relating to these arrangements, have been available on my Department's website since April. They have also been circulated to a range of Government Departments, health bodies and other relevant organisations, including employer organisations, to promote as wide a circulation of this information as possible.There are about 30,000 non-EEA nationals working in Ireland on the basis of work permits and, as some 9,000 work visas or work authorisations have been granted to date, the implications of any proposal to grant automatic permission to work for other family members will need to be carefully assessed.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	407	The person named sought an exemption from certain qualifying conditions of the farm retirement scheme on the grounds of her ill health. She had ceased farming in 1995 and, as a consequence, was unable to satisfy a number of conditions including the requirement to have been engaged in farming for the ten calendar years prior to the date of transfer or lease of her land under the scheme to an eligible transferee. Only leases or transfers of pension lands to eligible transferees on or after 1 January 2000 are eligible for inclusion in the scheme.The scheme includes a provision for conditions to be waived where an applicant cannot meet them for certain reasons beyond his or her control, including long-term incapacity. My Department, while sympathetic to the situation of the person named, concluded that an exemption could not be granted in her case because she had been out of farming for nine years. The farm retirement scheme is fundamentally a restructuring scheme intended to encourage older farmers to retire early and give over their land to younger farmers. The fact that the person named has been out of farming for so long made it very difficult to accept that she was still in any meaningful sense a farmer. It is considered that the granting of an exemption in this case would have stretched the interpretation of the scheme beyond reasonable limits.The person named was informed of this decision through her agricultural adviser and advised of her right of appeal to the agriculture appeals office.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	409	1990 is the base year for carbon accounting under the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon emissions for peat and mineral soils are averaged on the basis that peat and minerals soils have comprised 30% and 70%, respectively, of the area afforested since 1990. Using this methodology and taking into account relevant scientific data, average soil emissions are set at 0.5 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year. With regard to sequestration, average rates are derived from area weighted average growth rates of tree species, taken from Irish forest inventory data. The inventory data cover all forests planted on both peat and mineral soil.My Department, through the National Council for Forest Research and Development, is funding research on many aspects of carbon emission and sequestration in Irish forests. As new data becomes available from the research, emission and sequestration figures will be updated as necessary.

The group examined all aspects of the scheme, including the qualifying medical criteria. I have received the report of the interdepartmental review group on the disabled drivers and disabled passengers, tax concessions, scheme and it is currently being considered. Any recommendations contained in this report regarding the medical criteria and other conditions of the scheme will receive full consideration.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The disabled drivers and disabled passengers, tax concessions, scheme is open to people with disabilities who meet the specified criteria and have obtained a primary medical certificate to that effect. The senior area medical officer attached to the relevant local health board is responsible for both the medical assessment and the issue of the medical certificate.The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers, tax concessions, regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: (a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; (b) persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; (c) persons without both hands or without both arms; (d) persons without one or both legs; (e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; (f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria as set out above is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate provides for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax, plus a repayment of value added tax on the purchase of the vehicle, plus a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also provided for. The Revenue Commissioners are unable to consider an application for the relief without the issue of a valid primary medical certificate.Application for a primary medical certificate should be made in the first instance to the appropriate health authority. In the event that a certificate is issued, application for relief should then be made to the Revenue Commissioners, Central Repayments Office, Coolshannagh, Monaghan, telephone 047 — 82800.

The closing date for applications under the 2004 scheme was 30 January 2004. I note that Fybough national school, Castelmaine, County Kerry, did not make an application under this scheme.It is planned to invite applications for the 2005 scheme later this year and full details will be posted on my Department's website at www.education.gov.ie In the meantime, the board of management should use the devolved grant for minor works to attend to any urgent works as required at the school.All applications for temporary accommodation have been considered in the school planning section of my Department. In the context of available funding and the number of applications received for that funding it was not possible to approve all applications received and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved. The application from Fybough national school was not successful.

When a vacancy occurs in the inspectorate, the schools concerned are normally temporarily assigned to another inspector in the region until the vacancy is filled. At present, primary schools in Athy, County Kildare, and neighbouring regions are assigned to a divisional inspector. A precise date has not been fixed for the assignment of schools in the Athy area to a district inspector, but it is expected that a district inspector will be assigned to the Athy area by November 2004.On recruitment to the inspectorate, primary school inspectors undergo a period of training usually for a period of between four and six months, depending on the progress of individuals and general conditions within the inspectorate.

The position is that SER applications received between 15 February and 31 August 2003 are being considered at present. In all, more than 5,000 such applications were received. Priority was given to cases involving children starting school last September and all these cases were responded to at or before the commencement of the current school year.The balance of more than 4,000 applications has been reviewed by a dedicated team comprising members of my Department's inspectorate and the National Educational Psychological Service. These applications are being further considered in the context of the outcome of surveys of SER provision conducted over the past year and the data submitted by schools as part of a nation-wide census of SER provision.The processing of the applications is a complex and time consuming operation. However, my Department is endeavouring to have this completed as quickly as possible and my officials will then respond to all applicant schools. Pending a response, schools are advised to refer to circular 24/03, which issued in September 2003. This circular contains practical advice on how to achieve the most effective deployment of resources already allocated for special educational needs within the school. The school currently has the services of one full-time resource teacher, one part-time resource teacher and a shared learning support teacher based in the school.In the case of teacher resources, the outcome for each applicant school will be based on a new weighted system of allocation which I announced recently. This system, as part of which an additional 350 teaching posts will be allocated, will involve two main elements: making a staffing allocation to schools based on a predicted incidence of pupils with special educational needs; making individual allocations in the case of children with more acute lower prevalence special educational needs.It is expected that the change to a weighted system will bring with it a number of benefits. The new system will reduce the need for individualised educational psychological assessment; reduce the volume of applications to my Department for additional resources for individual pupils; and give greater flexibility to schools, which will facilitate the development and implementation of improved systems and procedures in schools to meet the needs of pupils with low achievement and pupils with special educational needs.Transitional arrangements for the introduction of the weighted system are being developed at present in consultation with representative interests. As soon as those consultations have been completed, the detailed arrangements for processing applications for resources, including those received after 31 August last, will be set out in a circular to be issued to schools before the end of the current school year. It is intended, also, that applicant schools will be notified of the outcome in their case within this time frame.

The licence fee increases introduced by my Department for 2004 are to allow for inflation since they were last increased and to contribute to the revenues of the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards who are statutorily responsible for the conservation, management and development of inland fisheries in the State. The increase is consistent with the recommendations of the independent Estimates review committee on the 2003 Estimates for my Department, which concluded that it would be appropriate to increase charges in such cases.When introducing similar increases for salmon rod licences in 2003, I gave an undertaking that comparable increases would be applied to commercial fishing licences and that in future increases for all licence fees would be applied in line with the consumer price index on an annual basis. The increases now introduced mean that all licence duties in respect of inland fisheries have been set for 2004 in a fair and equitable manner. The proceeds from the increases will add to the regional fisheries boards' ability to maintain services, in addition to Exchequer grants in 2004. This additional revenue will be re-invested by the boards in the ongoing management and development of the inland fisheries resource.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132, 133 and 134 together.We are all agreed that over exploitation of fish stocks is a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of the inland fisheries resource. The Government has accepted the scientific advice to the effect that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required in order to sustain and rebuild wild salmon stocks on a district basis. For this reason, the current policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement in all districts and catchments up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limit in 2005.My Department has, over the past number of years, introduced a range of conservation measures which have seen considerable advances made in salmon policy and, in particular, the management of the drift and draft net salmon fisheries. As part of these measures, the commercial salmon fishing season is curtailed to a specific period.My Department has also introduced the wild salmon and sea trout tagging scheme regulations, which, inter alia, limits the total allowable commercial catch of salmon. I rely upon the advice of the national salmon commission and the regional fisheries boards’ managers in determining the terms of the scheme. Having completed its review of the effectiveness of the scheme for 2003, the commission proposed as part of its considered advice that the total allowable commercial catch of salmon for the 2004 season should not exceed 161,951 fish.I am advised that the salmon commission tendered its recommendation based on the advice of its own standard scientific committee and that the proposed total allowable commercial catch is consistent with its recommendation that a three year strategy should be put in place aimed at reaching the scientific advice on precautionary catch limits over the period 2003-05. The 2004 regulations also provide for a revision in the allocation of safety days for the snap net sector.The current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice by next year holds out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long-term sustainable fishery for both sectors.

For the present, work on the remaining 12 counties, plus the remaining part of County Cork, has been deferred pending completion of the GSI's input to the river basin district management projects which are currently under way or about to begin. However, work is proceeding on delineating source protection areas in Offaly and Fingal. The work on the RBD projects will also contribute to the eventual completion of the remaining groundwater protection schemes when they are taken up, probably in 2005-06.GSI lost one of its three senior hydrogeologists last year through resignation but is about to recruit a further three permanent staff to strengthen the capacity of the groundwater section, with a view to recommencing work on the groundwater protection schemes as soon as practicable. The GSI is in close and regular liaison with the relevant sections of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

Accordingly, the Deputy's questions have been referred to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he examine the matters raised and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	436	The number of patients on waiting lists as reported by health agencies to my Department was 27,318 as at end December 2003. This figure was compiled on the same basis as previously reported figures.The Department and the national treatment purchase fund carried out a comparative analysis of the number of patients reported to be waiting for surgical treatments. As a result of this analysis it became clear that the number of patients reported to the Department includes patients who are not immediately available for treatment or who would be unable to accept an offer of treatment for medical or other reasons. Therefore, the figures reported to the Department overstate the actual position at hospital level.The methodology used by the NTPF involves examining in detail the waiting lists reported by each hospital to identify each patient and the specific procedure or treatment required. Having identified the patients, the NTPF, in association with the hospitals concerned, carried out validation exercises of those waiting longest for treatment. This validation takes account of such factors as patients not available for treatment; patients not medically suitable to undergo treatment; patients no longer requiring treatment; patients postponing treatment at their own request. When those factors are taken into account the NTPF has estimated that a large number of patients, in the region of 4,500, can be deducted from the Department's reported figure.Figures reported by health agencies to the Department for the period ended December 2003 also included approximately 3,000 patients reported to be waiting for medical, as distinct from surgical, specialities. It is not clear what procedure or treatment these medical cases are awaiting. A group comprising representatives of the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the health boards, the national treatment purchase fund and the Department is considering how best to deal with the categorisation of these patients.As part of the commitment given in the health strategy to reform the organisation and management of waiting lists and also due to the fact that the NTPF has a multi-disciplinary team that works with individual hospitals to identify patients on waiting lists, I decided to transfer responsibility for the recording and publishing of waiting list figures to the NTPF. This will result in a more accurate and complete picture of the numbers waiting and, more importantly, the length of time they are waiting for their procedures. The important issue is that patients wait for treatment for the shortest possible time and that the actual lists tell us correctly how many patients are available for treatment. We need to get away from merely looking at the numbers waiting and concentrate instead on waiting times.With regard to waiting times, the NTPF has reported that 80% of patients now wait less than one year for surgical treatment. The NTPF has also reported that waiting times have fallen significantly in the last year with 37% of patients now waiting between three and six months and 43% waiting between six and 12 months for surgery. This represents a major reduction in the length of time patients have to wait.The NTPF has identified a group of 19,591 patients who are reported to be waiting more than three months for specific procedures, mainly surgical, and this group will now be targeted during 2004. There are 4,040 patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment included in the 19,591, who represent 20% of all those waiting.The NTPF has substantial capacity to treat patients and will continue to focus on reducing waiting times even further. The fund has the capacity to treat a minimum of 1,000 patients per month which means that its target is to treat over 12,000 this year. Maintaining referrals at this level will result in waiting times for surgical operations being reduced in line with the health strategy targets of three to six months. Currently, almost half of all hospitals now refer patients waiting for elective treatment between six and 12 months.As the NTPF has the available capacity to treat more patients there is no need for the majority of patients to wait more than six months for treatment. Patients who have been waiting more than six months for treatment can also contact the NTPF directly or through their general practitioners to arrange treatment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is classified as a group 1 carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The agency operates under the aegis of the World Health Organisation. Radon has been shown to be a cause of cancer, specifically lung cancer, on the basis of human epidemiological studies. Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of radon gas in an enclosed area can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer, particularly where other factors such as cigarette smoking are involved.My Department was advised by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland that radon exposure can be linked to between 10% and 13% of lung cancer deaths. This is based on international risk estimates on the radiation dose that would result from long-term exposure to the average indoor radon concentration here.Statistics on the number of lung cancers attributable to radon exposure are not available. However, the National Cancer Registry of Ireland has indicated that international comparisons of lung cancer, using the International Agency for Research on Cancer estimates for 1998, show Ireland close to the EU average for lung cancer cases and a little above average for lung cancer deaths. The NCRI further indicated that over 85% of these cases and deaths are attributable to smoking.Since 1997 there has been an additional cumulative investment in excess of €550 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. The investment has enabled the funding of 92 additional consultant posts in areas of cancer care. An additional 245 clinical nurse specialists have also been appointed in the cancer services area.The monitoring of radiation levels in the State is carried out by the RPII. It identified areas at greatest risk from high indoor radon levels and householders living in these areas are urged to carry out radon measurements of their homes and to take remedial action if high levels are found. The RPII also provides a radon measurement and advisory service.Radon in the work place is subject to health and safety legislation. Employers in high radon areas are required to carry out radon measurements and take remedial action if necessary. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has responsibility for building regulations that incorporate radon preventative measures in new buildings.

The system was outlined in the Government decision of June 2003 and is required by the establishment order of the executive. The change management team is composed of senior personnel from across the health service. It includes people working in health boards and the voluntary sector who have direct responsibility for the provision of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities.To date, the focus of the team has been on service delivery systems in the seven health boards, three area health boards and the authority that are scheduled to be abolished at the end of the year. The analysis of the existing system has also included engagement with service providers from the voluntary sector. Further workshops and meetings are planned to ensure that the views of all health service providers are reflected in the design of the unitary health system.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Government has not agreed that the State should indemnify any hospital consultant who is left without an indemnity by any of the medical defence organisations. The Medical Defence Union is the only defence body threatening to leave some of its Irish members without an indemnity. The Government has made it clear to the MDU that it expects the union to honour its obligations to its members who have paid many millions of euro over the decades to purchase indemnity cover. The Government has given a commitment to provide financial support to enable an individual consultant or a group of consultants, in an appropriate case or cases, to challenge a refusal by the MDU to provide an indemnity to a consultant.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The society has repeatedly asserted that it has sufficient assets to meet the estimated cost of all of the liabilities likely to be borne by its members, including its members in Ireland. Unlike the MDU, it does not claim that it will be unable to respond positively to requests for assistance from its members. Early this year, in evidence given to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, the society's CEO stated that it was fully funded to meet the cost of its reported and incurred but not reported liabilities.The society has just published its annual report and accounts for 2003. They suggest that it is capable of meeting its obligations to its Irish and other members.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	443	Last February, when personal injury claims against consultants were brought within the scope of the clinical indemnity scheme, concern was expressed that the cost of professional indemnity cover for consultants in private practice might become prohibitive. Due to the important role that the independent hospital sector plays in the provision of health care here the Government wanted to ensure that the cost of indemnity cover should remain affordable.Particular concern was expressed that indemnity cover for consultant obstetricians in private practice might not be available at any price. The Government decided that a limit should be placed on the amount of cover the consultants were required to purchase. The limit was set at €500,000 for each and every claim taken against an individual consultant. In addition, an annual aggregate limit of €1.5 million per individual consultant was placed on the cover to be purchased. The State accepts responsibility for the cost of claims that exceed these limits. These arrangements are not a subsidy to any specific defence body. They have been put in place for the benefit of the consultants concerned, irrespective of which defence body they wish to join. Alternatively, there are no barriers to a commercial insurer taking advantage of them to offer an appropriate insurance policy to the doctors for whose benefit they have been put in place.As far as my Department is aware the MPS is the only defence body or insurer that has offered indemnity cover to this group of doctors based on the existence of these arrangements. The annual subscription being charged to each doctor is €100,000. The MPS has indicated that the economic rate that it should charge is €350,000. At present, approximately ten doctors benefit from these arrangements and the notional subsidy to the group of practitioners is €2 million per annum. It is more difficult to estimate the likely future cost of this support as it depends on the number and value of future personal injury claims against them. The number of claims against them is unpredictable and likely to be random because of the small number of doctors involved.In the case of other specialities a limit of €1 million in each and every case was placed on the professional indemnity cover that consultants in private practice need to purchase. The ultimate annual cost of providing the level of support to these specialities was estimated at €5 million per annum.I am satisfied that these arrangements are a sensible and pragmatic response to a potentially serious problem that could have arisen if these doctors had been forced out of active practice by prohibitive indemnity costs.

Each health board is then required to adopt a detailed service plan consistent with set financial limits. Responsibility for human resource management within these parameters rests with the CEO of each board.It is a matter for each CEO to determine the specific appropriate staffing mix and the precise grades of staff to be employed, including staff graded as social care or child care workers and paid at the approved Department of Health and Children rate. Service plan priorities, regional service needs, national pay and employment policies are also taken into account.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.Last October I launched the report, The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland. The Government accepted its recommendations. It agrees that a major programme is required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. The first phase will be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway.Implementing the recommendations is my most important priority when providing cancer services in an acute hospital setting. As a first step I provided additional resources this year to begin the process. This year I shall make €2.5 million available for the supra-regional centre at University College Hospital, Galway. It has been built and equipment is being commissioned. Last year I approved the appointment of a consultant radiation oncologist. Recently I approved the appointment of two additional consultant radiation oncologists with significant sessional commitments to the North Western Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board. I also approved the appointment of a consultant medical oncologist.I have requested the Western Health Board to prepare a development control plan to facilitate an increase from three to six in the number of linear accelerators at UCHG in the medium term. I have also approved the establishment of a project team to plan the expansion in the region.Approval has issued for the purchase of two additional linear accelerators for the supra-regional centre at Cork University Hospital and the necessary capital investment of over €4 million to commission the service as rapidly as possible. In 2004 a sum of €1 million ongoing revenue funding will be made available for the development that will improve services for cancer patients in the Southern, Mid-Western and South Eastern Health Boards. Approval was issued for the appointment of two consultant radiation oncologists with significant sessional commitments to the South Eastern Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board.The immediate developments in the southern and western regions will result in the provision of an additional five linear accelerators, 50% of an increase. Provision has been made for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists and their recruitment is under way. At present we have ten consultant radiation oncologists nationally. It will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term.The report recommends that there should be two treatment centres located in the eastern region, one serving the southern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas and one serving the northern part of the region and adjacent catchment areas. My Department's chief medical officer was asked to advise on the optimum location of radiation treatment facilities in Dublin. A detailed request for submissions is being finalised. The CMO will apply the guidelines established by the group. He will be supported by my Department's hospital planning office and international experts.I intend to develop a national integrated network of radiation oncology, based on equitable access regardless of location and an effective national quality assurance programme. I established a national radiation oncology co-ordinating group as recommended in the report. It comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. Its remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. I expect the group will develop proposals for these important areas.The Government has also decided that when developing services consideration should be given to locating satellite centres in Waterford, Limerick and the north west. Account will be taken of the international evaluation of satellite centres, the efficacy of providing this model and the need to ensure quality standards of care.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	453	The national breast screening programme commenced in March 2000 with phase one covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and the North Eastern Health Board region. Last year I announced the extension of the BreastCheck programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford and a national roll out to the southern and western counties. In March screening commenced in Wexford.The national roll out of BreastCheck requires detailed planning to include essential infrastructure. Its clinical unit in the southern area will be at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork, with three associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick and Tipperary South Riding.The hospital considered it necessary to commission a site strategy study to ensure the integration of the breast screening services into its present and future development. My Department provided a capital grant of €230,000 for a study by professional architectural, engineering and quantity surveying experts. It has been completed and was submitted to my Department at the end of March. A detailed brief is being prepared by BreastCheck and the hospital. My Department will consider the project in the context of the framework for capital investment 2004-08.

Substantial work has been done to allow for the introduction of almost all of Part 2. Funds for the services have been made available to the health boards. The services have been piloted and are available.Part 2 provides for family welfare conferences, Part 3 deals with special care and Part 11 concerns the special residential services board and all are linked. Part 11 established the board on a statutory basis and it has commenced. In recent months a board has been appointed and the recruitment and appointment of staff, including a chief executive officer, has taken place.Over 120 high support and special care places were developed in recent years along with intensive community based services such as the youth advocacy programme pilot projects in the Northern Area Health Board and the Western Health Board. These developments cater for the small number of non-offending children in need of special care or protection. They will facilitate the introduction of the provisions of Part 2 and Part 3 of the Children Act 2001.Given the complexities involved, my Department undertook detailed work in conjunction with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the legal steps necessary for the introduction of Parts 2 and 3 of the Children Act 2001. At present the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel is preparing the necessary draft commencement orders prepared by both Departments in connection with this. Subject to this, almost all of Parts 2 and 3 will be commenced in the near future.Sections 7(1)(a), 10(2) and 13(2) of Part 2 will not be commenced at this time. They relate to section 77 of Part 8 that deals with the referral of cases, by the Children’s Court, of children charged with offences to health boards for the purpose of holding family welfare conferences. Consideration shall be given to commencing these sections when the expertise and optimal use of the statutory scheme has been established and having regard to the resources required and available.

The policy was endorsed in the 2001 health strategy, Equality and Fairness — A Health System for You.A number of initiatives have resulted in an improvement of dementia services. Significant additional funding was made available for the express purpose of providing assistance to carers, including carers of Alzheimer sufferers. The Alzheimer's Society of Ireland received funding to expand its services, particularly day care services. Day care facilities for people suffering from dementia were provided in a number of new community nursing units for older people that were constructed in recent years.The provision of health services for people living in the Kildare area is a matter for the South Western Area Health Board. It acts under the aegis of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has asked the board's CEO to investigate the matter and to reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.

The report describes a comprehensive palliative care service and acts as a blueprint for its development over a five to seven year period. My Department provided funding to all of the health boards on a pro rata basis to commence the development of the services in line with the report’s recommendations.Consultative and development committees were set up as recommended in the report. It was also recommended that palliative care needs assessment studies should be carried out in each health board area. Information gleaned from them and through the consultative and development committees will inform the future development of palliative care services at health board level. The ERHA has already completed a needs assessment study. The provision of extra hospice beds in the authority's area, including north Kildare, will be examined in the context of the study.

It recommends that a breast unit could be developed at Letterkenny General Hospital by linking with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry to increase its caseload, experience and expertise. Such a linkage is necessary to ensure an integrated multidisciplinary breast service, including breast surgery. My Department has advised the board that it is prepared to issue financial clearance for a permanent post of breast surgeon at Letterkenny General Hospital as recommended in the report. The board is preparing a submission for my Department on these lines.

The matter has been referred for advice to the Office of the Attorney General with a view to identifying whether a change in the current road traffic law is required. If it is the case that an amendment is required, I will bring new legislative provisions before the Oireachtas without delay.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	463	The Road Traffic Acts provide for the direct application of speed limits to all roads. Under the provisions of these Acts a default speed limit of 30 miles per hour applies to all roads, apart from motorways, in a built-up area and a general speed limit of 60 miles per hour applies to all roads outside such areas apart from motorways. A default speed limit of 70 miles per hour applies in the case of motorways. The Acts provide that local authorities may make by-laws through which the speed limits that apply on a default basis can be changed in respect of roads specified in such by-laws. These by-laws are made by the elected members of the local authorities following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and, in the case of national roads, with the consent of the National Roads Authority.In the context of an overall review of speed limits carried out against the background of the metrication of such limits generally, county and city managers were asked in January 2003 to examine the position in their areas. In this context, the authorities were asked to look at instances where speed limits might not be appropriate and to take any action they deemed to be appropriate. My Department raised this matter with managers again in March 2004, repeating the request to look at possible instances of inappropriate speed limits.Both the Automobile Association, AA, and the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, subsequently presented me with lists of over 50 locations in respect of which they had received representations questioning the speed limits currently in place. The details of current and suggested limits as received from the AA and SIMI, including the locations that the Deputy is referring to, were forwarded to the relevant managers.I wish to make it clear that I have not requested or directed in any manner that the speed limit be increased or decreased at any of the locations concerned. Managers have specifically been asked to look at the locations that have been the subject of complaint to the AA and SIMI and if the local authority considers that the speed limit is not appropriate, steps should be taken to introduce appropriate amendments to the by-laws, which will see more appropriate speed limits applied.It has also been made clear that where, on the other hand, the local authority considers that the speed limit in question is appropriate and justified by reference to the prevailing road safety, engineering, traffic or environmental considerations, they have been asked to consider the provision of a sign informing road users of the need for that limit.I am awaiting reports from the managers on each location where the current limit is perceived by motorists to be inappropriate. I expect that these reports will convey either the grounds that support and justify the application of the current speed limit concerned or indicate that the speed limit in question is being referred to the council members for appropriate action.

In addition, it must have an efficient braking system and be fitted with a bell that is capable of being heard at a reasonable distance. The Road Traffic Acts provide the basis for the application of a range of controls and restrictions on pedal cyclists. Many of the controls, some of which also apply to other traffic, are provided for in the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and 1998.The regulations provide for two types of cycle tracks, namely, mandatory cycle tracks, which are indicated by a continuous white line, which cyclists must use and other vehicles must not enter, except for access to premises, and non-mandatory cycle tracks which are indicated by a broken white line from which cyclists may depart in certain circumstances, for example, to pass a stopped bus or change direction at a junction, and which other vehicles are restricted from entering — save in very particular circumstances.

The location of bus stops is a matter for the Garda Commissioner under section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 in consultation with both the local authority and the bus service provider. I have recently asked both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann to undertake a review of all bus stops from a safety perspective.

They were requested to review a range of options for increasing the operational height of the tunnel, their feasibility, having regard to the state of implementation of the current design and build contract, and the likely additional costs and impact on the project completion date. Having reviewed the findings of the report, further information has been sought from the NRA pertaining to its conclusions, particularly about the costs should the tunnel height be increased. As a result the contractors have been requested to provide a fixed price cost for the work involved. Following receipt of this information a decision on the height of the Dublin Port tunnel will be made.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	471	As Luas will be operating within the constraints of the existing traffic signal sequences it is not expected that the existing unsatisfactory traffic conditions at the Red Cow roundabout will be significantly altered by Luas. Both the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and Dublin Transportation Office, DTO, are satisfied that Luas, despite the current unsatisfactory traffic conditions at the Red Cow junction, will be able to operate satisfactorily using existing traffic signal sequences, pending the upgrade of the junction as part of the M50 upgrade project. The trams are driven in much the same way as a car or a bus in that tram drivers yield to other traffic if they are confronted with a red light.The position in regard to the upgrade of the N7/M50 junction — Red Cow roundabout — is that the National Roads Authority, NRA, and South Dublin County Council are currently preparing plans, including a motorway order and environmental impact statement, for the upgrade of the junction as part of the overall upgrade of the M50. The proposed upgrade works at the Red Cow interchange are intended to remove as much traffic as possible from the signal controlled environment through the provision of additional structures and free flow slips that are separated from other traffic movements. This will significantly increase the overall capacity of the interchange and reduce the Luas/car interface so that both the road and Luas network will have increased capacity to maintain a satisfactory level of service.The proposed works will reduce the volume of traffic interfacing with Luas, namely, traffic crossed by Luas, by more than half. Subject to satisfactory progress in planning and design and securing An Bord Pleanála approval, it is expected that work on upgrading the Red Cow interchange will commence in spring 2005 and be completed by spring 2007.

This development will enable the separation of intercity and commuting traffic and increase the capacity of the line. I expect to receive shortly details of the proposed project, including cost estimations and timescale. My Department has provided over €600,000 to CIE to assist with the preparation of the railway order application and the company is in the process of completing the draft order. I understand that the application will be submitted to me later this year.The company has informed me that it has already increased the commuter capacity of the Kildare route by 130% since its new timetable was introduced on 14 December 2003. A number of the new diesel railcars, acquired by Irish Rail in 2003, were assigned to the route to lengthen the trains to eight cars. New turn back facilities at Hazelhatch and Sallins were installed to allow more efficient use of the available train paths into and out of Heuston during peak times.Irish Rail recently ordered a further 36 railcars identical to those recently placed into service. These new railcars will be used to boost capacity further on outer suburban routes serving Dublin.

This has been achieved by introducing to the route some of the new fleet of 80 diesel railcars. This latest capacity increase comes on top of a 100% increase achieved in 2001 when the double tracking of the route was completed. In addition, Irish Rail has recently placed an order for another 36 diesel railcars, which will be delivered in 2005. Some of these railcars are destined for use on the Maynooth line to increase capacity further.

The future development of public transport in the GDA is based on expanding the bus and rail networks.There are a number of major projects underway or planned: (1) the DART is currently being upgraded and when the expanded service opens at the end of 2005, a further 30% increase in capacity will be provided; (2) 36 new diesel railcars are being manufactured for delivery in late 2005 which will be used on commuter lines; (3) Irish Rail is looking at a rail spur off the Maynooth line to Dunboyne and providing four tracks on the Kildare line — in addition, new stations along these lines are planned; and (4) Luas services will commence on the Sandyford line at the end of June and on the Tallaght line at the end of August. In addition, there are a significant number of quality bus corridor projects underway or planned over the coming year or so, designed to improve the operating environment for buses.Other projects being considered include further extensions to Luas to the Docklands and to Cherrywood and a metro from the city centre to the airport.

Notwithstanding these increases, the processing time for such applications and declarations was reduced from two and a half years and 12 months at the start of 2001 to 18 months and nine months respectively at the end of 2003.There is no general policy applied which prioritises applications on the basis of nationality, duration of stay in the State and so forth. However, there may be circumstances in an individual case which require a greater level of investigation than other cases. In some cases, delay can arise as a result of failure on the part of an individual applicant to respond to queries.

As soon as I have reached a decision on the matter I will inform both the applicant and the Deputy of the outcome.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	478	The person concerned was deported from the State on 14 March 2003 having evaded a deportation order made on 25 April 2002. According to her own admission she entered the State in December 1999 using a false name and documents and worked illegally under this false identity. In January 2000 she claimed asylum using her real name but failed to pursue the application and became uncontactable. The asylum application was subsequently refused and she was afforded the opportunity to leave the State voluntarily before I considered making a deportation order against her. This would have allowed her to apply for a visa to re-enter the State again legally. When she failed to respond to the correspondence, I went on to consider her case for deportation under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 and under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1999, prohibition of  refoulement, and decided to make a deportation order.I understand that the person referred to married an Irish citizen in November 2002, after the making of the deportation order, and soon afterwards submitted a residency application. In the course of processing the residency application, my Department became aware of the abuse of the system perpetrated by her and refused the application on the grounds that she did not reside with her husband as a family unit for any appreciable time. I have considered an application from her solicitors to revoke the deportation order but, in view of the circumstances of the case, I have decided to refuse her application for revocation. The effect of the deportation order is that she must remain outside the State unless and until the order is revoked.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	479	In bringing forward legislative proposals, each Department is required as a matter of policy to consider the implications which the legislation may give rise to in a number of regards. Proofing from an equality perspective is an important aspect of such considerations and has been since the enactment and coming into effect of the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000. This policy is particularly relevant in the context of section 14 of the Equal Status Act which excludes actions required by or under an enactment from the scope of the Act.As regards the responsibility of my own Department in this regard, under the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts, independent equality bodies in the form of the Equality Authority and the Office of the Director of Equality Investigations — the Equality Tribunal — have been established to implement the equality provisions and provide for redress in cases of discrimination. As part of its role the Equality Authority is empowered under the legislation to refer cases which in its opinion involve discriminatory conduct by persons, including public bodies, to the Director of Equality Investigations.In the social welfare code same sex couples are treated as individuals which, in the majority of cases, is to the couple's advantage. For example, where each person of an opposite sex couple has an entitlement in his or her own right to unemployment assistance, the weekly rate of payment comprises a full rate payment and a qualified adult allowance. A same sex couple in the same situation is treated as two individuals and each receives a full rate payment.A case was taken last year by the Equality Authority on behalf of a same sex couple where one of the couple had an entitlement to a free travel pass but was refused a "married type" pass in respect of his partner, in keeping with the definition of a couple used by the Department. Legal advice received by the Department of Social and Family Affairs indicated that, as the Equal Status Act 2000 applies to all non-statutory schemes, including free travel, the failure to award the "married type" pass would be in breach of that Act, as an opposite sex cohabiting couple in the same situation would have been awarded the "married type" pass.It was the view of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that the application of different rules to statutory and non-statutory social welfare arrangements would not be sustainable in practice. The amendment included in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 represents an interim solution which restores the position prior to the free travel equality case, which is that for all social welfare arrangements a couple means a married couple or a couple cohabiting as husband and wife. When this amendment was introduced, a commitment was given to a fundamental review of the overall social welfare code regarding the requirements of the Equal Status Act 2000. This review will be done in consultation with all interested parties. The review will aim to ensure that any difference of treatment on any of the discriminatory grounds, set out in the Equal Status Act 2000, can be justified by a legitimate social policy aim and that the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.As the review will examine complex issues, with possible knock on effects to areas outside the social welfare area, and will involve a number of Departments, it will take some time to complete. The review will be based on a framework to be agreed with my Department. The scope and terms of reference of the review and the necessary arrangements for undertaking it will be decided in the coming months. Issues relating to social welfare legislation, such as deserted wives, are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

If work were to commence on all 17 locations simultaneously, it would prove difficult to project manage due to the complexity of the process and the geographical spread of the proposed system, and it would also require additional resources.In phase 1, the contract for the supply, installation and commissioning of Garda CCTV systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick was awarded to SKS Communications Ltd. The system in Dún Laoghaire has recently been completed and is now fully operational. The remaining systems are currently at various stages of completion. In phase 2, the pre-tender process for the CCTV systems in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is at an advanced stage. In phase 3, planning for the installation of CCTV systems for Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo is scheduled to commence later this year. The planning process includes identifying the proposed closed circuit television locations.Consideration is currently being given to restructuring of the manner in which these systems go to tender with a view to delivering the implementation of these CCTV systems in a more efficient and cost effective manner.

There was no indication given in the application, or in the supporting documentation, that the applicant had any relatives in the State.It is open to the applicant to appeal against the refusal by writing to the visa appeals officer in my Department. A full copy of the relative's passport should be submitted in support of the appeal.

If it were true, the total figure for births to non-nationals in the State in 2003 would be 600 but the number of births to non-nationals for 2003 in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, alone exceeds that figure by 88. The total figure for births to non-nationals in Dublin maternity hospitals for 2003 is 5,471.The referendum on citizenship arises from the need to eliminate an aspect of our law that exposes Irish citizenship to abuse. I have outlined the circumstances of that abuse in my contributions to the Dáil and Seanad during the debates on the Twenty Seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2004. In summary, the abuse comes about by virtue of the fact that under the law as it stands, it is possible for someone who has no connection with Ireland to arrange their affairs so as to give birth to a child in Ireland, whereupon that child acquires an entitlement to Irish citizenship. This is not acceptable to me nor, in my view, to the Irish people at large.

The national age card is not a Garda national identity card.Applicants receive their national age card within four to five weeks of producing the correct documentation at their local Garda station. Delays can occur due to incorrectly completed or illegible application forms.A number of initiatives are in place to advertise the national age card scheme. In addition to being available at Garda stations, application forms are also available at premises that are frequented by the relevant age group of 18 years and over, such as youth advisory centres, college students' unions and so forth. The application form is also available on the Garda Síochána website, www.garda.ie
Posters advertising the national age card scheme are clearly on display in all Garda stations and have been made available to all licensed and off-licensed premises as well as schools, colleges, clubs and youth groups. In addition, initiatives are organised by local gardaí who advertise age card use and availability to ensure exposure to the primary target group of persons aged between 18 years and 21 years. Some of these initiatives include advertising on local radio stations.The Garda community relations section continues to liaise with other State agencies, the drinks industry and relevant interested groups.

The Deputy will appreciate that the Children Act is very complex and comprehensive legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis.The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, inter alia, the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children, section 113 of the Act, and a court order which would require parents to exercise proper and adequate control over their children, section 114 of the Act.Section 111 of the Act provides that, "in any proceedings where a child is found guilty of an offence, the court may make an order for the supervision of the child's parents (a "parental supervision order") where the court is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child's parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child's behaviour."A parental supervision order may order the parent of the child to do any or all of the following: to undergo treatment for alcohol abuse or other substance abuse, where such facilities are reasonably available; to participate in any course that is reasonably available for the improvement of parenting skills; adequately and properly to control or supervise the child to the best of their ability, except where the terms of any community sanction imposed on the child make such control or supervision impracticable; to comply with any other instruction of the court that would in its opinion assist in preventing the child from committing further offences.The successful implementation of the community based options in the Act, including the new parental supervision order provided for under section 111 of the Act, will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. In this context, additional probation and welfare officers are being recruited. It is the intention that the community sanctions provided for in the Act will commence to be implemented on a phased basis from June 2004, as staffing and other necessary resources allow.

The directive requires, inter alia, the making of strategic noise maps for all agglomerations with more than 250,000 inhabitants, all major roads with more than 6 million vehicle passages per year, major railways with more than 60,000 train passages per year and major airports with more than 50,000 take off or landing movements per year no later than 30 June 2007 and the drawing up of action plans to manage any ensuing noise issues and effects no later than 18 July 2008.In a second phase, strategic noise maps and action plans are required to be completed by similar dates in 2012 and 2013, respectively, for agglomerations with between 100,000 and 250,000 inhabitants, major roads with between 3 and 6 million vehicle passages per year and major railways with between 30,000 and 60,000 train passages per year. My Department is in ongoing consultation with the relevant local and transport sector authorities on the directive's implementation in the context of preparing transposing regulations by the due date.The regulations will provide the legal framework within which designated competent authorities will implement the various mapping and action planning requirements of the directive within the stipulated timeframe of 2007-13.Dublin City Council, having to date published a noise map for the area between the boundaries of the Grand and Royal Canals linking land use, population density and traffic data, is proceeding to extend similar mapping to the city council boundaries.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	500	Government policy on waste management, which is based on the internationally accepted waste hierarchy, recognises the role of thermal treatment, incorporating energy recovery, as one of the mix of instruments involved in the modernisation of our approach to waste management. The issue of whether such a facility comes within the waste framework directive's definition of "recovery" falls to be determined by reference to the particular characteristics of the facility, taking account of relevant European Court of Justice judgments on this issue. In policy terms, the position of thermal treatment, with energy recovery, is well established within the waste hierarchy; after prevention/minimisation, reuse and recycling, it is regarded as an environmentally preferable approach to waste management compared to landfill.

The council subsequently requested the inclusion of the proposal as a major capital project in the water services investment programme where it would attract a higher level of departmental funding.The proposal was ranked fourth in the list of waste water schemes submitted by Kildare County Council in November 2003 in response to my Department's request to local authorities to undertake fresh assessments of the needs for capital water services works in their areas and to prioritise their proposals on the basis of the assessments. The priority lists were taken into account in the framing of the water services investment programme 2004-06 which I published last month. Due to the priority afforded to the scheme by the council, it has not been possible to include it in the programme.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	503	Due to the broad range of my Department's responsibilities in delivering social welfare and related services to citizens, my officials attend meetings of a wide variety of interdepartmental committees or bodies on an ongoing basis.Currently, officials of my Department are members of some 110 interdepartmental committees or bodies. This includes both groups for which my Department is the lead Department and those which are led by other Departments and on which my Department is represented. The frequency of meetings is determined by the lead Department for each committee or body and can range from monthly through quarterly to periodic meetings as required.The question of where meetings will take place and the frequency of meetings post-decentralisation will depend on the individual circumstances involved. The use of alternative ways of conducting the business transacted at these meetings will also be examined with a view to ensuring that business is conducted in the most cost effective way.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	504	On the basis of the information available to my Department, the position remains as set out in my reply to the Deputy on 19 May 2004.While the Deputy contends that he submitted an application form for fuel allowance on behalf of the person concerned, there is no record of this in the pension services office in Sligo. As already stated, an application form for fuel allowance was received together with a cover letter from the Western Health Board and a fuel allowance has been awarded to the person concerned on foot of this. Her late husband's fuel allowance book was received separately but without any covering letter attached.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	505	The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 16 April 2004. Entitlement to the allowance is subject to the applicant satisfying a means test and the medical eligibility criteria that apply. In this regard, a means assessment was undertaken by an investigative officer of the Department on 19 May 2004.Arrangements have also been made to have the person concerned examined by a medical assessor of my Department. This examination is scheduled to take place on 11 June 2004. He is being notified directly of the time and place for this medical examination. His entitlement to disability allowance will be further considered in light of the medical assessor's report and he will be notified directly of the outcome.Under social welfare legislation decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

The person concerned has been advised that he will be required to secure more reasonably priced accommodation in order to receive a rent supplement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	507	The South Western Area Health Board was contacted regarding this case and has advised that when rent supplement was initially awarded to the person concerned she was in receipt of one-parent family payment in respect of herself and two dependent children.Since the supplement was first awarded there has been a change in the person's financial circumstances. She is now in receipt of one-parent family payment in respect of an additional child. A recent review of her rent supplement took account of the change in her circumstances and the increase of €1 per week in the minimum contribution that all recipients are required to make towards their rent. This review had the effect of reducing the amount of supplement payable by €15.20 per month, which is the equivalent of €3.50 per week. The board has confirmed that she is in receipt of the maximum amount of rent supplement payable having regard to her current circumstances.

If he wishes to make an application he should contact the community welfare officer at his local health centre so that an assessment of his circumstances can be carried out to determine whether he has an entitlement to mortgage interest supplement.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-05-27 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Northern Area Health Board confirmed that the crèches in question will not close as a result of the decision to discontinue, with effect from 1 January 2004, payment of crèche supplements under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.As the Deputy is aware the bulk of the funding for the crèches in question comes from the health board. The board agreed to examine the financial support it provides to these crèches and this matter is currently under consideration. In the meantime, as an exceptional measure, health boards may continue to pay existing crèche supplements while arrangements for alternative funding are being finalised.
